25|$|The State of Maryland {{granted the}} B a charter {{to build a}} line from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., in 1831, and the Washington Branch was opened in 1835. This line joined to the {{original}} mainline at Relay, Maryland, crossing the Patapsco on the Thomas Viaduct, which {{remains one of the}} B's signature structures. This line was partially funded by the state, and was operated separately until the 1870s, with the state taking a 25 percent cut of gross <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b> This line was built in stone, much like the original mainline. By this time, however, strap rail was no longer used for new construction. Most of the stone bridges on the Old Main Line did not last long, being washed out by the periodic flooding of the Patapsco River and replaced at first by Bollman Truss bridges. The Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad to Annapolis connected to this line at Annapolis Junction in 1840. As an unwritten condition for the charter, it was understood that the state would not charter any competing line between Baltimore and Washington.|$|E
500|$|Serving {{a lightly}} {{populated}} area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, {{the last year}} of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at Wood Siding) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only £191 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{rebuilding}} reduced journeys between Quainton Road and Brill {{to between}} 35 and 43 minutes. From 1895 the Tramway ran four passenger services {{in each direction}} on weekdays. The population of the area remained low, and in 1901 Brill had a population of only 1206.

50|$|Passenger boats ran on {{the canal}} from 1783, and in 1809 fast boats were introduced, running from Edinburgh to Falkirk in 3 hours 30 minutes, {{providing}} such creature comforts as food, drink and newspapers. By 1812 they carried 44,000 <b>passengers,</b> taking <b>receipts</b> of more than £3450.|$|R
50|$|In {{its last}} full year of service, {{the line between}} Bletchley and Buckingham carried 6,600 <b>passengers,</b> with <b>receipts</b> of £4,000. This amount {{included}} 1,000 passengers travelling on Stowe School specials, who accounted for £1,250; the remaining 5,600 passengers brought in an income of £2,750, working out at two passengers per train. A Midland Red bus service provided a replacement service between local villages.|$|R
40|$|Travel by bus is {{the most}} common way to get from city to city. There is always a muavin (assistant) to help {{customers}} store their bags in the luggage compartment.

500|$|The {{rebuilding}} of the Tramway greatly improved service speeds, reducing journey times between Quainton Road and Brill to between 35 and 43 minutes. The {{population of the}} area had remained low; in 1901 Brill had a population of only 1,206. Passenger traffic remained a relatively insignificant part of the Tramway's business, and in 1898 <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts</b> were only £24 per month (about £ in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Although {{it served}} a lightly {{populated}} area, {{the opening of}} the GCR made Quainton Road an important junction station at which four railway lines met. The number of passengers using the station rose sharply. It had many passengers in comparison to other stations in the area. In 1932, the last year of private operation, the station saw 10,598 passenger journeys, earning a total of £601 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E
500|$|With trains {{travelling}} {{only marginally}} quicker than walking pace, and serving a lightly populated area, the stations at Wood Siding and Brill saw relatively little passenger use, and Wood Siding {{was removed from}} the passenger timetable by 1931; trains continued to stop on request.

50|$|The line is {{operated}} by Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co., Ltd and runs from 06:45 to 21:30, with services every 15 to 20 minutes. A one-way ticket costs ¥50 (US$8), or ¥40 ($6.40) for those <b>passengers</b> holding a <b>receipt</b> or proof of an airline ticket purchase. A round-trip return ticket costs ¥80 ($12.80) and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.|$|R

50|$|TransLink is a {{division}} of the Department of Transport and Main Roads that manages the planning, co-ordination, integrated ticketing and zoning for public transport services covering Brisbane and the rest of South East Queensland. It contracts Queensland Rail, private bus operating companies and Brisbane Transport to operate public transport services in allocated operating areas for a negotiated price, and keeps all fare <b>receipts.</b> <b>Passengers</b> pay common fares, {{based on the number of}} zones travelled through, on all the public transport modes covered - trains, buses and ferries, irrespective of who operates the service. In 2007, Translink introduced the go card smartcard-based ticketing system. Paper tickets are still available, but travel using the go card costs significantly less than using a paper ticket.|$|R
500|$|Improvements to {{the line}} carried out {{at the time of}} the {{transfer}} to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Wotton to Brill and Quainton Road to around 10 minutes and 25 minutes respectively. Serving a lightly populated area, Wotton railway station saw little passenger use, although it was the most-used station on the line other than Brill itself and the junction station at Quainton Road; in 1932, the last year of private operation, the station saw 2,648 passenger journeys earning a total of £144 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, {{along with}} London's other {{underground}} railways {{aside from the}} small Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership {{as part of the}} newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). As a consequence, despite it being [...] from the City of London, Westcott station became part of the London Underground network. The Brill Tramway was by this time losing significant sums of money. Goods traffic had dwindled, and unlike other areas served by the former Metropolitan Railway, passenger numbers were low; in 1932 Westcott station saw only 1,560 passengers and collected only £27 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E
500|$|Westcott was {{sometimes}} known in early years as [...] "Wescott". Two cottages for tramway staff were built {{next to the}} station in 1871. It {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. Westcott was a small village with a population of about 150, and passenger usage was low; in 1932 Westcott station saw only 1,560 passengers and made only £27 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b> The station building remains in place in the back garden of the former station house, now a private residence, and carries an exact replica of its original [...] "Westcott" [...] station sign.

40|$|In September 2000 an {{outbreak}} of influenza-like illness was reported on a cruise ship sailing between Sydney and Noumea with over 1, 100 passengers and 400 crew on board. Laboratory testing of passengers and crew indicated that both influenza A and B had been circulating on the ship. The cruise coincided with the peak influenza period in Sydney. Morbidity was high with 40 passengers hospitalized, two of whom died. A questionnaire was sent to passengers 3 weeks after the cruise and 836 of 1, 119 (75 %) responded. A total of 310 passengers (37 %) reported suffering from an influenza-like illness (defined as cough, fever, myalgia and weakness) and 528 (63 %) had seen a doctor for illness related to the cruise. One-third of <b>passengers</b> reported <b>receipt</b> of influenza vaccination in 2000; however neither their rates of influenza-like illness nor hospitalization were significantly different from those in unvaccinated passengers. A case-control study also found no significant protective effect of influenza vaccination. With the increasing popularity of cruise vacations, such outbreaks are likely to affect increasing numbers of people. Whilst influenza vaccination of passengers and crew may afford some protection, uptake and effectiveness may {{not be sufficient to}} prevent outbreaks. Surveillance systems and early intervention measures, such as antiviral therapies, should be considered to detect and control such outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|The Transportation Systems Analysis Model (TSAM) {{developed}} by Virginia Tech s Air Transportation Systems Lab and NASA Langley can provide {{detailed analysis of}} the effects on the demand for air travel of a full range of NASA and FAA aviation projects. TSAM has been used to project the passenger demand for very light jet (VLJ) air taxi service, scheduled airline demand growth and future schedules, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) benefits, and future passenger revenues for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. TSAM can project the resulting demand when new vehicles and/or technology is inserted into the long distance (100 or more miles one-way) transportation system, as well as, changes in demand as a result of fare yield increases or decreases, airport transit times, scheduled flight times, ticket taxes, reductions or increases in flight delays, and so on. TSAM models all long distance travel in the contiguous U. S. and determines the mode choice of the traveler based on detailed trip costs, travel time, schedule frequency, purpose of the trip (business or non-business), and household income level of the traveler. Demand is modeled at the county level, with an airport choice module providing up to three airports as part of the mode choice. Future enplanements at airports can be projected for different scenarios. A Fratar algorithm and a schedule generator are applied to generate future flight schedules. This paper presents the application of TSAM to modeling future scheduled air passenger demand and resulting airline schedules, the impact of NGATS goals and objectives on passenger demand, along with projections for <b>passenger</b> fee <b>receipts</b> for several scenarios for the FAA Airport and Airway Trust Fund...|$|R
25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the <b>passenger</b> seat, a <b>receipt</b> for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen any blood.|$|R
500|$|The {{station was}} heavily {{used during the}} {{construction}} of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor in the 1870s and 1880s. [...] The brickworks at Brill sent 25,000 bricks per week along the Brill Tramway, and 7,000tons (7,100t) of Bath Stone were shipped from Corsham. Aside from goods traffic associated with the building of Waddesdon Manor, the station was little used other than for shipping milk from nearby farms to Aylesbury and London. Inconveniently sited away from any nearby towns and villages, and with the far more frequently served Quainton Road and Waddesdon Manor stations within easy walking distance, the station saw very little passenger use. In 1932, {{the last year of}} private operation, Waddesdon Road station saw only 281 passengers and made only £4 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts</b> over the entire year.|$|E
500|$|Brill was {{valuable}} as a shipment point between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London. Around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station {{for the first}} train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. Brill station was relatively little used by passengers; in 1932 Brill and Wood Siding saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only £191 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b> [...] Since the closure, all buildings in Brill associated with the railway station have been demolished, {{with the exception of the}} station cottages, and the station site is now mostly open fields.|$|E
500|$|Waddesdon {{was known}} as [...] "Waddesdon Road Siding" [...] {{at the time of}} the line's opening, but was renamed [...] "Waddesdon" [...] when the line was {{converted}} for passenger use.

50|$|In India, cloak {{rooms are}} {{available}} in all major railway stations, where railway passengers can keep their luggage for a specific amount of time. Some of the bigger stations have 24-hour manned facilities, while the smaller ones operate only early morning to evening. This often suits day traders or pilgrims coming from smaller towns to larger cities and people waiting for a changeover to another train. Cloak rooms enable passengers to avoid carrying their luggage through the city while they conduct their business or tourism. The facilities are operated by the Commercial Department of Indian Railways at all major railway stations; smaller railway stations may not have this facility. A clerk collects the luggage from the passengers alighting from a train at that station or passengers having a train from that station, after verifying their tickets. The locked luggage bags are collected and a receipt is issued, mentioning the date and time the luggage was surrendered. The items are then stored on racks in the cloak room. Passengers are advised not to store valuable items or personal effects in the bags. On return, <b>passengers</b> show their <b>receipt,</b> pay the necessary charges to the clerk, and collect their items.|$|R
500|$|Wotton was a {{focal point}} of the line, and the site of the Tramway's forge and the stables for its horses. With a {{population}} {{at the time of the}} line's opening of 220, Wotton served a smaller populated area than Brill, but as the loading place for goods from Church Siding and the Kingswood branch it handled the majority of goods traffic. As much as 90 per cent of milk traffic carried by the Tramway was loaded at Wotton. The station was situated on a sharp curve and, had the extension to Oxford been built, it would have needed resiting to accommodate longer and faster trains. Wotton had the highest passenger numbers on the line other than Brill itself and the junction station at Quainton Road; in 1932 the station saw 2,648 passenger journeys earning a total of £144 (about £ in [...] ) in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b> Wotton station on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which in 1923 had been taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1925 the {{shipping}} firm of Langley Bros, went into voluntary liquidation [...] with {{the shipping}} fleet {{offered for sale}} by public tender following serious competition from the New South Wales Government railways in the Coff's Harbour trade.

2500|$|Beeching first studied traffic flows on all {{lines to}} {{identify}} [...] "the good, the bad, and the indifferent". His {{analysis showed that}} the least-used 1,762 stations had annual <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts</b> of less than £2,500 each (£ as of [...] ), that {{over half of the}} 4,300 stations open to passengers in 1960 had receipts of less than £10,000, that the least-used 50% of stations contributed only 2% of passenger revenue, and that one third of route miles carried just 1% of passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Smeeth, a {{scattered}} {{village community}} {{of a few}} hundred persons in the early 1840s, was initially ignored by the South Eastern Railway (SER) when it constructed its main line through the area to reach Folkestone. Situated [...] from Ashford, the small village was primarily a farming community producing wheat, barley, oats, beans and peas; the grain was processed at Evegate Mill on the River Stour to the south of the railway line, which was the most substantial structure in the area. In 1850, six years after opening the South Eastern Main Line, a deputation of local tradesmen pressed the SER to open a station in the village, arguing that the potential goods traffic that could be generated would outweigh the lack of <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b> Although there was little to suggest that Smeeth could justify and support a railway station, the SER agreed to the venture. A site was chosen [...] to the south of the village at a point where the Bonnington to Smeeth road (now the B2069) crossed the railway line. The land was owned by the Knatchbull-Hugessen family, Sir Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen being the local Member of Parliament and, in later years, a director of the SER.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Hacheston Halt {{was opened}} {{in an attempt}} to improve the line's poor <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Throughout its {{independent}} existence, the SER {{was primarily}} a passenger rather than a freight railway, with <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts</b> accounting for more than 72% of its revenues.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, {{the freight}} revenue from this line was $1.9 million, with an {{additional}} $162,000 in <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts,</b> qualifying it as a Class I railroad in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Nottage Halt {{closed to}} {{passengers}} in 1963, {{along with the}} whole of the Porthcawl branch. The closure came despite the fact that <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts</b> remained profitable. The line through the station closed in 1965.|$|E
50|$|Baughan {{says that}} {{passenger}} carriages ran with the mineral trains from 1904, but this ended {{on the first}} day of 1917. Mineral revenue was about twenty times the value of <b>passenger</b> <b>receipts,</b> and the latter declined further in the 1920s and 1930s as reliable road transport was developed.|$|E
