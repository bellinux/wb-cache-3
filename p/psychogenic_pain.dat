40|$|Pain is an unpleasant, {{sensitive}} and emotional experience associated with or {{described in terms}} of tissue lesion, and may be acute or chronic. It may also be classified as nociceptive, neuropathic or <b>psychogenic.</b> Nociceptive <b>pain</b> involves the transformation of environmental stimuli into action potentials carried to the central nervous system, where they are modulated and integrated up to final interpretation in the cerebral cortex. Neuropathic pain may arise {{as a consequence of the}} direct lesion of axons, or of an increase in the production of neurotrophic factors. Chronic pain is always associated with anxiety and some degree of depression. Drug therapy should be selected according to its efficacy; nonetheless, the professional should also consider the tolerability and adverse effects that may occur, for example, in elderly individuals. It is necessary to emphasize the safety-considering the possibility of drug interactions-and define the posology to promote better adherence.

5000|$|The {{prognosis}} is worse {{when there are}} more areas of pain reported. Treatment may include psychotherapy (with cognitive-behavioral therapy or operant conditioning), medication (often with antidepressants but also with pain medications), and sleep therapy. According to a study performed at the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, antidepressants have an analgesic effect on patients suffering from pain disorder. In a randomized, placebo-controlled antidepressant treatment study, researchers found that [...] "antidepressants decreased pain intensity in patients with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> or somatoform pain disorder significantly more than placebo". Prescription and nonprescription pain medications do not help and can actually hurt if the patient suffers side effects or develops an addiction. Instead, antidpressants and talk therapy are recommended. CBT helps patients learn what worsens the pain, how to cope, and how to function in their life while handling the pain. Antidepressants work against the pain and worry. Unfortunately, many people {{do not believe the}} pain [...] "is all in their head," [...] so they refuse such treatments. Other techniques used in the management of chronic pain may also be of use; these include massage, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, trigger point injections, surgical ablation, and non-interventional therapies such as meditation, yoga, and music and art therapy.|$|E
40|$|The <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> {{disorder}} is {{a diagnosis of}} its own besides the conversion disorder since 1977. In the actual retrospective study clinical and sociodemographic features are examined between the patients with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> and the patients with different psychogenic symptoms. Pain is a frequent psychogenic symptom. In this study 32, 5 % of the 274 patients with psychogenic symptoms had pain as leading symptom. Taking leading and accompanying symptoms together even 63, 5 % reported pain. Comparing the patients with pain as leading psychogenic symptom versus the patients with a different leading symptom than pain there did not show significant differences concerning most of the examined sociodemographic and clinical features. But there were some the groups differentiating aspects: Patients with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> showed more frequent depressions and were prescribed more frequent antidepressive medication. They reported more frequent a long-standing disturbance (> 30 days) at the index-examination and showed more frequent a chronification as well as attempted more suicides. After a duration of {{more than six months}} and more than two years a detoriation of the prognosis was found. A <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> disorder should therefore be diagnosed {{in the first six months}} in order to make an early therapeutic intervention possible. To demand a duration of six months for diagnosing a somatoform pain {{disorder is}} not helpful, as demanded in the ICD- 10 and the DSM-III-R. Regarding the differences it is reasonable to have <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> as a disorder of its own besides the conversion or dissociative disorder. The patients, who had a different leading psychogenic symptom than pain, were diagnosed a dissociative disorder according to ICD- 10 in 80, 0 % of the cases studied. 42, 6 % of them had accompanying <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain.</b> In 38, 5 % the pain was not included by the diagnosis, since it is excluded in the ICD- 10.

40|$|Background: International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as {{annoying}} sensations {{and emotions}} associated with actual or potential tissue damage or {{is described as}} such damage. Pains always {{are considered to be}} subjective sensations with multidimensional nature composed from physical, emotional and cognitive components. One of the main tasks in pain syndrome effective therapy is the option to perform objective assessment of pain intensity and quality utilizing principle of continuity. Independent surveys on pain management in postoperative period are performed in different countries of the world. Studies analyze effectiveness of both - medical and non-medical measurements in order to reduce pain syndrome. Very few investigations of chronic and acute pain influence on recovery process, progress and outcome of illness, assessment of pain intensity and quality are performed in Latvia. In the case of acute pain chronification, pain perception and management can be changed; pains become inadequately long lasting and may combine with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pains.</b> According to the data obtained by the World Health Organization, fifty percent patients after injuries or operations have severe and insufferable pains despite the development of acute pain treatment and care. Insufficiently controlled postoperative pains become a risk factor for development of various abnormalities. Aim of the study: To study the usage of postoperative period pain intensity and quality assessment scales in the clinical practice of nursing, as well as availability of these methodsMaterial and methods: Survey utilizes quantitative research method. As an investigation tool was chosen questionnaire. Survey was carried out in the surgical profile wards in Riga and regional clinics of Latvia. Questionnaire embraced 309 nurses, working in the surgical profile. Results: Assessment of acute pains should be considered as the fifth vital sign providing more successful achievement of aims in pain care. Respondents recognize that in pain assessment pain evaluation scales are rarely used. In clinical practice prevails assessment of patient’s subjective condition. Only 5 % of nurses – respondents utilize visual analogue scale, 22 % - verbal pain scale, 16 % - numerical pain rating scale. Investigation data confirm the role of professional experience of nurse in organization of pain assessment and care work, because 98 % of respondents mention pain assessment as a constituent of nursing. Conclusions: One of the main objectives in effective therapy of pain syndrome is the possibility to perform objective assessment of pain intensity and quality. This objective should be achieved only with a help of shared team work – nurse, physician, anesthetist and other medical staff...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the frequency of}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at 30 days in patients less than 40 years of age reporting with acute chest pain in Emergency Department (ED). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Emergency Department (ED) of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi between July to December 2002. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred young patients with chest pain in whom an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed. A standardized data collection form was completed. Physical examination included initial vital signs and {{presence or absence of}} jugular venous pressure (JVP), rales, or fourth heart sound. Outcome variables were seen in the patients admitted or discharged within 30 days of reporting to the ED. RESULTS: Out of one hundred young patients in the study, 24 had an ACS. Of those, 22 (91. 66 %) were males and their mean age was 35 years. Most of these patients had cardiac risk factors on physical findings. The final diagnosis of patients consisted of 47 patients with atypical chest pain, 20 with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 16 with musculoskeletal chest <b>pain,</b> 7 with <b>psychogenic</b> chest <b>pain,</b> 4 with angina, 4 with others and 2 with gastritis. CONCLUSION: Young patients, presenting to ED with chest pain, had a greater likelihood of suffering from ACS if they were male and between 30 to 40 years of age.

40|$|Subjects and methods. One {{hundred and}} eighty-three {{patients}} with valid rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were examined {{to study the}} specific fea tures of chronic pain syndrome. The DN 4 neuropathic pain diagnostic questionnaire was used to divide all the patients into 2 groups: 1) 78 patients with the neuropathic component of pain (NCP) and 2) 105 patients without the latter. Results. A clinical neurological examination could reveal peripheral nervous system lesion in 96 % of Group 1 patients and in 4 % of Group 2 ones. The patients with NCP were ascertained to be older, they were longer ill with RA, had higher clinical, X-ray stages and functional class, as well as higher pain intensity. However, {{no differences were found}} between the two groups in the values of disease activity (DAS 28) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There was a high rate (71 %) of depressive disorders, the prevalence and degree of which in RA patients were determined by the characteristics of disease severity and did not depend on the presence of NCP.

It is a {{said to be a}} state where a person is free from oral infection and sores, tooth decay, oral and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, tooth loss, periodontal disease, and other disorders and diseases that restrict an individual from speaking, smiling, etc. and even affecting his psychological state. Orofacial pain in its comprehensive cataloging can affect up to 7 % of the people. The responsibility of early diagnosis and managing it lies on the doctors, dentists and those who belong to the minor care segment, like the oral physicians, pain physicians, and headache neurologists. Facial pain is usually chronic and similar to the other chronic pain and is commonly associated with a large number of co-morbidities and treating it would involve the treatment of associated conditions such as the anxiety, depression, and the presence of other chronic pain; which must be attended to; as a part of management. Though the majority of chronic pains are continuous, there are some that are intermittent. Most of the pain is intraoral, and among them; odontalgia and burning mouth syndrome are common; whereas many of the pain could manifest both intra and extra-orally. Among the extraoral pain, the most common are the musculoskeletal pain, in relation to the muscles of mastication, which may be associated with disc problems. Neuralgias include the trigeminal neuralgia, and the less common glossopharyngeal neuralgia, having well-defined care pathways. Trigeminal neuropathic pain may also be caused by trauma; and may be secondary to such conditions as infection, malignancies and auto-immune diseases. The condition is normally managed along the lines of other neuropathic pain; by using the commonly used drugs besides the psychological support. If the type of pain cannot be categorized as occurring due to any specific cause, then a diagnosis of insistent or chronic idiopathic facial pain is made and the treatment given, may include a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Low {{back pain}} {{have become an}} urgent problem recently. Four out of five people already have or will {{experience}} backaches during their life span, for 10 % of them this pain will become chronic. Due to its great spread and treatment, health institutions experience dramatic losses for backache diagnostics and morbidity. Together with financial losses related to patient incapacity to work, his/her care, sickness benefits, etc. the expenditure becomes enormous. Thus back pain are no longer considered a medical or a social problem, but it is regarded a complex bio- psycho-social issue in today’s community. The medical part of this issue remains very important. Solving the back pain problem, significant is the knowledge of fundamental neuro- and skeleton anatomy, pain neurophysiology and neurochemistry; in the clinical practice closely related are the basics of neurology, pain medicine, orthopedics, rehabilitation and other disciplines. Consequently, it is not simple for a medicine practitioner {{to find the right}} diagnostic direction or to choose the right treatment. The most complicated issues in the back pain clinical practice are neurological syndromes (neuropathic, neurogenic). These are related with nerve structure back radicular, dorsal ganglion or the damage of nerve branches. These syndromes make up to 10 % of all backaches and are generally called radicular pain syndromes. There often emerges hyper-diagnostics or sometimes the syndromes are ignored completely. The treatment of neurological syndromes is peculiar, yet the tendency to apply general treatment of backaches is often noticed. In the last decade, the theoretical and practical pain recognition developed dramatically, however, the scientific data has not yet reached every patient. Neuropathic pain is such pain which is initiated or triggered by primal peripheral or central nervous system lesion or dysfunction. Neuropathic pain {{is one of the main}} disablement causes, concomitant with such neurological diseases as neuropathy, myolopathy, sclerosis or stroke. As stated by the European Federation of Neurologists Association, pain is a complex sensation strongly influenced by cognitive functions. Therefore, it is necessary for a neurologist as a future pain specialist to understand the function and dysfunction of nocicepsy in accordance with the notion and knowledge of pain, provided by contemporary medicine. Neuropathic pain is the most common neurological syndrome thus the neurologists should actively participate in diagnosing and treating it. Supposedly, there are 6 - 7. 5 % inhabitants in every country diseased with neuropathic pain syndrome. The major part is constituted by lumbar-sacral radiculopathy that results from inter-vertebral disc degeneration. They are accompanied by pain. Radiculopathy is considered a syndrome with a complex inherent to a radicle damage, accompanied by sensory and/or motor and/or autonomic deficiency or dysfunction. Radicular pain is often (but not necessarily) accompanied by radiculopathy, but quite frequently usual clinical testing is not sufficiently sensible to diagnose radiculopathy. No definite epidemiological data on the spread of radicle pain has been presented so far. According to a group of authors, however, it is possible to assume that 1 to 40 % of adults may get caught by the syndrome. In 1987, Heliovaara et al carried a research, according to which, 5. 1 % men and 3. 7 % women above 30 can be diagnosed with lumbar-sacral inter-vertebral disc syndrome, one of the symptoms being radiculopathy. In Finland, the incapacity to work dependent of the age of patients, triggered by radicle leg syndrome equals 14 %. In the classification of 10 diseases in TLK, radicular leg syndrome is encoded under M 51. 1, M 51. 2 and G 55. 1, but not M 54. 5 that does not show the ache of lower back. According to the research that was carried in 2000, 2863 (27. 7 %) of all 10331 patients diagnosed with lumbar-sacral inter-vertebral disc syndrome were hospitalized in 6 Kaunas’ hospitals. Radicular syndrome was diagnosed to 2158 (75. 38 %) patients. Mixter&Barr adopted his attitude in 1934, according to which, radicular pain and other neurological symptoms may be cured after inter-vertebral disc hernia surgery. However, the attitude towards radicular pain etiology has changed a lot in the recent decade. In 1990, Boden et al declared that asymptomatic disc hernia is found in magnetic resonance, it was later proofed by other authors. In 1997, Ohnmeiss announced research results, in which it was stated that 25 % of patients without disc hernia with only electrical inter-vertebral disc stimulation could feel leg pain, which could have reminded radicular pain due to its locality, since it was felt below the knee-joint. Before that, in 1991 Kuslich et al. announced a research, where during the surgery with only local anesthesia to access the damaged disc, spinal nerve, back radicular and back longitudinal spinal band were stimulated. The results were curious in that, that visually undamaged nervous structure was not painful. Moreover, the stimulation of back longitudinal spinal band or inter-vertebral disc fibrotic band caused only local pain, which did not extend to the leg. The contrasting results of both researches have been explained as follows: different stimuli were used –exterior and interior (within the disc), whose innervation is varied, nociceptors are ingrown and their stimulation may cause radicle/reflex pain. McCarron in 1987, later Olmaker in 1993 developed radicular inflammation pain theory, reasoning cytoid influence on radicle pain emergence and giving the reason to apply tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. 10 patients who suffered from refractory lumbar-sacral radiculopathy were dripped infliximab, the tumor necrosis inhibitor. After a year all of them were working in their regular positions, the pain and dysfunction eased significantly. A conclusion may be drawn, that further research is needed, where the efficiency of such treating methods would come to light. Magnetic resonance tomography results did not differ from the auditorial group patients who were given izotonic solution injection in epidural space. The genetic radicular pain etiology theory is becoming more popular these days. Besides surgical and experimental methods, for the treatment of lumbar-sacral radicular pain non-steroid medicaments, glucocorticoids more rarely, are applied. There is only one source in which the radicular leg pain is described separately from lower back pains. Applying anti-flogistic medicaments the prognosis of pain is very positive, after a month 60 % of patients were treated. Radicular pain is a complex of nocicepsic, neuropathic and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pains.</b> It is not clear why some patients continue to feel the pain for 3 months. When surgical or conservative treatment is applied distant treatment results after 5 to 10 years do not differ. It was discovered in Maine Lumbar Spine Study research that 63 % of patients are satisfied with the results of inter-vertebral disc surgery after 5 years, although 91 % got back to work. The number of satisfied patients is smaller in the non-operated group – 46 %. 56 % of non-operated patients noticed that the pain also relieved in the leg as well as in the lumbar area. More of such patients were among the operated – 70 %. It is worthwhile to mention that the operated patients felt a more intense pain and dysfunction before the surgery, therefore their pain decrease differs from non-operated. The pain disappeared to 28 % after the surgery, to 12 % without the surgery. Disability pensions were allowed to 27 % of non-operated and to 50 % of the operated patients. 19 % were repeatedly operated in the period of 5 years, 92 % of them due to disc sequester. 56 % of the operated patients and 40 % of non-operated felt recovered in the period of 10 years, 71 % of operated and 56 % of non-operated were satisfied with their current condition. 69 % reported that pre-surgical symptoms have diminished, 61 % felt much better. 25 % of all patients in both groups were operated either for the first time or repeatedly. The researchers draw the conclusions that the operated patients felt marginally better than the non-operated. It is not known exactly why after so many years the condition of some patients got better. Nevertheless, every patient should be chosen individual treatment program. Loupasis carried out a research with the patients 7 - 20 years after the surgery. The conclusions are much more emphatic since there are more unsatisfied patients in the remote periods, one fourth of them feel the persistent pain. Hard work and lower education negatively influence the results. In 1994 Hasenbring declared that the following risk factors are needed in order for the lumbar-sacral pain to become chronic: the size of disc hernia, negative psychological factors (depression, suffering with the tendency not to move, the search of social support and non-verbal pain behavior), other social factors and sedentary job. In 2001 Karppinen denied the hypothesis provided in MRT research that inter-vertebral changes are associated with pain evaluation and dysfunction. Morbidity and disablement rates related to lower backaches are increasing in Lithuania. In 2002 due to backaches 1850 people were acknowledged disability for the first time, one year after – 2064 people. 2974 applied for disability for the first time in 2002, 3390 patients applied in 2003. In 2003 439 patients were acknowledged disabled in Kaunas (116 / 100000), 185 patients in Vilnius (33. 4 / 100000), 59 / 100000 in Lithuania on the whole. In 2003, 51. 3 % of the disabled were 45 - 61 years old, 31. 9 % were among 30 - 44 years old. In conclusion it may be stated that radicular pain has its own peculiarities which are not characteristic to uncomplicated backache syndrome. In the case of such pain, neuropathic injury and concomitant pain is related to osteo-muscular system structures and possible adjacen...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{surgical}} procedures devised for intractable pain are the excision of painful {{area of the}} skin, peripheral neurotomy, intraspinal or intracranial posterior rhizotomies, anterolateral spinal cordotomy, spinothalamic tractotomy at medulla and mesencephalon for the pain of organic origin, and the prefrontal lobotomy for <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain.</b> Unfortunately, these procedures are followed either by disturbance of physiologic sensory function or by changes of affect and personality. Partial gasserian gangliolysis successfully alleviated the trigeminal neuralgia without significant sensory disturbance of the face. Recent advances in stereotaxic technique has enabled us to attack the thalamus and other deep subcortical centers. This new method, together with recent neuroanatomico-physiological progress in regard to 2 ̆ 2 pain tract 2 ̆ 2 through intralaminar nuclear complex, resulted in discovery of thalamotomy destroying the nucleus centrum medianum with or without adjacent intralaminar nuclei, which eliminates the organic pain without any detectable sensory deficit. Anterior cingulectomy or cingulumotomy has developed to alleviate the <b>psychogenic</b> <b>pain</b> without psychological changes. These are the ideal pain-relieving procedures. A new method of percutaneous cervical cordotomy can be safely used for the debilitated patients with terminal malignant diseases...|$|E
