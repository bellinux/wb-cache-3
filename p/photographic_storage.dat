40|$|The {{concept of}} density {{encoding}} digital {{data in a}} mass-storage computer peripheral is proposed. This concept requires that digital data be encoded as distinguishable density levels (DDLS) of the film {{to be used as}} the storage medium. These DDL's are then recorded on the film in relatively large pixels. Retrieval of the data would be accomplished by scanning the photographic record using a relatively small aperture. Multiplexing of the pixels is used to store data of a range greater than the number of DDL's supportable by the film in question. Although a cartographic application is used as an example for the <b>photographic</b> <b>storage</b> of data, any digital data can be stored in a like manner. When the data is inherently spatially-distributed, the aptness of the proposed scheme is even more evident. In such a case, human-readability is an advantage which can be added to those mentioned earlier: speed of acquisition, ease of implementation, and cost effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Project AFG/ 82 / 008 {{aimed to}} improve the {{planning}} and management capabilities of the Department of Forestry and Range of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reform by producing ecological and vegetation maps to allow a determination of the areas which are forested, and an analysis of present land use and land classification. Between 1966 and 1979, work toward a comprehensive vegetation resources inventory had been carried out with French bilateral assistance: its objective was to prepare an ecological map of Afghanistan at a scale of 1 : 500 000; project AFG/ 82 / 008 completed this workAt the same time, the project greatly strengthened the capability of the Department of Forestry and Range by establishing and equipping a drawing laboratory with <b>photographic</b> <b>storage</b> facilities; a photo-engraving laboratory was also set up; other map-making, photographic, and printing equipment was provided. A total of 34 national personnel were trained in various aspects of map production and cartography. Apart from the 1 : 500 000 ecological map, 92 sheets at the scale of 1 : 250 000, and 440 sheets at the scale of 1 : 100 000, were also producedIt was now recommended that, once the hand-coloured layout of the ecological and vegetation 1 : 500 000 map had been completed, the Institute of the Environment prepare the printed map in colour. It was also recommended that the Institute of the Environment establish a data bank and mapping capability, so that it may carry out its long-term responsibilities in the collection and mapping of ecological dat...|$|E

50|$|The Translator {{can trace}} its history to a June 1953 {{contract}} from the US Navy to the International Telemeter Corporation (ITC) of Los Angeles. This was not for a translation system, but a pure research and development contract for a high-performance <b>photographic</b> online <b>storage</b> medium consisting of small black rectangles embedded in a plastic disk. When the initial contract ran out, {{what was then the}} Rome Air Development Center (RADC) took up further funding in 1954 and onwards.|$|R

It also outlined the use of metadata in <b>photographic</b> images and <b>storage</b> practices for digital photos. In 2009, the second edition of The DAM Book added the use of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom to the described workflow. These books have been translated into French, German and Spanish.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{generated}} holograms (CGH) can be {{used for}} testing a widespread range of aspheric surfaces with high accuracy. Different, holographic configuration {{can be used}}; for the information <b>storage,</b> <b>photographic</b> material is very often appropriate. Two beam interferometric arrangement in which both beams pass through the CGH is desirable in order to compensate inhomogenities of the hologram storage material. For symetrlcal optical systems to be tested, in-line(Gabor-Type) and off axis CGH are applied. Although we use both configurations we prefer often off-axis arrangements The implementation of the technique requires the analysis of errors due to the testing procedurs as well as to additional optical component in the beam to be analysed and the manufacturing of the OGH. Automatic fringe analysis is very useful and will be discussed. A two wavelength technique can be used to reduce the sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|This {{short article}} {{considers}} the humble photographic mount {{as a site}} of tactile engagement. In particular, it will explore photographs that were deposited in the visual collections of public libraries as sources of local history and instruments of local identities {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. Mounts were specifically designed to present information to the eye in certain ways, and enable that information to be held in the hand and manipulated. But they also served to protect photographs against the ravages of touch in the public space. I shall consider how we might understand the enormous amount of energy expended on the consideration of photographic mounts. I consider staged materialities of the institutions that constitute these objects and their haptic requirements. These were changing radically at this period as open-access libraries organized the body of the reader in new ways. I argue that <b>photographic</b> mounts, their <b>storage,</b> access, and the arrangement of information upon them constituted part of this revolution...|$|R
