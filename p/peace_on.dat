5|$|The neutral trading {{powers were}} {{still trying to}} arrange a peace. At Elateia, Philip had met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who {{had been at the}} meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a separate <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, <b>Peace</b> <b>on</b> Earth {{met with}} mixed reviews. Some critics praised the album's {{emphasis}} on traditional Christmas songs and the worship aspect of Christmas, while others criticized the album's original songs and {{felt it was}} a disappointment in comparison to the band's previous albums. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard Christian Albums and Catalog Albums charts, number two on the Holiday Albums chart, and number fifteen on the Billboard 200. <b>Peace</b> <b>on</b> Earth has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of five hundred thousand copies in the United States.|$|E

In the last months of his life, Simeon prepared for another conflict with Constantinople despite Romanos' desperate pleas for peace.|$|E

5|$|Philip was {{now able}} {{to turn to the}} Illyrians, who were still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). He held an {{assembly}} of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> the basis of the status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E

After a long illness, Theobald died in 1161, following which unsuccessful {{efforts were made to}} have him canonised as a saint.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E

The Ziyarat Arba'een is a prayer which is usually recited in Karbala on the day of Arba'een. It is narrated from Safwan al-Jammaal from Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shiite Imam, in which the Imam instructed him to visit Imam Husayn's mosque, and to recite a specific visitation prayer on Arba'een by which the believer should reaffirm their pledge to Husayn's ideals.

He plans to enforce <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> the galaxy {{with the aid of}} a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he's created, at the expense of the original Spock's life. The newly awakened giant Spock clone uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner), convince Keniclius that the need for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Dr. Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as the original departs with his shipmates.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Massasoit, {{numerous}} Native Americans arrived at Plymouth {{throughout the middle}} of 1621 with pledges of <b>peace.</b> <b>On</b> July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit's capital, the village of Sowams near Narragansett Bay. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the English; thus, the French were no longer welcome, though they were also frequent traders in the area. Squanto remained behind and traveled throughout the area to establish trading relations with several tribes.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was now {{forced to}} return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the {{instigation}} of Philip, Prusias I king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206BC the Aetolians sued for <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205BC, formally ending the First Macedonian War. Attalus was included as an adscriptus {{on the side of}} Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200â€“196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to <b>peace</b> <b>on</b> Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century, the central {{government}} became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the <b>Peace</b> <b>on</b> the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English, set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts {{of the region and}} forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona of 1609. From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the cess land tax.|$|E
