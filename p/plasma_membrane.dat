5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane.</b> Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> is a {{phospholipid}} bilayer membrane {{that separates}} the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane.</b> The <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E

The isolated membranes had a high ratio of sterol to phospholipid (0. 98 moles/mole) and of phospholipid to protein (0. 43 mg/mg). The <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> had very low concentrations of DNA, RNA, lipid inositol, and glycerides. Glycolipids and glycoproteins were enriched in the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> relative to their concentrations in the whole cell. The <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> were also judged to be of high purity by the absence, or very low level, of enzymatic activities considered to be indicative of other cell membranes, and by electron microscope examination. Alkaline phosphatase and 5 '-nucleotidase activities were enriched in the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> 13 -fold relative to the whole homogenate and had higher specific activities in the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> {{than in any other}} cell fractions. A Mg++ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was enriched sixfold in the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> relative to the whole homogenate. The phospholipids of the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> contained more phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine and less phosphatidylcholine than did the phospholipids of the whole cells. There were differences in the fatty acid compositions of corresponding phospholipids in the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> and whole cells but no difference in the ratios of total saturated to unsaturated fatty acids.

Endosomal subfractions contained a simpler polypeptide profile than did <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes.</b> However, a large number of glycoproteins were common to both fractions. Two endosome-specific glycoproteins, of Mr 59 000 and 38 000, were identified. Sialic acid was present at concentrations higher than in <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes.</b> The results indicate that endosomal membranes have a similar composition to <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> that probably reflects their functional interaction during endocytosis and receptor recycling...|$|R

5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane).</b> Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 entry, {{as well as}} {{entry of}} many other retroviruses, has long been {{believed}} to occur exclusively at the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane.</b> More recently, however, productive infection by pH-independent, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of HIV-1 has also been reported and was recently suggested to constitute the only route of productive entry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> within a matter of minutes.|$|E

The influence of two concentrations of drugs (10 and 20 μM) and nitroxides (0. 1 and 1 mM) {{as well as their}} combinations (a drug and a nitroxide) on membrane fluidity was investigated. The <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> of cardiomyocytes were labelled with a hydrophobic fluorescence probe 12 -AS and membrane fluidity was estimated {{on the basis of the}} fluorescence anisotropy of the probe. We found that aclarubicin and doxorubicin induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in membrane fluidity, whereas the nitroxides (PL and PD) caused its increase. Preincubation of cardiomyocytes with Pirolin entirely protected <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> of these cells against damage caused by DOX. In the same conditions no protective effect of Pirolid was observed. What is more, Pirolid in combination with DOX caused fluidisation of the <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> of cardiomyocytes.

To bind PGF 2 a, liver <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> have two types of binding sites, strong and weak ones.
