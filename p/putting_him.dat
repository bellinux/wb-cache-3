5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, on an individual level the season was to get even worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> out of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> out of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|E

5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap.

5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Callender's true success, however, was in {{the passing}} game, where he accrued 92yards, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> first among all {{receivers}} in the game.
