50|$|<b>Perfluorotributylamine</b> (PFTBA), also {{referred}} to as FC43, is a liquid with a molecular structure consisting of three butyl moieties connected to an amine center, in which the hydrogen atoms have all been replaced with fluorine. The compound is produced by the electronic industry, along with other perfluoroalkyl amines. It is used as an ingredient in Fluosol and in some Fluorinert coolant liquids.|$|E
50|$|The {{global warming}} {{potential}} of <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> (PFTBA) over a 100-year time horizon has been estimated to be approximately 7100. It {{has been used by}} the electrical industry since the mid-20th century for electronic testing and as a heat transfer agent. PFTBA has the highest radiative efficiency (relative effectiveness of greenhouse gases to restrict long-wave radiation from escaping back into space) of any molecule detected in the atmosphere to date. The researchers found an average of 0.18 parts per trillion of PFTBA in Toronto air samples, whereas carbon dioxide exists around 400 parts per million.|$|E
5000|$|Fluosol is an {{artificial}} blood which is milky in color. Its main ingredients are perfluorodecalin or <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> in Fluosol-DA and Fluosol-43 respectively, perfluorochemicals suspended in an albumin emulsion.

Fluosol serves as a dissolving medium for oxygen. In order to [...] "load" [...] sufficient amounts of oxygen into it, patients must breathe pure oxygen by mask or must be in a hyperbaric chamber. While initially promising for therapy of heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning, and sickle-cell anemia, research also indicates that Fluosol may depress the patient's immune system.|$|E

30|$|Derivatized {{metabolite}} mixtures {{were analyzed}} by a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph, 5973 mass selective detector, and 7683 series injector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Helium flow was 1  mL/min. One μL samples was injected with a split ratio of 1 : 30 and resolved on a 30  m × 0.25  mm × 0.25  μm ZB- 5 MSi column (Phenomenex, US). The temperatures for the inlet, interface, and ion source were 230 °C, 250 °, and 200 °C, respectively. After a 5 -min solvent delay at 80 °C, the oven temperature was increased at 5 °C min- 1 to 310 °C at which it was held for 6  min before dropping back to 80 °C for the next cycle. Electron impact (70  eV) mass spectra were recorded from m/z 50 to 600 at 2.69 scans sec- 1. The instrument was autotuned for mass calibration using <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> (PFTBA).|$|E
30|$|The {{essential}} oil microwave assisted {{extraction was performed}} in a Neo-Clevenger type apparatus, and its chemical composition was settled by GC-MS analysis. Gas chromatographic analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890 Series GC System gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a splitless injector for a low background with an injector liner split/splitless under a column head pressure of 12.5 psi and H 2 as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 300 °Cat 5 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. A capillary column DB 5 -MS fused-silica J&W Scientific Inc. (Krackeler Scientific, Inc., Albany, NY) (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film) was used. Detection was carried out with a 5973 mass-selective single quadrupole detector (Agilent technologies). Operation control and the data process were carried out by Agilent Technologies ChemStation software. The mass spectrometer was calibrated before use with <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> as a calibration standard.|$|E
40|$|A liver {{perfusion}} {{system was}} assembled and adapted for pulse labelling studies. The perfusion medium was prepared by emulsifying <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> and Pluronic F 68 in a CO 2 atmosphere using a sonicator. Ribosome-rich and ribosome-poor rough microsomes, smooth microsomes and Golgi membranes could be prepared from perfused livers {{with a good}} purity and recovery as from non-perfused livers. The subfractionation technique used was simple and involved slight modifications of the methods described earlier by Eriksson (1973) and Ehrenreich et al. (1973). The specific activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in microsomes and of UDP-galactosyltransferase in Golgi membranes from perfused and non-perfused livers were identical. The specific activity of glucose- 6 -phosphatase in microsomes was slightly decreased after perfusion, but the membrane permeability barrier to glucose- 6 -phosphate remained intact. The granulated microsomal fractions from perfused liver had a somewhat reduced number of membrane-bound ribosomes. The system developed proved useful in studies of the synthesis and intracellular transport of albumin. The technique should also be suitable for use in studies of membrane biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{protocol}} for establishing standard instrument conditions for measurement of product ion MS/MS spectra from parent ions produced by electron ionization is presented. Within this protocol, the ion at m/z 231 (C 5 F+ 9) from perfluorokerosene or <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> is {{selected as the}} parent ion and subjected to collision-induced dissociation. The relative intensities of product ions at m/z 69, 131, and 181 are monitored {{as a function of}} collision energy while keeping the target gas pressure constant within the range of 10 − 4 – 10 − 6 torr (measured), or a beam attenuation of approximately 30 – 70 %. The collision energy at which the ion intensities for product ions at m/z 69 and 181 are equal is defined as the calibration point at that collision gas pressure; the intensity of the ion at m/z 131 is very close to this value as well. Electron ionization MS/MS spectra taken at the calibration point using two different multiquadrupole instruments show good reproducibility for several test compounds. The high degree of similarity may aid in the establishment of a MS/MS spectral library...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{ionisation}} source {{which uses}} commercially available Carbon Nano Tube devices is demonstrated {{as a replacement}} for a filament based ionisation source in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The carbon nanotube ion source electron emission was characterised and exhibited typical emission of 30 ± 1. 7 µA with an applied voltage differential of 300 V between the carbon nanotube tips and the extraction grid. The ion source was tested for longevity and operated under a condition of continuous emission for a period of 44 hours; there was an observed reduction in emission current of 26. 5 % during operation. Spectra were generated by installing the ion source into a Finnigan Mat ITD 700 ion trap mass spectrometer; the spectra recorded showed all of the characteristic m/z peaks from m/z 69 to m/z 219. <b>Perfluorotributylamine</b> spectra were collected and averaged contiguously for a period of 48 hours with no significant signal loss or peak mass allocation shift. The low power requirements and low mass of this novel ionisation source are considered be of great value to future space missions where mass spectrometric technology will be employed...|$|E
40|$|We present temperature-dependent {{absorption}} cross sections of <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> (PFTBA). PFTBA is a fully-fluorinated liquid commonly used in electronic reliability and quality testing. PFTBA vapour {{can be considered a}} potential greenhouse gas due being radiatively active in the mid-IR spectral region and having a long atmospheric lifetime. A recent paper by Hong et al. 1 as well as comparisons with previous works for the ethylene calculationsc determined that PFTBA has the highest radiative efficiency of any compound detected in the atmosphere with a detected a mixing ratio of 0. 18 parts per trillion by volume over Toronto, ON. Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations are done using the B 3 LYP method and the 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set. The calculations have determined the optimized geometrical configuration and IR intensities and wavenumbers of the harmonic frequencies for both PFBAm (N(CF 2 CF 2 CF 2 CF 3) 3) and its congener (F 3 CN(CF 2 CF 2 CF 2 CF 3) 2). Experimental cross sections are derived from Fourier transform spectroscopy performed from 600 - 1450 cm− 1 at a resolution of 0. 02 cm− 1 for room temperature and above. These experimental results are compared to compared to previous measurements of PFTBA made at room temperature by Young 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> (PFTBA) ions/analyte molecule reaction ionization for the selective determination of tobacco pyridine alkaloids by ion trap mass spectrometry (IT-MS) is reported. The main three PFTBA ions (CF 3 +, C 3 F 5 +, and C 5 F 10 N+) are {{generated in the}} external source and then introduced into ion trap for reaction with analytes. Because {{the existence of the}} tertiary nitrogen atom in the pyridine makes it possible for PFTBA ions to react smoothly with pyridine and forms adduct ions, pyridine alkaloids in tobacco were selectively ionized and formed quasi-molecular ion [M + H]+and adduct ions, including [M + 69]+, [M + 131]+, and [M + 264]+, in IT-MS. These ions had distinct abundances and were regarded as the diagnostic ions of each tobacco pyridine alkaloid for quantitative analysis in selected-ion monitoring mode. Results show that the limit of detection is 0. 2 μg/mL, and the relative standard deviations for the seven alkaloids are in the range of 0. 71 % to 6. 8 %, and good recovery of 95. 6 % and 97. 2 %. The proposed method provides substantially greater selectivity and sensitivity compared with the conventional approach and offers an alternative approach for analysis of tobacco alkaloids...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthetic}} medium for isolated guinea pig liver perfusion, using a fluorocarbon (FC) emulsion as the oxygen-carrying agent, was evaluated for {{its capacity to}} maintain liver viability and function. A 10 % emulsion of <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> (FC 43) was dispersed by a nonionic detergent (Pluronic F 68) in a buffered electrolyte solution. The FC 43 perfusate was compared with identical media in which FC 43 was either omitted or replaced by 20 % isologous red cells. Damage to liver cells was assessed by hepatic flow rate, release of aspartate aminotransferase, and liver histology. Bile secretion, albumin synthesis, and galactose elimination capacity were used as indices of parenchymal cell function, and Kupffer cell activity was assessed by uptake of colloidal radioactive gold. All three perfusion media satisfactorily maintained liver cell viability, but the two media supplemented with a specific oxygen-carrying agent were associated with significantly superior parenchymal cell function (P was between 0. 05 and 0. 01). The performance of the FC and red cell media was not significantly different. The phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells was well sustained by all three media, but the FC medium was superior with large amounts of colloidal gold. Release of iron from hepatic parenchymal cells, with the FC medium, {{was similar to that}} reported for rat liver preparations, using a red cell perfusate...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{chemical}} composition of aerosol particles {{is essential to}} understand their formation and evolution in the atmosphere. Due to analytical limitations, however, relatively little information is available for sub- 10 nm particles. We present {{the design of a}} nano-cloud condensation nuclei counter (nano-CCNC) for measuring size-resolved hygroscopicity and inferring chemical composition of sub- 10 nm aerosol particles. We extend the use of counting efficiency spectra from a water-based condensation particle counter (CPC) and link it to the analysis of CCN activation spectra, which provides a theoretical basis for the application of a scanning supersaturation CPC (SS-CPC) as a nano-CCNC. Measurement procedures and data analysis methods are demonstrated through laboratory experiments with monodisperse particles of diameter down to 2. 5 nm, where sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sucrose and tungsten oxide can be easily discriminated by different characteristic supersaturations of water droplet formation. A near-linear relationship between hygroscopicity parameter κ and organic mass fraction is also found for sucrose-ammonium sulfate mixtures. The design {{is not limited to the}} water CPC, but also applies to CPCs with other working fluids (e. g. butanol, <b>perfluorotributylamine).</b> We suggest that a combination of SS-CPCs with multiple working fluids may provide further insight into the chemical composition of nanoparticles and the role of organic and inorganic compounds in the initial steps of atmospheric new particle formation and growth...|$|E
40|$|An {{open-ended}} {{cylindrical cell}} {{with a single}} annular trap electrode located {{at the center of}} the excitation and detection region is demonstrated for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A trapping well is created by applying a static potential to the trap electrode of polarity opposite the charge of the ion to be trapped, after which conventional dipolar excitation and detection are performed. The annular trap electrode is axially narrow to allow the creation of a potential well without excessively shielding excitation and detection. Trapping is limited to the region of homogeneous excitation at the cell centerline without the use of capacitive coupling. <b>Perfluorotributylamine</b> excitation profiles demonstrate negligible axial ejection throughout the entire excitation voltage range even at an effective centerline potential of only − 0. 009 V. High mass resolving power in the single-trap electrode cell is demonstrated by achievement of mass resolving power of 1. 45 × 106 for benzene during an experiment in which ions created in a high pressure source cubic cell are transferred to the low pressure analyzer single-trap electrode cell for detection. Such high performance is attributed to the negligible radius dependent radial electric field for ions cooled to the center of the potential well and accelerated to less than 60 % of the cell radius. An important distinction of the single-trap electrode geometry from all previous open and closed cell arrangements is exhibition of combined gated and accumulated trapping. Because there is no potential barrier, all ions penetrate into the trapping region regardless of their translational energy as in gated trapping, but additional ions may accumulate over time, as in accumulated trapping. Ions of low translational kinetic energy are demonstrated to be preferentially trapped in the single-trap electrode cell. In a further demonstration of the minimal radial electric field of the single-trap electrode cell, positive voltages can be applied to the annular trap electrode as well as the source cell trap electrode to achieve highly efficient transfer of ions between cells...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative ^(31) P-NMR and enzymatic {{analysis}} of high-energy phosphates {{were used to}} characterize an isolated perfused working rabbit heart preparation. In this model, {{the left side of}} the heart works against a physiological after-load. Two perfusates, Krebs-Henseleit saline and the perfluorocarbon emulsion FC- 43 (<b>perfluorotributylamine),</b> were evaluated in their ability to maintain cardiac function and high-energy phosphate metabolites over a period of 2 – 3 h. Adenine nucleotides ATP, ADP, phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate (P_i) were measured by ^(31) P-NMR while monitoring cardiac output and coronary flow. Intracellular pH was determined using the chemical shift of P_i. At the end of each experiment, hearts were freeze clamped and enzymatically assayed for adenine nucleotides, phosphocreatine and P_i. In every experiment, hearts perfused with FC- 43 emulsion maintained the same rate of cardiac output as hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit saline, but with half the coronary flow rate: FC- 43, 22 ± 2. 5 (n = 5), Krebs-Henseleit saline 42 ± 2. 7 (n = 6) ml/min, P < 0. 001. Hearts perfused with FC- 43 emulsion showed higher [phosphocreatine] and [ATP] measured by 31 P-NMR. For [phosphocreatine]: FC- 43 3. 2 ± 0. 7 (n = 5), Krebs-Henseleit saline 1. 7 ± 0. 2 (n = 6) μmol/g wet wt., P < 0. 01. For [ATP]: FC- 43 1. 8 ± 0. 7 (n = 5), Krebs-Henseleit saline 0. 9 ± 0. 2 (n = 6) μmol/g wet wt., P < 0. 02. [phosphocreatine] and [ATP] determined by ^(31) P-NMR values were identical within experimental error to those values obtained by enzymatic analysis. Comparing [P_i] determined by both methods, 36 % of P_i in FC- 43 -perfused hearts, and only 24 % of P_i in Krebs-Henseleit saline-perfused hearts were visible by NMR, indicating that a large proportion of P_i is bound in the intact functioning heart. Similar results were obtained for [ADP]. Using the combined techniques of ^(31) P-NMR and enzymatic assay, we have shown in this model of the isolated working rabbit heart preparation, that FC- 43 emulsion maintains significantly better function and high-energy phosphate levels than Krebs-Henseleit saline...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntimicrobial {{secondary}} metabolites from extremophiles play {{a significant}} role in the pharmacological industry due to their stable and strong activity and it is used in the treatment of microbial infections. In the present work, Halomonas salifodinae MPM-TC (M. Peter Marian-T. Citarasu) was isolated from the solar salt works in India and identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing. The secondary metabolites were extracted from H. salifodinae MPM-TC and tested for antibacterial activity against aquatic bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila isolated from infected fish/shrimp, and it effectively controlled them with more than 10 mm of zone of inhibition. The metabolites were purified through silica column chromatography and in vitro antiviral activity was performed against White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) using different fractions. Among the different tested fractions, fraction-III (F-III) was able to suppress WSSV replication. Shrimps challenged with a WSSV inoculum incubated with F-III and treated Fenneropenaeus indicus survived around twice as many as the controls. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopic (GC–MS) analysis revealed that the antiviral active fraction contains around eight compounds including <b>Perfluorotributylamine,</b> Cyclopentane, 1 -butyl- 2 -ethyl and 1, 1 ′-Biphenyl]- 3 -amine. Further the active fraction F-III was incorporated in the artificial diets at the concentration of 200 (HS 1), 400 (HS 2) and 800 (HS 3) μgkg− 1 and fed to F. indicus for 30 days. After 30 days of culture, shrimps were challenged with virulent WSSV and studied for WSSV VP 28 gene expression, biochemical, haematological and immunological changes. Surprisingly, groups treated with lower concentrations of fraction F-III (HS 1 or HS 2) significantly (P< 0. 05) suppressed the viral replication. Different levels of protein and glucose, improved total haemocyte count (THC), coagulase activity and oxyhaemocyanin level all were comparable to controls. Also, immunological parameters such as prophenol oxidase and intracellular superoxide anion production were significantly increased (F= 97. 18; P⩽ 0. 001 and F= 5. 70; P⩽ 0. 05) in the groups treated with the three test concentrations. The presence of antiviral and immunostimulant active principles in the F-III fraction effectively suppressed the WSSV load and boosted F. indicus’s immune system. This research will help to develop novel antiviral drugs from plants against aquatic important pathogens...|$|E
30|$|For GC/TOF–MS analysis, three {{samples of}} 0.8  mg of exudates or root extract were {{previously}} derivatized {{to enhance their}} volatilization. Carbonyl groups were protected by 10  μL of a solution of 20  mg/mL methoxyamine in pyridine at 30  °C for 90  min. 90 μL of MSTFA and 1 % TMCS were added for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons at 37  °C for 30  min. After derivatization, 0.5 μL samples were injected in randomized sequence into a Gerstel cold injection system (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany) and Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA) in splitless mode. The system was controlled by the LecoChromaTOF software versus 2.32 (St. Joseph, MI). A 30  m long, 0.25  mm i.d. RTX 5 Sil-MS column with 5 % diphenyl/ 95 % dimethyl polysiloxane film and additional 10 -m integrated guard column was used (Restek, Bellefonte, PA). Injection temperature was 230  °C, the interface was set to 280  °C. Helium flow was 1  mL/min. After a delay of 5  min at 50  °C, oven temperature was increased at 20  °C/min to 330  °C, 5  min isocratic, cool down to 50  °C, and additional 5  min delay, afterwards. Liners were exchanged automatically every 10 samples. A Leco Pegasus IV time-of-flight mass spectrometer was operated at a transfer line temperature of 280  °C, ion source was adjusted at 250  °C, and −[*] 70  V electron impact ionization. After 290 -s solvent delay, filament 1 was turned on and mass spectra were acquired at mass resolving power R[*]=[*] 600 from m/z 85 – 500 at 17 spectra per second and 1550  V detector voltage without turning on the mass defect option. Recording ended after 1200  s. The instrument performed auto-tuning for mass calibration using <b>perfluorotributylamine</b> before starting analysis sequences. Quantification was reported as peak height using the unique ion as default, unless a different quantification ion was manually set in the BinBase administration software Bellerophon. Metabolites were unambiguously assigned by the BinBase identifier numbers, using retention index and mass spectrum as {{the two most important}} identification criteria. All database entries in BinBase were matched against the mass spectral library of 1200 authentic metabolite spectra and the NIST 05 commercial library. A quantification report table was produced for all database entries that were positively detected in more than 50 % of the samples.

40|$|A low pressure-inductively coupled plasma (LP-ICP) {{ion source}} has been {{investigated}} {{for the production of}} atomic and molecular ions for mass spectrometry (MS). A dedicated LPICP- MS was constructed, by modifying a Hewlett Packard mass selective detector, to detect ions from the LP-ICP. The ion sampling interface and ion optics were designed using established theory and the use of a computer simulation program. <b>Perfluorotributylamine</b> was continuously introduced into the LP-ICP, via a molecular leak, and the ion sampling interface, plasma forward power, and plasma gas flow rates, were optimised. When the LP-ICP ion source was sustained at 6 W with a gas flow of 6 ml min'* helium, and iodobenzene and dibromobenzene, introduced via GC, only atomic signals for iodine and bromine were observed. Detection limits were 4 and 76 pg for iodobenzene and dibromobenzene respectively. The addition of nitrogen to a LP helium ICP increased the molecular signal for chlorobenzene, resulting in a detection limit of 2 pg. However, the addition of nitrogen did not aid the production of molecular ions of iodobenzene and dibromobenzene. When 0. 07 ml min' of isobuiane was added to the LP-ICP mass spectra similar to those obtained by an electron impact source were observed. However, on the addition of more isobutane only the molecular ions (M*) for chlorobenzene, iodobenzene and dibromobenzene were observed. The detection limits for the instrument operating in the molecular mode were 100, 140 and 229 pg for chlorobenzene, iodobenzene and dibromobenzene respectively. Langmuir probe measurements were used to asses the effect of plasma forward power and gas flow rate on the local plasma potential, ion number density, electron temperature and electron number density within the LP-ICP. The local plasma potential varied from + 50 V to - 20 V depending on the plasma conditions used. The ion and electron number densities increased with increasing plasma power, with ion number densities of approximately 10 ^ cm' ^ and electron number densities of approximately at 10 * cm ^ The effect of extra plasma gas had a less distinct affect on the plasma excited species. A plasma sustained at 6 W, 7 ml min'' helium and 1. 8 ml min'* isobutane was used to provide both quantitative and qualitative information of tetraethyllead in the standard reference friel (NBS SRM 1637 II), with. the determined value of 13. 06 ± 0. 91 being in good agreement with the certified value of 12. 9 ± 0. 07 expressed as total lead.
