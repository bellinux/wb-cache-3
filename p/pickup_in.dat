5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend {{a number of}} custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> Slayer's {{early days}} {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E

25|$|Graaff {{became a}} member of the House of Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, in 1948, the year his United Party was ousted from {{government}} by the conservative National Party, which promised to enact a de jure system of apartheid.

25|$|Washington was {{considered}} a key swing state in 1968, {{and it was the}} only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey over his Republican opponent Richard Nixon. Washington {{was considered}} a part of the 1994 Republican Revolution, and had the biggest <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the house for Republicans, who picked up seven of Washington's nine House seats. However, this dominance did not last for long as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election and two more in 1998, giving the Democrats a 5–4 majority.|$|E

Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the <b>pickup.</b> <b>In</b> February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.|$|E
25|$|Another local holiday observing {{an event}} in the American Revolutionary War is Bunker Hill Day. State workers outside Suffolk County are allowed to choose any two days off in lieu of celebrating Evacuation Day and Bunker Hill Day on the {{observance}} days. The two holidays are generally not observed by the private businesses. In Charlestown, where the Battle of Bunker Hill took place, there are week-long celebrations culminating in a road race and a parade. Some government services remain in operation, such as trash <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the City of Boston and all state Registry of Motor Vehicle offices. The MBTA runs a normal schedule but, due to special events, prohibits bicycles on the subway.|$|E
25|$|The Goldman Sachs global {{economics}} team {{released a}} follow-up report to its initial BRIC study in 2004. The report states that in BRIC nations, {{the number of}} people with an annual income over a threshold of $3,000 will double in number within three years and reach 800 million people within a decade. This predicts a massive rise {{in the size of the}} middle class in these nations. In 2025, it is calculated that {{the number of people}} in BRIC nations earning over $15,000 may reach over 200 million people. This indicates that a huge <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> demand will not be restricted to basic goods but impact higher-priced goods as well. According to the report, first China and then a decade later India will begin to dominate the world economy.|$|E

50|$|The Multiflux pickups {{were the}} first commercially {{available}} pickups to use two humbucking <b>pickups</b> <b>in</b> one case. Dimarzio's Multibucker is a more recent take on this idea. The Multibucker has four side-by-side coils, {{as opposed to the}} Multiflux's two stacked coils. The Multiflux is a rather rare pickup, with not too many people having ordered it. It carried a higher price tag than the other <b>pickups</b> <b>in</b> the range and the switching options could become rather confusing.|$|R

25|$|In 1996 the Reading Works' {{work force}} stood at 2,450 {{including}} AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as {{it made the}} transition from AT into Lucent Technologies. The spin off of AT manufacturing units as Lucent Technologies became necessary as these units increasingly found that their prospective customers were AT competitors. The divestiture of the manufacturing units made them suppliers rather than competitors, opening up new markets to Lucent and to the Reading Works. At {{the same time it}} caused the anxiety that comes with change. On October 1, 1996, Lucent Technologies became independent of AT The Reading Works became Lucent Technologies Reading Facility. It employed 2,177 people, down considerably from 4,900 in 1985. By the end of 1997, the Reading Facility workforce had declined and remained stable at 2,000. By the end of 1998, the Reading Facility workforce had rebounded to 2,177. In 1999 a <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> Lightwave business caused expansion of both the Reading Facility and the Breinigsville plant.|$|E
500|$|Faye {{arrives at}} Holby General in the episode [...] "Into the Dark", {{requesting}} that registrars Joseph Byrne and Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) help her gain employment as a Bank Nurse.

500|$|D'Angelo {{composed}} all of {{the bass}} lines for Voodoo and sequenced them for Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, who he had met after {{being asked to do}} a duet with B.B. King at the time of Voodoos earlier sessions. Palladino was asked by D'Angelo to learn and improvise the bass arrangements on his 1961 model P bass. For [...] "The Root", [...] "Greatdayndamornin'", and [...] "Spanish Joint", guitarist Charlie Hunter simultaneously played guitar and bass sections with a custom eight-string guitar/bass combo, which had three lower bass and five upper guitar strings. It also had separate pickups for each set of strings, as well separate outputs for each <b>pickup.</b> <b>In</b> order to adjust production-wise to Hunter's intricate playing, Elevado had separate outputs from Hunter's guitar connected to a separate bass and guitar amplifier. He has said that there was enough separation to manage an adequate sound on both amplifiers, in spite of slight [...] "bleeding into each other" [...] from the pickups in close proximity to each other.|$|E
5000|$|Bill Bartolini began {{manufacturing}} magnetic <b>pickups</b> <b>in</b> 1973. He first {{focused on}} quadraphonic and hexaphonic pickups, and were branded {{under the name}} [...] "Hi-A".|$|R
50|$|However, all {{acoustic}} and semi-acoustic {{styles are}} very sensitive to audio feedback, making the design and placement of these pickups extremely critical and specialized. Some modern models are manufactured with both piezoelectric and magnetic <b>pickups.</b> <b>In</b> addition, some piezoelectric styles are active <b>pickups,</b> <b>in</b> that they incorporate a preamplifier that increases the output of the pickup to match modern amplifier inputs. More recently, solid body electric resonator guitars have appeared. These instruments incorporate one or more magnetic pickups, and are played via amplification.|$|R
5000|$|The pickups {{are usually}} {{configured}} as HSH, HSS or HH. There are Japan-Custom IBZ, USA-Custom IBZ, Infinity, Powersound, Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Acis, LoZ or EMG <b>pickups</b> <b>in</b> the RG Tremolo and Fixed series. The Prestige series typically comes equipped {{with either the}} USA and Japan IBZ series, IBZ DiMarzio <b>pickups,</b> DiMarzio <b>pickups</b> <b>in</b> different configurations (most often the [...] "Tone Zone" [...] and [...] "Air Norton"), active EMGs in several configurations, and one model comes equipped with Non-OEM Seymour Duncans. Bare Knuckle pickups are now standard on some Prestige models.|$|R
2500|$|The Les Paul Custom {{features}} gold hardware, multilayer binding {{including the}} headstock, ebony fingerboard, real mother-of-pearl inlays {{and two or}} three-pickup layout. 1950s Customs were all-mahogany, rather than the mahogany-with-maple-cap of the Goldtop. The original Customs were fitted with a P-90 <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the bridge position and an Alnico V [...] "staple" [...] <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> [...] the neck. In 1957, the Custom was fitted with Gibson's new PAF humbucker pickups, and later became available with three pickups {{instead of the usual}} two. The traditional Les Paul Custom was discontinued in 1961 and its name transferred to the custom version of the then-new Gibson SG.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{continued}} to seek technical improvements, {{although they were}} not always successful commercially. For example, in 1962 Paul was issued US Patent No. 3,018,680, for a <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> which the coil was physically attached to the strings.|$|E
2500|$|Piezo pickups {{have a high}} (capacitive) output {{impedance}}, {{and must}} be plugged into a high impedance input stage in the amplifier or a powered preamp [...] (a charge amplifier is best). This buffers the signal to avoid low frequency loss and microphonic noise <b>pickup</b> <b>in</b> the instrument cable. [...] Preamplification is often done by an external signal processor, but some electric violin body designs provide internal housing for preamp circuitry.|$|E
