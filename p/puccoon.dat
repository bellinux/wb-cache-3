40|$|FOR A FEW SHORT WEEKS each June, {{the stately}} {{flowering}} spikes of Great Plains yuccas illuminate Nebraska’s Sandhills and western plains. On each plant, spires of 20 to 60 ivory-white flowers {{emerge from a}} radiating array of needle-sharp leaves. The flowers rise above {{the rest of the}} vegetation like Roman candles freeze-framed in flight. Entire hillsides are sometimes transformed by this sudden flower display – often along with sprinklings of blue spiderworts, golden yellow hoary <b>puccoons</b> and white daisy fleabanes. After a few weeks the spectacular show is over, but for the yucca the story’s best chapter has barely begun. To reproduce, it depends entirely on a single species of moth, which in turn depends on this lone species of yucca for its own reproduction.

50|$|Chub Sandhill Natural Area Preserve is a 1066 acre Natural Area Preserve {{located in}} Sussex County, Virginia. It {{contains}} {{a group of}} low sandhills and riparian wetlands along the Nottoway River. Much of the region's original vegetation has been lost, but the preserve supports such remnants as queen's delight, golden <b>puccoon,</b> and hoary scurf-pea. Sand post oak, rare in Virginia, may {{also be found in}} the woods, as may a number of native legumes.|$|E
50|$|Sanguinaria canadensis is {{also known}} as bloodwort, redroot, red <b>puccoon,</b> and {{sometimes}} pauson. It has also been known as tetterwort, although that name is also used to refer to Chelidonium majus. Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape and have in the past been separated out as different subspecies due to these variable shapes. Currently most taxonomic treatments include these different forms in one highly variable species. In bloodroot, the juice is red and poisonous.|$|E
50|$|The Iroquois County State Wildlife Area {{is today}} {{a mosaic of}} sand dunes and wet prairie habitats. The {{juxtaposition}} of the sand and wetland has created a rolling savanna landscape of trees and grass, classified as an oak barren.

50|$|Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), {{also called}} orangeroot or yellow <b>puccoon,</b> is a {{perennial}} herb in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to southeastern Canada {{and the eastern}} United States. It may be distinguished by its thick, yellow knotted rootstock. The stem is purplish and hairy above ground and yellow below ground where it connects to the yellow rhizome. The plant bears two palmate, hairy leaves with 5-7 double-toothed lobes and single, small, inconspicuous flowers with greenish white stamens in the late spring. It bears a single berry like a large raspberry with 10-30 seeds in the summer.|$|E
50|$|Black Earth Rettenmund Prairie is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area {{featuring}} {{one of the}} {{few remaining}} dry-mesic prairies in Wisconsin, situated on a low Driftless Area knob and ridge. Despite the prairie's relatively small size, 130 native prairie plant species have been documented on the site. Many of these species are quite showy, including wood lily, shooting star, fringed <b>puccoon,</b> pasque flower, butterfly weed, and compass plant. Several rare species are also found on the site, including pomme-de-prairie, white camas, striped hairstreak, and the state-threatened species rough-stemmed false foxglove (Agalinis gattingeri) and regal fritillary.|$|E
50|$|The savanna {{has changed}} little {{from the period}} when eastern {{settlers}} first arrived south of the Kankakee River. The soil is a fine sand quartz, which covers the preserve and the areas surrounding it. It primarily occurs in the sand hills, much of the surrounding flatlands contains sand. Savannas in this region are dominated by oak trees. Oaks survive in the sands which shed water rapidly, creating drought like conditions. Throughout northwest Indiana, the oak savannas are primarily black oak and white oaks. Typical dry prairie plants include hairy <b>puccoon,</b> goat's rue, blunt-leaved milkweed, leadplant, and New Jersey tea. These are {{in addition to the}} grasses listed above.|$|E
50|$|Lithospermum incisum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by several common names, including narrowleaf stoneseed, fringed gromwell, narrowleaf <b>puccoon,</b> and plains stoneseed. It is native to much of central Canada and the United States, where it is known from many types of habitat. It is a hairy perennial herb growing from a taproot and woody caudex. It produces a cluster of stems up to about 30 centimeters long. The stems are lined with narrow, pointed leaves up to 6 centimeters long. The slender, trumpet-shaped flowers are pale to bright yellow or gold, and may approach 4 centimeters long. The corolla face is 1 to 2 centimeters wide, its lobes sometimes ruffled.|$|E
5000|$|Conrad Station Savanna is east of Conrad Savanna Nature Preserve on County Road 725 North. A {{parking lot}} and trail area {{available}} at CR 725 N and CR 250 W. Like the Nature Preserve, Conrad Station is dominated by savanna plants, including the hairy <b>puccoon,</b> cleft phlox (Phlox bifida), New Jersey tea and sand milkweed (Asclepias amplexicaulis). [...] Along the trail, prickly pear cactus {{can be found in}} the small open rises. Savanna wildlife that is most readily seen includes a variety of birds, i.e., red-head woodpeckers, turkey and quail. The glass lizard is common. Because it lives most of its life underground, it is rarely seen. [...] Conrad Station has an 1.8 mi interpretive trail with information signs. It follows old fire roads through the preserve.|$|E
50|$|This {{area was}} {{originally}} a transition zone between pine forest, hardwood forest, and oak savanna. These habitats were disrupted by logging and farming. Today {{the park is}} a mix of second-growth forest and meadow. As the river tends to overflow its banks in spring, inundation-tolerant species like silver maple and basswood dominate the floodplain. Wetlands are scattered throughout the park. Berries are prevalent along the trails, as are wild roses. Each month throughout spring and summer brings different wildflowers in bloom. Some common spring flowers include wild columbine (Aquilegia canadensis), wild geranium (Geranium maculatum), and Carolina <b>puccoon</b> (Lithospermum caroliniense). During the summer, visitors can see black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa), and rough blazing star (Liatris aspera). Fall brings its own mix of wildflowers, including many asters and goldenrods. There is also a variety of native grasses, including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans).|$|E

50|$|Navajo Indians utilize {{approximately}} 450 {{species for}} medicinal purposes, the most plant species of any native tribe. Herbs for healing ceremonies are collected by a medicine man {{accompanied by an}} apprentice. Patients can also collect these plants for treatment of minor illnesses. Once all necessary wild plants are collected, an herbal tea is made for the patient, accompanied by a short prayer. In some ceremonies, the herbal mixture causes patient vomiting to ensure bodily cleanliness. Purging can also require the patient to immerse themselves in a yucca root sud bath. Any distribution of medicinal herbs to a patient is accompanied by spiritual chanting.The Navajo people {{recognize the need for}} botanical conservation when gathering desired healing herbs. When a medicinal plant is taken, the neighboring plants of the same species receive a prayer in respect. Despite this fact, the collection of medicinal herbs has been more difficult in recent years as the result of migrating plant spores.Popular plants included in Navajo herbal medicine include Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), Wild Buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.), <b>Puccoon</b> (Lithospermum multiflorum), Cedar Bark (Cedrus deodara), Sage (Salvia spp.), Indian Paintbrush (Castilleja spp.), Juniper Ash (Juniperus spp.), and Larkspur (Delphinium spp.).|$|E

40|$|Midwest oak savanna {{communities}} are noted for their unusual plant assemblages, but these communities {{have been reduced}} by more than 98 % because of changing land uses and conversion to closed-canopy forests. We initiated an ongoing 15 -year experiment in 1988 to restore a 40 -ha black oak (Quercus velutina) savanna by applying burn treatments that historically maintained this vegetation type. Groundlayer composition changed significantly for both the burn treatment and the control, with the burn treatment exhibiting slight increases in herbs such as wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) and hairy <b>puccoon</b> (Lithospermum caroliniense), {{both of which are}} species requiring greater insolation. Burn treatments differentially affected different plant community characteristics during the 15 -year period, with some characteristics such as sapling density decreasing and other characteristics like species richness remaining comparatively unchanged. Oak overstory density was not affected by burn treatments, and reductions in oak density of 33 - 50 % are needed for consistency with presettlement savanna structure to enhance the diversity of sunny and shady microsites characteristic of oak savannas.
