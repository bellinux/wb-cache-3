40|$|The {{anatomy of}} 56 wood samples {{representing}} 11 native species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Wood structure {{is described in}} detail with emphasis on the taxonomic value of qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Features observed in most samples include: wood diffuseporous; pores solitary; perforation plates simple; vestured pits in vessel elements of Van Vliet’s type B; vascular and vasicentric tracheids; fibre tracheids with vestured pits; axial parenchyma apotracheal; rays heterogeneous type I and II; ray-vessel pitting small and rounded; chambered axial parenchyma cells with prismatic crystals enclosed by a thick lignified sheath; intracellular deposits of tanniniferous substances; starch grains hollow; no visual distinction between heartwood and sapwood. Pith flecks were occasionally present and limited gummosis of <b>pith</b> <b>fleck</b> parenchyma resulted {{in the formation of}} gum veins. Crystalliferous chains in pith flecks resemble those of the secondary phloem. The wood anatomy of the species studied largely resembles that of Eugenia {{in other parts of the}} world and is quite distinct from that of Syzygium. No single characteristic or combination of characteristics could be found to be diagnostic at species level. Features that might be useful to distinguish between some species are average pore diameter and lack of tannin in ray cells...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se caracterizar a anatomia e densidade básica da madeira de Alchornea sidifolia (tapiá-guaçu), e {{investigar}} a variação radial destas características. O material de estudo procede do lote cinco do Rodoanel trecho sul no Estado de São Paulo, onde cinco árvores foram identificadas no campo, retirando-se discos do DAP com média de 30 cm de diâmetro. As análises das amostras seguiram os métodos usualmente empregados em estudo de anatomia de madeiras. A espécie apresentou camadas de crescimento distintas; vasos solitários e múltiplos; placas de perfuração simples; parênquima axial apotraqueal em linhas; raios unisseriados, alternando células quadradas e eretas com inclusões cristalíferas e amido; fibras libriformes, não septadas e gelatinosas; canais radiais; máculas medulares; densidade básica baixa (0, 38 g cm- 3). Ocorreu aumento no sentido medula-casca apenas para o comprimento das fibras, diâmetro dos vasos e diâmetro das pontoações intervasculares, características que denotam madeira homogênea e de baixa resistência. Fibras com maiores lume estão associadas a menores valores de densidade básica. In this paper, we {{characterize the}} anatomy and basic density of wood in Alchornea sidifolia (tapiá-guaçu), and investigate the radial variation of these characteristics. Five trees were {{cut in the}} “Rodoanel” section southern in São Paulo state, were removed disks with 30 cm at breast height. Six samples {{were taken from the}} pith to bark, which were analyzed according to the usual methods in anatomy and properties of wood. The results revealed the presence of layer growth, solitary and multiples vessels; simple perforation plate; axial parenchyma in lines up three cells wide; rays exclusively uniseriate, all ray cells upright and/or square with inclusions crystals and starch; ground tissue fibers, non-septate and gelatinous; radial canals; <b>pith</b> <b>fleck</b> present; low basic density (0. 38 g cm- 3). There was an increase in the pith to bark only for the fiber length, vessel diameter and intervessel pits diameter, which features a wood homogeneous and low resistance. Fibers with higher lumen are associated with lower basic density...|$|E
50|$|In quartersawn material, {{where the}} wood is cut into boards {{with the growth}} rings roughly {{perpendicular}} to {{the face of the}} board, the medullary rays often produce beautiful figure such as silver grain, medullary spots, <b>pith</b> <b>flecks,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Betula platyphylla var. japonica. They {{mine the}} cambium of their host plant, {{creating}} slender elliptical mines. Mine traces, or <b>pith</b> <b>flecks,</b> are found {{on both sides}} of the winter ring layer, with the smaller, younger mines always on the inner side of the ring and the larger, more mature mines on the outside.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{comparison}} of the wood anatomy of Blepharocalyx salicifolius (H. B. K.) Berg (Myrtaceae) from two provenances in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. There were collected 6 samples of wood; three from “Serra do Sudeste” and the others from “Campos de Cima da Serra”. The wood anatomical features did not express relevant differences between provenances, {{with the exception of}} <b>pith</b> <b>flecks.</b> With respect to the quantitative features, on the other hand, there were found important differences in the structure of vessels, axial parenchyma, rays and fibres. For the “Serra do Sudeste” samples, there were found xeric evidences in the wood: a larger number of small vessels, besides shorter vessel members and fibres, in comparison with those from the “Campos de Cima da Serra” region. The differences in the wood anatomy may be interpreted as adaptative responses to environmental conditions. </p...|$|R
