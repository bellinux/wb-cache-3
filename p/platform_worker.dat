5000|$|Most episodes {{featured}} no {{more than}} two or three actors, with Chappell taking the first person voice in all but a handful of episodes (with the closing describing him as [...] "the man who spoke to you"), usually telling the tale via flashbacks. Dunning writes that [...] "Cooper's pet hate was of 'acting' and he wanted story related with a deadpan sense of here's how it happened.'" [...] Chappell usually took a conversational tone, relating the stories slowly and casually; he frequently played a specialist worker, giving Cooper a chance to add background details from his own earlier jobs as a soldier, gandy dancer or oil <b>platform</b> <b>worker.</b> Though supporting players were sparse, a group of New York radio veterans were heard on a frequent basis: as female characters, in male bit parts, or as the supernatural or otherworldly beings the ordinary Chappell character encounters. Most notably, radio star Claudia Morgan (longtime voice of Nora Charles on The Adventures of the Thin Man, and not coincidentally, Ernest Chappell's wife) was an occasional female lead, usually in tragic romances, and was heard in the final show (the appropriately titled [...] "Quiet, Please," [...] a meditation on war and peace). In one lost show, [...] "Three Sides to a Story," [...] Morgan's father Ralph Morgan was also a guest. J. Pat O'Malley, later a familiar TV character actor, was another frequent voice, heard in more than a dozen shows throughout the run, beginning with the first broadcast [...] "Nothing Behind the Door." [...] He played foreman Ted in [...] "The Thing on the Fourbleboard" [...] and was often used in parts requiring Irish or Scottish accents.

Firstly, the concept of safety is defined and the different regulations of this relationship are shown, without going further into the issue. Following, it is described how the system watch over the activity of different External Suppliers through the Aircraft Marshalling Team and, the different supervisions that are done. After that, the widespread opinion of <b>platform</b> <b>workers</b> is presented, where some of the workers decide to leave aside the security first concept to make the flight in time. Then, all the system explained above is analyzed. This analysis find out that the Airport Safety Level is acceptable but, there are certain deficiencies. The following deficiencies are highlighted: Safety is not punitive, the Safety Management System is excessively bureaucratic, the staff training process and the level of awareness of the <b>platform</b> <b>workers</b> is not ideal. Finally, some proposals are developed. These proposals seek to solve the deficiencies detected. The main proposals are highlighted for its ease in the implementation and for their improvement in efficiency. The outstanding proposals are: digitize all documentation of the Management System speeding up the paperwork adding digital signature, do not to tell the External Suppliers which flight will be the chosen one for turnaround supervision until moments before, do multiple turnaround supervisions at different suppliers at the same time and, {{the creation of a new}} formation supervision for <b>platform</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the platform economy in Europe has sparked debate on the challenges it raises for workers, companies, social partners, governments and other stakeholders, and how these challenges can be addressed. This paper assesses government responses to the platform economy in seven EU countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Spain. It shows that, owing {{to the lack of}} a specific framework governing the platform economy, countries generally attempt to apply existing legislation, regulations and policies to the new challenges that the platform economy brings. This holds for the status of workers, working conditions, and industrial relations and social dialogue. Nevertheless, this strategy is not necessarily successful. The status of <b>platform</b> <b>workers,</b> for example, remains unclear in most member states. Some member states consider all <b>platform</b> <b>workers</b> to be self-employed, while in other member states, their status is much more dependent on the specific circumstances. There seems to be little debate on the idea of introducing a new status in the countries studied. On working conditions, the results confirm that most countries have applied the existing framework to platform work. In many of the member states, this {{has turned out to be}} problematic in several dimensions (e. g. taxation and social protection). In the area of industrial relations and social dialogue, there is much less evidence of specific actions or initiatives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the platform economy, industrial relations and social dialogue, as portrayed in the literature. It provides strong evidence that <b>workers</b> in the <b>platform</b> economy are organising into new employee associations (unions) and are also being brought into existing employees associations. None of the evidence surveyed indicates that platforms are organising into employer associations or being incorporated into existing employer associations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that actors in the platform economy are engaging in tripartite dialogue. The authors conclude that i) no overarching framework exists for governing or facilitating social dialogue between the parties involved in the platform economy, and ii) even if the existing framework is applied to parties in the platform economy, it offers a poor fit due to differences between <b>platform</b> <b>workers</b> and employees, and platforms and employers...|$|R

30|$|A threat {{protocol}} {{to safeguard the}} oil <b>platform</b> <b>workers</b> and the natural environment is instituted {{so that when the}} outer circle is breached by ice, the steps of a shutdown and evacuation sequence are initiated. We consider a three-level threat model. When ice is outside the outer concentric circle, a threat level of zero exists. When ice breaches the outermost circle, the FPSO makes ready for sea, incurring a modest cost in fuel burned. If the ice leaves the outermost circle again, this step can be reversed. If, on the other hand, ice continues to breach the second circle, the FPSO must shut down oil production, at a much heavier cost. Even ignoring any petroleum engineering consequences, the result is to defer production of oil from the present {{to the end of the}} reservoir’s life. This incurs a known cost of 100, 000 x today’s oil price, with a countervailing benefit of 100, 000 x the oil price 10 [*]years from now, discounted to the present day at an appropriate interest rate (spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR). If we assume that today’s oil price is US$ 70 per barrel, discounted at 6 %, and that the value of oil grows simply with a 2 % inflation rate, the cost of deferring a day’s production is about $ 2.25 million. Naturally, this result is very sensitive to the underlying oil price assumptions.|$|R

40|$|Government {{regulation}} and licensing of industrial activities that create {{the possibility of}} catastrophic risk reflect “a political value judgment that these activities provide a social benefit that {{is greater than the}} social cost of the risks that they cause. ” However, when a catastrophic accident occurs, the cost-benefit evaluations underlying the value judgment that authorized the activity may need to be rethought. Social rethinking is especially warranted when the accident could have been prevented had either the industry or the government more seriously assessed the risk of a catastrophic event and implemented precautionary steps to avoid it. This was the conclusion reached by the President 2 ̆ 7 s Oil Spill Commission with respect to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident in April 2010, which killed eleven <b>platform</b> <b>workers,</b> injured seventeen more, discharged nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, devastated the area 2 ̆ 7 s economy and * 65 environment, and to date has cost {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} to clean up.
