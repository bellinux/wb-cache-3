Certainly, thejnanciaI {{implications for the}} insurance industry of losses of this magnitude would be severe; even industry losses much smaller in magnitude could cause financial di$iculties for insurers who are heavily exposed {{to the risk of}} catastrophe losses, The yuantiJication of exposures to catastrophes and the estimation of expected and <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>losses</b> on these exposures pose problems for actuaries.

40|$|Abstract: Worldwide, {{flooding}} {{is probably}} the number one cause of losses from natural events. No region {{in the world is}} safe from being flooded. As the flood risk {{is a function of the}} flood hazard, the exposed values and their vulnerability, the increase in flood losses must be attributed to changes in each of these aspects. While flood protection measures may reduce the frequency of inundation losses, appro-priate preparedness measures lessen the residual financial risk considerably. Besides public and pri-vate measures, insurance is a key factor in reducing the financial risk for individuals, enterprises, and even whole societies. In recent years, the demand for flood insurance has been growing. This is forcing the insurance industry to develop appropriate solutions. At the same time it is vital for the insurers to know the <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>losses</b> they might face as the result of an extreme event...|$|R

Other entities, recognizing the need to limit seismic risk while remaining competitive also adopted “PML” policies which were less defined. The lack of a precise definition has resulted in confusion in the industry and lack of any “standards”.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies on}} the {{avalanche}} risk in alpine settlements suggested a strong dependency {{of the development of}} risk on variations in damage potential. Based on these findings, analyses on <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>losses</b> in avalanche-prone areas of the municipality of Davos (CH) were used as an indicator for the long-term development of values at risk. Even if the results were subject to significant uncertainties, they underlined the dependency of today's risk on the historical development of land-use: Small changes in the lateral extent of endangered areas had a considerable impact on the exposure of values. In a second step, temporal variations in damage potential between 1950 and 2000 were compared in two different study areas representing typical alpine socio-economic development patterns: Davos (CH) and Galtür (A). The resulting trends were found to be similar; the damage potential increased significantly in number and value. Thus, the development of natural risk in settlements can for a major part be attributed to long-term shifts in damage potential...|$|R

The type of hurricane risk considered varies with the user and can be an economic risk, {{as in the case}} of the insurance and banking industries, a wind exceedance risk, a flood risk, etc. The most common uses for hurricane hazard models today include: (i) Simulation of wind speed and direction data for use with wind tunnel test data for the estimation of wind loads vs. return period for design of structural systems and cladding (ii) Estimation of design wind speeds for use in buildings codes and standards (iii) Coastal hazard risk modeling (storm surge elevations and wave heights vs. return period) (iv) Insurance <b>loss</b> estimation (<b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>losses,</b> average annual losses) This paper presents a brief overview of the history of the modeling process, concentrating on the modeling of the wind, as it is the key input to each of the examples presented above.

50|$|<b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Loss</b> (PML) is a {{term used}} in the {{insurance}} industry as well as Commercial Real Estate. Although the definition is not consistent in the insurance industry, it is generally defined as {{the value of the}} largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features (e.g. firewalls, nonflammable materials, flood defences etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (e.g. sprinklers). This loss estimate is always less than (or in rare cases, equal to) the Maximum Foreseeable Loss, which assumes the failure of all active protective features. Underwriting decisions can be influenced by PML evaluations, and the amount of reinsurance ceded on a risk can be predicated on the PML valuation.|$|E

The GDDRM model represents a milestone in the IDP field because it makes possible a first quantification of displacement risk due to disasters and explicitly considers and integrates the IDP dimension into the disaster risk management field. At the same time, the GDDRM has provided evidence that suggests that displacement associated with disasters will follow a similar increasing trend to the one observed until now (IDMC 2017).|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} disaster risk from a macroeconomic perspective. The proposed Disaster Deficit Index (DDI) represents risk from a macroeconomic and financial perspective in case of possible catastrophic events.

The DDI captures {{the relationship between the}} demand for contingent resources to cover the <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>loss</b> and the public sector’s economic resilience; that is, the availability of internal and external funds for restoring affected inventories. This paper presents the model of the DDI and the results of its application to seventeen countries of the Americas.
