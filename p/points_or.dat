The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which could be used to increase the speed or strength of their characters, recover health <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> make aiming easier.|$|E
5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S.

They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger <b>points</b> <b>or</b> tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients.

Although the Crusaders won all eleven of their round-robin matches, six of them were won by a margin of seven <b>points</b> <b>or</b> less. Their eleven round-robin games also included a record 96–19 win over the Waratahs in the final match of the round-robin stage, which was especially noteworthy given that both teams finished {{at the top of the}} table.|$|E

The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E

It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and Wayne Gretzky, who scored 200 <b>points</b> <b>or</b> more four times, {{including}} a current league-record 215 in 1985–86. Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981–82 also remains a league record. No other player in NHL history has scored 200 points, although Mario Lemieux came close in 1988–89 with 199.|$|E

As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E
5|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{features}} team-based and deathmatch-based multiplayer modes {{on various}} maps. Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player {{has reached a}} predefined number of <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> the allotted time expires {{in which case the}} team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode is activated {{in which there is no}} re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.|$|E

Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E

Hairdresser Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) was often hinted at being gay.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit <b>points</b> <b>or</b> purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
