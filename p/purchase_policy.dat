50|$|The school lays {{emphasis}} on respect for environment. The holistic education {{that is being}} attempted at the school requires developing sensitivity in the children to everything around. The nature preserved in the campus provides a veritable background to nurture such sensitivity. With natural growth keenly preserved over decades, the campus represents Varanasi in its original pristine state. Over 80 species of birds inhabit the campus apart from several species of animals, reptiles and insects. The atmosphere provides space for children to engage in introspection and solitary walks. Energy conservation is a major theme in the campus. We have installed a 100 KVA solar plant that produces almost 100% of day time power requirements {{for most of the}} months of the year thus reducing our carbon footprint substantially. Children have benefited from the infrastructure through guided tours of the facility. Apart from it, we have continuous conversation at class and hostel level about the need to conserve energy through simple steps like switching off utilities not required, sharing resources and using less intensive alternatives. Our power demand on the utility overall has dropped by over 25% thanks to these steps. The world is awash in waste. Not learning from nature, man has condemned what he has no need for as waste. At the school, we teach children the virtue of waste as a resource through recycling at various levels. Art work consistently use recycled material like old paper, used furniture, discarded plastic and old stationery. The school <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> emphasizes reduction of plastic items and bulk purchasing. In addition, we have implemented a near zero waste segregation policy whereby 100% of waste gets collected, segregated for useful items and sent for recycling. Children participated enthusiastically in the project which has won the attention of the Municipality of Varanasi.Demonstrating the food cycle to children is important to appreciate nature’s recycling habits as well as reduce waste. The campus recycles 100% of food waste back into either food for cows or to make vermi-compost which inturn is applied to our kitchen garden that children work on. They are hence able to visualize how food creates food thereby providing life lessons on recycling. The compost is also sold to the market. We also compost the dry leaves in the campus through wet composting.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{research}} indicates that some consumers form price expectations which may impact their purchase behavior. While literature in operations research has built <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models incorporating uncertain price expectations, these models have been built for commodities. Consumers face an environment with multiple brands. In this paper, we develop a model that incorporates consumer preferences and price expectations for multiple brands as determinants of normative consumer purchase behavior. The model demonstrates how commodity <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models recognizing price uncertainty {{can be adapted to}} the study of multi-brand markets. The model is used to analyze the normative impact of changes in price promotion policies and holding costs on individual purchase behavior.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the formation of}} self-enforcing climate agreements, or stable climate coalitions, when all countries {{have the option to}} fight climate change by purchasing (the right to extract) fossil-energy deposits. First, we consider the stand-alone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> and then combine that policy with the option to tax or subsidize the supply of deposits. In either case, coalitions of any size turn out to buy deposits while the non-cooperative countries do not. In case of the standalone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> either no coalition is stable or the grand coalition is the only stable coalition. If the two-instrument policy is implemented, all countries inside and outside the coalition are better off than in case of the stand-alone deposit policy, but the conditions for stable grand coalitions are more favorable under the stand-alone deposit policy than under the two-instrument policy due to weaker free-rider incentives...|$|E

40|$|Airline ticket {{purchase}} {{timing is}} a strategic problem that requires both historical data and domain knowledge to solve consistently. Even with some historical information (often {{a feature of}} modern travel reservation web sites), {{it is difficult for}} consumers to make true cost-minimizing decisions. To address this problem, we introduce an automated agent which is able to optimize purchase timing on behalf of customers and provide performance estimates of its computed action policy based on past performance. We apply machine learning to recent ticket price quotes from many competing airlines for the target flight route. Our novelty lies in extending this using a systematic feature extraction technique incorporating elementary user-provided domain knowledge that greatly enhances the performance of machine learning algorithms. Using this technique, our agent achieves much closer to the optimal <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> than other proposed decision theoretic approaches for this domain. ...|$|E

40|$|This note {{compares the}} effect of an MBS-Treasury swap (a {{strategy}} of purchasing long-maturity agency MBS and selling long-maturity Treasury bonds) versus the Treasury twist (purchasing long-maturity Treasury bonds and selling short-maturity ones). We make two main points: 1. Purchasing long MBS brings down long MBS yields by more than would an equal sized purchase of long Treasury bonds and thus is likely to create a larger stimulus to economic activity via a larger reduction in homeowner borrowing costs 2. Purchasing Treasury bonds brings down Treasury yields, but this decrease indicates a welfare cost rather than a benefit to the economy. Thus {{it would be better}} to sell rather than purchase long-term Treasury bonds. These points lead us to conclude that a superior large-scale asset <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> for the Fed is an MBS-Treasury swap where the Fed purchases long-maturity MBS, financed by a sale of longmaturity Treasury bonds.
