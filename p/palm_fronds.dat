Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some <b>palm</b> <b>fronds,</b> but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, <b>palm</b> <b>fronds,</b> or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{produced}} more than 40 million tons a year, {{only a small portion}} of oil <b>palm</b> <b>frond</b> is used as domestic animals forage and as raw material in small-scale furniture industry, while the rest is left at the plantation floor to naturally decompose.

The objective of this research was to determine mechanical properties of <b>palm</b> <b>frond</b> Frond for Chopper Machine Designing. The research of composting conduct with two composting factor combination, namely: composting starter composition (i. e. Bokashi, vermi-compost and natural composting) and piece of frond dimension (2 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm). Sample was obtained from 5 years and 20 years palm oil trees. The average length of <b>palm</b> <b>frond</b> was 675. 89 cm, average leaflet length at the <b>palm</b> <b>frond</b> base was 103. 89 cm and average leaflet length at <b>palm</b> <b>frond</b> tip was 23. 83 cm. Maximum compression strength at the 20 years-palm frond base was 8134. 62 N and at the 5 years-palm midrib base was 4893. 52 N. Maximum force requirement for cutting palm leaf was 67. 67 N. The composting process indicates that Bokashi starter composition gives higher percentage of mass reduction on all variant of piece of frond dimension. Smaller piece of frond (2 cm) enable the composting process quicker and had a better result. Statistical analysis reveals that combination of composting factors have significant effect on C/N ratio but insignificant on NPK content...|$|R

25|$|Karaite Judaism {{defines the}} Arba`at haMinim {{somewhat}} differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (Peri `Eṣ Hadar), which {{need not be}} the Etrog (yellow Citrus fruit) demanded by Rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring the olives, that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of Nehemiah, as seen in Neḥemyah 8; (2) date <b>palm</b> <b>fronds</b> (Kappoth Temarim) instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinical Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (‘Eṣ ‘Avoth) which may be from fig, laurel and Eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) willow branches (‘Aravoth Naḥal) e.g. Maple, Oak, Yew and Butternut, {{as opposed to the}} Rabbinically dictated willow tree's boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the Arba`at haMinim to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. Sukkot); they are not made into a lulav and shaken in six directions, as is the Rabbinic practice. In the book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date <b>palm</b> <b>fronds,</b> myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction.|$|E

25|$|Another major craft {{category}} is textiles. Textiles from cotton and other fibers date to {{early in the}} pre-Hispanic period on backstrap looms. This form of weaving {{has been dominated by}} women since that time. The Spanish introduced the wide European frame loom, which is mostly used by men. Traditional clothing items such as huipils are still made on backstrap looms, while the European looms are used to produce larger and heavier items such as rugs, ponchos and blankets.

The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with <b>palm</b> <b>fronds,</b> bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food stuffs include mole, candy, tamales, local breads and other regional specialties. A glass of water and “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls {{come in the form of}} insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot.
