25|$|For sexually {{reproducing}} populations, {{studies have}} shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. <b>Passaging</b> a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals. Further studies using Dictyostelium discoideum suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to kin selection. The studies with D. discoideum showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.|$|E

40|$|<b>Passages</b> can {{be hidden}} within a text to {{circumvent}} their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information {{is of concern}} to all corporate and governmental organizations. <b>Passage</b> retrieval is well studied; we posit, however, that <b>passage</b> detection is not. <b>Passage</b> retrieval is {{the determination of the}} degree of relevance of blocks of text, namely <b>passages,</b> comprising a document. Rather than determining the relevance of a document in its entirety, <b>passage</b> retrieval determines the relevance of the individual <b>passages.</b> As such, modified traditional information retrieval techniques compare terms found in user queries with the individual <b>passages</b> to determine a similarity score for <b>passages</b> of interest. In <b>passage</b> detection, <b>passages</b> are classified into predetermined categories. More often than not, <b>passage</b> detection techniques are deployed to detect hidden paragraphs in documents. That is, to hide information, documents are injected with hidden text into <b>passages.</b> Rather than matching query terms against <b>passages</b> to determine their relevance, using text mining techniques, the <b>passages</b> are classified. Those documents with hidden <b>passages</b> are defined as infected. Thus, simply stated, <b>passage</b> retrieval is the search for <b>passages</b> relevant to a user query, while <b>passage</b> detection is the classification of <b>passages.</b> That is, in <b>passage</b> detection, <b>passages</b> are labeled with one or more categories from a set of predetermined categories.

60|$|From {{the boat}} the {{business}} appeared yet more precarious {{than from the}} ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so perpetually with her plunging and <b>passaging</b> upon the anchor cable. I began to think I had made a fool's bargain, that it was merely impossible Catriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James More, if I should want to. But this was to reckon without the lass's courage.

Up she stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats, which made the enterprise more dangerous and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities. There was no minute lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the same. I stood up {{on the other side and}} spread my arms; the ship swung down on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air. I was so happy as to catch her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a fall.

60|$|On that New Year's {{morning when}} I drew up the blind {{it was still}} nearly dark, but for the faintest pink flush glancing {{out there on the}} horizon of black water. The far shore of the river's mouth was just soft dusk; and the dim trees below me were in perfect stillness. There was no lap of water. And then--I saw her, {{drifting}} in on the tide-the little ship, <b>passaging</b> below me, a happy ghost. Like no thing of this world she came, ending her flight, with sail-wings closing and her glowing lantern eyes. There was I know not what of stealthy joy about her thus creeping in to the unexpecting land. And I wished she would never pass, but go on gliding by down there for ever with her dark ropes, and her bright lanterns, and her mysterious felicity, so that I might have for ever in my heart the blessed feeling she brought me, coming like this out of that great mystery the sea. If only she need not change to solidity, but ever be this visitor from the unknown, this sacred bird, telling with her half-seen, trailing-down plume--sails the story of uncharted wonder. If only I might go on trembling, as I was, with the rapture of all I did not know and could not see, yet felt pressing against me and touching my face with its lips! To think of her at anchor in cold light was like flinging-to a door in the face of happiness. And just then she struck her bell; the faint silvery far-down sound fled away before her, and to every side, out into the utter hush, to discover echo. But nothing answered, as if fearing to break the spell of her coming, to brush with reality the dark sea dew from her sail-wings. But within me, in response, there began the song of all unknown things; the song so tenuous, so ecstatic, that seems to sweep and quiver across such thin golden strings, and like an eager dream dies too soon. The song of the secret-knowing wind that has peered through so great forests and over such wild sea; blown on so many faces, and in the jungles of the grass the song of all that the wind has seen and felt. The song of lives that I should never live; of the loves that I should never love singlng to me as though I should! And suddenly I felt that I could not bear my little ship of dreams to grow hard and grey, her bright lanterns drowned in the cold light, her dark ropes spidery and taut, her sea-wan sails all furled, and she no more en chanted; and turning away I let fall the curtain.|$|E
