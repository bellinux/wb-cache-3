A {{revision}} of river and lake typology in Bulgaria {{has been done}} within the Ecoregion No. 12 <b>Pontic</b> <b>province</b> and Ecoregion No. 7 Eastern Balkans according to the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC. Certain geographic changes between the Ecoregion No. 12 and Ecoregion No. 7 have been proposed based on existing biogeographic data, at the beginning. The whole part of the Danube and Black Sea River Basin district have been associated to the <b>Pontic</b> <b>Province</b> (ER No. 12) {{as well as the}} rest part of the Southern Bulgaria (Maritsa river basin, Mesta RB and Struma RB) has been allied to the Eastern Balkan (ER No. 7). A serious reduction {{of the total number of}} river types (from 33 to 16 types) was justified using clear hydromorphological and biological criteria, e. g. ecoregion, vertical factors (4 altitude zones, main substratum characteristics, slope, and other supplementary factors such as fish and vegetation zonation, climate maps) and horizontal factors (calcareous geology, salinity, size category). Similar reduction of the number of lake types (from 33 to 17 types) was proposed in parallel with a significant modification of the lake typology method. Lake typology in Bulgaria was based on the obligatory factors (4 altitude zones, size typology based on surface area, depth, salinity and geology) and optional factors (residence time, mixing characteristics, e. g. monomictic, dimicti...|$|E

Seven lake types wereidentified as “reservoir types”, which were only presented by heavily modified and artificial waterbodies without any possibility for natural lake equivalent within the country or region. Fourcoastal lake types with various salinity (from freshwater 40 ‰) have beenreviewed as belonging to the category “transitional waters”...|$|E
40|$|Adicella syriaca is a leptocerid caddisfly {{distributed}} throughout the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathians, the Hungarian Lowlands, the <b>Pontic</b> <b>Province,</b> and the Caucasus. This paper describes the previously unknown larva of this species, based on material from the Greek island of Corfu. Information on the morphology of the fifth larval instar is given, {{and the most important}} diagnostic features are illustrated. A key to the known larvae of the European species of Adicella McLachlan, 1877 is provided. In the context of existing identification keys, the larva of Adicella syriaca Ulmer, 1907 keys together with Adicella cremisa Malicky, 1972, but the species pair can be easily separated by the number of setae on the pro- and mesonotum, and setation patterns on abdominal dorsum IX...|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern <b>Pontic</b> <b>provinces</b> of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire {{to take advantage of the}} Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|R

5000|$|Pontic Greek is an {{endangered}} Indo-European language spoken by about 1,073,000 people worldwide. However, 200,000-300,000 are considered active speakers. [...] Although it is mainly spoken in Northern Greece, {{it is also}} spoken in Turkey, Russia, Armenia, and by the Pontic diaspora. The language was brought to Greece in the 1920s after the expulsion of the Christian Pontic Greeks from their homeland during the 1923 population exchange. However, it is still spoken in pockets of the Pontus today, mostly by Pontic Greek Muslims in the eastern districts of Trabzon <b>Province.</b> <b>Pontic</b> Greek is often considered a dialect of standard Greek, although reportedly, the speakers of each do not understand each other. It is primarily written in the Greek script, while in Turkey and Ukraine the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets respectively are used more frequently.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in a forest on the southern borders of the Central-Russian Upland, on the Prioskolsky plateau, in the Srednedonskoy subprovince of the <b>Pontic</b> steppe <b>province.</b> The aim of this work is to identify the peculiarities of structure and ways of formation of the breeding population of ravine oak forests on the border of two geographic zones. The objectives of the work were to describe quantitative and qualitative characteristics {{of the population of the}} nesting birds of ravine oak forests, as well as provide an analysis of the faunogenesic structure of the nesting bird population. To obtain data on the species composition and density of nesting birds we used the line transect method by D. Hayne – Y. Ravkin. The surveys were carried out in 2011 – 2015 three times per season (April to June). The indicators of the breeding density of each bird species and the totals for each year were calculated. The Polydominant Simpson index was used to characterize species diversity. To evaluate the uniformity we used the calibrated version of G ‘Alatalo index F’. The calculations were performed using the program PAST. In total we observed 34 species of birds over the 5 years of research. The dynamics of the total density of breeding birds in the period researched (2011 – 2015) showed a maximum in 2013 (1, 711 pairs/km 2); the average index for the 5  years was 1, 288 ± 133 pairs/km 2, which is similar to the characteristics of the populations of birds forests of the steppe zone (Donetsk Ridge, Azov Upland). The dominant and subdominant species comprised 32. 2 – 54. 7 % of the population, indicating a balanced community, in spite of the insular nature of the forest. The absolute dominant in all years was the Chaffinch (an average of 21. 2 % of the population); subdominant species were the Robin (11. 2 %), Great Tit (10. 5 %) and the Collared Flycatcher (10. 3 %). Over a third of the total number of birds are the hollow-nesting birds (37. 1 %); species nesting in the crown were 32. 3 % and ground-nesting species 25. 3 %. The geographical and genesis structure of the communities of nesting birds are characterized by predominance of species from Nemoral and Ancient-Nemoral faunal assemblage (in some years up to 90. 9 % of the population). The species from the forest-steppe faunistic complex of the European type of fauna account for 3. 6 % to 9. 48 % of the population of nesting birds, and most of these have the status of third-degree (rare species). The composition of the group of third-degree species is highly diverse: in addition to the elements of Nemoral, Ancient-Nemoral and forest-steppe complexes, it includes species from the tropical and boreal groups. Among third-degree species there is a tendency to decrease in some species from the Nemoral faunal complex with a simultaneous increase in the forest-steppe faunistic component and increase in the homogeneity of the geography-genesis structure as a whole. The significant share of the population from the Nemoral and Ancient-Nemoral species complex, which formed in deciduous forests, is evidence of the origin of the  researched ravine oak wood as a remnant of the once vast oak-forest areas...|$|R
