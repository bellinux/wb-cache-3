5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of <b>plastic</b> <b>resin,</b> such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
25|$|Fiberglass (also called glass-reinforced-plastic) is a {{composite}} material made up of glass fibers (also called fiberglass or glass friller) embedded in a <b>plastic</b> <b>resin.</b> It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibers. These fibers are woven together into a cloth and left to set in a <b>plastic</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{the cost}} of {{recyclable}} materials also exceeds {{the cost of}} raw materials. Virgin <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> costs 40 percent less than recycled resin. Additionally, a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study that tracked the price of clear glass from 15 July – 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60 while a USGS report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.|$|E
25|$|The new layout {{was started}} in 2001, is of a {{double-track}} looped-8 design; but has been built around the walls, with several reversing loops, curved laminate benchwork, more than 2000 linear feet of track, and a scale model of Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. Scenery has been built {{with a mix of}} hydrocal and extruded styrofoam board, and North Coast Engineering (NCE) Digital Command Control has been installed to allow running of multiple trains without the need for complex relay systems. The layout also features working signals that display proper occupancy, as well as scale-sized lighting fixtures for night scenes. Additionally, a new On30 narrow gauge branchline is being constructed {{at one end of the}} layout, with plans to expand it as time and resources allow. Rolling stock is owned by the individual members, with the club jointly owning the layout and control system. This rolling stock represents all periods of history, and is a mixture of brass, bronze, tin, white metal, <b>plastic,</b> <b>resin,</b> wood, paper, cardboard, and die-cast models; most of which has been extensively kitbashed/modified, features custom paint and water-slide decals; and has been weathered to better replicate real-world conditions.|$|E
500|$|The mould {{consists}} of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and the ejector mould (B plate). These components are {{also referred to as}} moulder and mouldmaker. <b>Plastic</b> <b>resin</b> enters the mould through a sprue or gate in the injection mould; the sprue bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from the barrel into the mould, also known as the [...] The sprue bushing directs the molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. [...] The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.|$|E
50|$|To help in {{identifying}} the materials in various <b>plastic</b> items, <b>resin</b> identification code numbers 1-6 have been assigned to six common kinds of recyclable <b>plastic</b> <b>resins,</b> with the number 7 indicating {{any other kind of}} plastic, whether recyclable or not. Standardized symbols are available incorporating each of these resin codes.|$|R
40|$|Plastics recyclers {{are usually}} quite {{particular}} {{about the kinds}} of plastic (i. e., which <b>plastic</b> <b>resins)</b> they will accept for processing. Reasons include: which plastics are called for in “recipes” for the products they make, how the recycling plant is set-up to handle emissions, and capabilities of the equipment at hand, as well as cost factors. It’s a plus for farmers and those involved with recycling programs to be able to differentiate among the common <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> used in agriculture so that sorting and separating can happen at the point of collection. The paper describes and interprets sink-float and burn tests used to identify common <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> and describes characteristics of the resins such as density, feel, color, strength and stretchability. These tests and observations can be carried out—even in the field—with minimal supplies.
