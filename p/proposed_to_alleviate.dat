5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>alleviate</b> traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} and continuous {{support of a}} software product at a customer with evolving requirements is a complex task for a product software vendor. There are many customers for the vendor to serve, all of whom might require their own version or variant of the application.

On top of that, these components will evolve over time to meet the changing needs of customers. <b>To</b> <b>alleviate</b> this problem we <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> <b>alleviate</b> the software release and deployment effort and reduce risks associated with it.

A predictive framework was previously introduced for mobility-aware document prefetching to enhance the experience of a mobile user roaming between heterogeneous wireless access networks.

This phenomenon is particularly acute in the heterogeneous environment. We <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> <b>alleviate</b> the system traffic load through optimizing a prefetch thresholding algorithm, accounting for server queuing prioritization.

Simulation experiments on an English-to-Pashto translation task show that the proposed strategy not only outperforms the random selection baseline, but also traditional active learning techniques based on dissimilarity to existing training data. Our approach achieves a relative improvement of 45. 9 % in BLEU over the seed baseline, while the closest competitor gained only 24. 8 % with the same number of selected sentences. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{moral hazard}} concern {{generally}} provides a rationale {{that government should}} not intervene in a financial crisis. The argument is that a market participant who expects government bailouts or emergency financing would engage in excessive risk taking.

The argument for government intervention is that flight-to-quality phenomenon {{is a result of}} insufficient risk taking generated by Knightian uncertainty.

The externality is generated when in presence of illiquid market, each firm forced to sell illiquid assets depresses prices for everyone else but does not take this effect into account in its decision-making.

Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with Rafiq Zakaria, the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women {{as an example of the}} backwardness of the community.
