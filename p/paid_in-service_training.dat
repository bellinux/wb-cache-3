40|$|Abstract Background Gender issues {{remain a}} {{neglected}} area in most approaches to health workforce policy, planning and research. There is an accumulating {{body of evidence}} on gender differences in health workers' employment patterns and pay, but inequalities in access to non-pecuniary benefits {{between men and women}} have received little attention. This study investigates empirically whether gender differences can be observed in health workers' access to non-pecuniary benefits across six low- and middle-income countries. Methods The analysis draws on cross-nationally comparable data from health facility surveys conducted in Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Jamaica, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Probit regression models are used to investigate whether female and male physicians, nurses and midwives enjoy the same access to housing allowance, <b>paid</b> vacations, <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> and other benefits, controlling for other individual and facility-level characteristics. Results While the analysis did not uncover any consistent pattern of gender imbalance in access to non-monetary benefits, some important differences were revealed. Notably, female nursing and midwifery personnel (the majority of the sample) are found significantly less likely than their male counterparts to have accessed <b>in-service</b> <b>training,</b> identified not only as an incentive to attract and retain workers but also essential for strengthening workforce quality. Conclusion This study sought to mainstream gender considerations by exploring and documenting sex differences in selected employment indicators across health labour markets. Strengthening the global evidence base {{about the extent to which}} gender is independently associated with health workforce performance requires improved generation and dissemination of sex-disaggregated data and research with particular attention to gender dimensions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: New {{research}} findings, {{changes in}} legislation {{and the use}} of information technology in nursing, require continuous <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> of psychiatric nurses to cope with, reflect on and modify their clinical practice based on emerging knowledge. Many international studies have been conducted on the importance of <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> and authors agree that <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> improves the quality of nursing care. However, few studies have been conducted on <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> in South Africa and psychiatric nursing. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to explore and describe the needs and benefits of <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> for psychiatric nurses; and to formulate recommendations for <b>in-service</b> <b>training.</b> Method: The research project followed a qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual approach. Six focus group interviews were conducted and the following questions were asked: ‘What are your <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> needs as psychiatric nurses?’, ‘What are the benefits of doing in service training?’ and ‘What can be done to ensure that <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> is done continuously?’ Data were analysed through the use of content analysis and Tesch’s eight steps of data analysis were used. Results: The findings of this research included three main themes, namely, that on-going <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> is necessary, <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> is beneficial to psychiatric nurses and that challenges exist with regard to <b>in-service</b> <b>training.</b> Conclusion: The findings confirmed the need for ongoing <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> which has many advantages for psychiatric nurses.

Many studies have been conducted on the importance of <b>in-service</b> <b>training,</b> and authors agree that <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> improves the quality of nursing care. However few studies on in-service in South Africa and psychiatric nursing science have been conducted, of which the last study conducted on psychiatric nursing science in South Africa was 1986 (Nel, 1986 : 1 - 125). Personal observations found that some psychiatric hospitals in Gauteng do not conduct <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> at all and informal discussions held with nursing managers highlighted that when <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> programmes are compiled that are poorly followed, and it is unclear what the needs of psychiatric nurses are in terms of <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> to keep them updated and empowered to perform {{to the best of their}} ability. The objectives of the study were to explore and describe the needs and benefits of <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> for psychiatric nurses in a specific psychiatric hospital in Gauteng and to formulate recommendations for <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> for psychiatric nurses in this hospital. The research project followed a qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual approach. Six focus group interviews were conducted and relevant data obtained.
