40|$|Dried {{microorganisms}} used as startercultures {{become more}} and more important for food processing and agricultural purposes. For the production of bulk-ware starter cultures, the fluidized bed drying technology was examined as an alternative process to freeze-drying yielding a product of high quality. Quality criteria for the drying process are a high survival rate of the microorganisms and little heat inactivation of intracellular enzymes. After intensive studies the fluidized bed drying of <b>pressed</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets S. Cerevisiae proved to be a suitable and economical process (1). Most of the bacteria to be dried, however, cannot be pressed into pellets without binding agents. Therefore, the drying behaviour of lactic acid bacteria sprayed onto various fluidized carrier materials was examined. Dried starter cultures produced in this way showed good mechanical flow properties and reactivation. On the other hand, the product is more hygroscopic than the pure carrier and the survival rate is o nly in the range of 20 %. Simultaneous thermal inactivation trials indicated that the low survival rate is not dependent on thermal inactivation. It can be assumed that the damage of the microorganisms depends either on the microfiltration process or on osmotic effects between carrier material and bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Up {{to within}} the present decade, no {{work had been}} done with micro 6 rganisms which produce {{comparatively}} large amounts of lactic and acetic acids from the pentose, xylose. Scattered refer-ences {{are found in the}} literature preceding 1919 to the ability of various organisms to attack xylose. Stone (1890) and others claimed that yeasts alone are unable to ferment xylose. Later workers confirmed these observations, but found that yeasts assimilate a small amount of xylose in a cul-ture medium containing this pentose. On the other hand, the production of lactic acid from xylose by the bacteria in <b>pressed</b> <b>yeast</b> was demonstrated. According to Went (1901) molds do not ferment xylose. Malenkowitsch (1906) studied the action in rotting wood of the molds Merilius lacrymans and Conophora cerebella and was unable to show that they attack xylan. Grimbert (1896) discovered that the pneumobacillus of Fried-lander converts xylose into alcohol, acetic and succinic acids, and a trace of lactic acid. Bendix (1900) reported the occurrence of xylose-fermenting bacteria in the feces of man and cows. Ac-cording to Salkowski (1900), ordinary protein-decomposing bacteria in a rich nitrogenous medium decompose xylose with the production of the volatile acid, acetic, and the non-volatile acid, succinic. The same worker investigated the behavior of xylose and arabinose when added to putrefying meat, and found tha...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the fermentation behavior of selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in banana pulp {{and they were}} compared with commercial yeast (baker’s yeast) for subsequent production of distilled spirits. Five types of microorganisms were used: Four yeast strains obtained from accredited microbiology laboratories were isolated from domestic cachaça distilleries (UNICAMP-V 1, UFMG-A 905, UFMG-A 1007 and UFMG-A 1240) and commercial <b>pressed</b> <b>yeast</b> (COMMERCIAL-yeast). The fermentation parameters of the studied S. cerevisiae strains were significantly different. COMMERCIAL-yeast and UNICAMP-V 1 strain presented higher ethanol yield and better yeast efficiency in converting total reducing sugars (TRS) into alcohol, with ethanol yields of 83. 07 and 94. 06 %, and yeast efficiency of 90. 75 and 96. 41 %, respectively for UNICAMP V 1 and COMMERCIAL-yeast. The higher alcohol contents of 82. 26 and 78. 05 mg/ 100 ml anhydrous alcohol were obtained by the UNICAMP-V 1 and COMMERCIAL-yeast, respectively. No significant differences in fermentative parameters were observed between COMMERCIAL-yeast and UNICAMP-V 1 strain. The UFMG-A 1240 strain showed the lowest ethanol yield and therefore not suitable {{for the production of}} distilled spirits made of bananas, despite being useful for the production of cachaça.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} recognized that {{creatinine in urine}} is formed spontaneously from creatine in the animal body { 1). On the other hand, some authors {{pointed out that the}} amount of creatinine in urine is closely related to the carbohydrate metabolism in the animal body. For ex-ample, in the case of diabetes, excretion of creatine in urine occurs to-gether with the decline of carbohydrate metabolism (2). The creatinu-ria owing to the starvation can be recovered by the administration of carbohydrate, but neither protein nor fat proves to be effective (if). The problem of the correlation between carbohydrate metabolism and the creatinine formation from creatine in yeast cells was studied by T. S o d a and K. S h i m o k a t a, who showed that the conversion in question occurred only when sugars were fermented by yeast cells (4), The authors investigated this problem once again and more pre-cisely. It was found that the creatinine formation was very small under aerobic condition compared with that under anaerobic condition when baker's yeast was used. Under aerobic condition, the fermentation was suppressed due to the P a s t e u r effect, and the creatinine formation may have been reduced. As the creatinine formation was completely in-hibited by NaN 3, phosphorylation may as well participate in this process. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS • In this experiment, baker's <b>press</b> <b>yeast</b> (Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd,) and Heischmann's dry yeast were used.
