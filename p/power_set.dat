5|$|Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new <b>power</b> <b>set</b> he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, <b>Power</b> <b>set</b> the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E

40|$|The abort landing {{problem is}} {{considered}} {{with reference to}} flight in a vertical plane. It is assumed that, upon sensing that the aircraft is in a windshear, the pilot increases the <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> at a constant time rate until maximum <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> is reached; afterward, the <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> is held constant. The performance index being minimized is the peak value of the altitude drop; the resulting optimization problem is a minimax or Chebyshev problem of optimal control. It is found that, for strong-to-severe windshears, the optimal trajectory includes three branches: a descending flight branch followed by a nearly horizontal flight branch, followed by an ascending flight branch after the aircraft has passed through the shear region. The peak altitude drop depends on the windshear intensity, the initial altitude, and the <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> rate; it increases as the windshear intensity increases and the initial altitude increases, and it decreases as the <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> rate increases...|$|R

5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political <b>power</b> <b>set</b> the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

30|$|The {{understanding}} of tissue damage by laser radiation {{is very important}} for the safety in the application of surgical lasers. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate cutting, vaporization and coagulation properties of the 2  µm Tm:YAG laser (LISA Laser Products OHG, GER) in comparison to the 2.1  µm Ho:YAG laser (Coherent Medical Group, USA) at different laser power settings in an in vitro model of freshly harvested porcine kidneys. Laser radiation of both laser generators was delivered by using a laser fiber with an optical core diameter of 550  µm (RigiFib, LISA Laser GER). Freshly harvested porcine kidneys were used as tissue model. Experiments were either performed in ambient air or in aqueous saline. The Tm:YAG laser was adjusted to 5  W for low and 120  W for the high <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b> The Ho:YAG laser was adjusted to 0.5  J and 10  Hz (5  W average power) for low <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> and to 2.0  J and 40  Hz (80  W average power) for high <b>power</b> <b>setting,</b> accordingly. The specimens of the cutting experiments were fixed in 4  % formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with Toluidin blue. The laser damage zone was measured under microscope as the main evaluation criteria. Laser damage zone consists of an outer coagulation zone plus a further necrotic zone. In the ambient air experiments the laser damage zone for the low <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> was 745  ±  119  µm for the Tm:YAG and 614  ±  187  µm for the Ho:YAG laser. On the high <b>power</b> <b>setting,</b> the damage zone was 760  ±  167  µm for Tm:YAG and 715  ±  142  µm for Ho:YAG. The incision depth in ambient air on the low <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> was 346  ±  199  µm for Tm:YAG, 118  ±  119  µm for Ho:YAG. On the high <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> incision depth was 5083  ±  144  µm (Tm:YAG) and 1126  ±  383  µm (Ho:YAG) respectively. In the saline solution experiments, the laser damage zone was 550  ±  137  µm (Tm:YAG) versus 447  ±  65  µm (Ho:YAG), on the low <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> and 653  ±  137  µm (Tm:YAG) versus 677  ±  134  µm (Ho:YAG) on the high <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b> Incision depth was 1214  ±  888  µm for Ho:YAG whereas Tm:YAG did not cut tissue at 5  W in saline solution. On the high <b>power</b> <b>setting,</b> the incision depth was 4050  ±  1058  µm for Tm:YAG and 4083  ±  520  µm for Ho:YAG. Both lasers create similar laser damage zones of < 1  mm in ambient air and in saline solution. These in vitro experiments correspond well with in vivo experiments. Thereby, Tm:YAG offers a cutting performance, coagulation and safety profile similar to the standard Ho:YAG lasers in urological surgery.|$|R

On the high <b>power</b> <b>setting,</b> the Tm:YAG laser was set to the maximum power of 120  W of the Revolix generator. The Ho:YAG laser was set to 2.0  J pulse energy with a 40  Hz repetition rate multiplying to 80  W average laser power which represents the maximum of the VersaPulse Select generator.|$|R
