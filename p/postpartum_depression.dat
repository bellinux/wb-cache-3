5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably <b>postpartum</b> <b>depression,</b> to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

This study aims {{to assess the impact of}} <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> on children’s mental development on all sub-scales in a Pakistani population. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two peri-urban communities of Karachi, a mega city of Pakistan, to assess the impact of <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> on children’s growth and mental development. A total of 420 women were enrolled, who had given consent out of 651 pregnant women identified, during February 2004 to December 2005. Data for socio-demographic, home environment and family relationship variables were collected between 36 weeks of pregnancy and within 10 days of childbirth. Mother’s levels of anxiety and depression were assessed at 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of childbirth. An indigenous, validated screening instrument- Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression scale was used and diagnostic confirmation was done through a psychologist’s interview, based on DSM IV criteria. Children’s growth and development was monitored in the same sequence using an Early Childhood Development tool that consists of five subscales; socio emotional, language, cognitive, gross motor and fine motor development. Physical growth was monitored by measuring height and weight of the child. Data was analyzed using SAS 9. 2. Multivariable Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) logistic regression was conducted to identify association of <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> with each early childhood development indicator, adjusting for parental and child factors. Results A significant association of <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> with delayed development on all five subscales of children’s mental development was found in our study. Interestingly, our study found that higher maternal age had adverse effects on child’s emotional whereas positive impact on child’s cognitive development. Children’s stunting had an adverse impact on all five subscales of children’s development. Male children were at higher risk for delayed language and gross motor development relative to female children. Conclusions Our study found that <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> is associated with adverse outcomes regarding children’s mental development on all sub-scales. The impact was accentuated by low family income or child’s increasing age...|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia, {{autism and}} {{depression}} do not inherit by Mendel's law, {{and the search}} for a genetic basis seems unsuccessful. Schizophrenia and autism relate to low birth weight and pregnancy complications, which are associated with developmental adaptations by "programming". Epigenetics might constitute the basis of programming and depend on folate status and one-carbon metabolism in general. Early folate status of patients with schizophrenia might be compromised as suggested by (i) coinciding incidences of schizophrenia and neural tube defects (NTDs) in the Dutch hunger winter, (ii) coinciding seasonal fluctuations in birth of patients with schizophrenia and NTDs, (iii) higher schizophrenia incidence in immigrants and (iv) higher incidence in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C -> T homozygotes. Recent studies in schizophrenia and autism point at epigenctic silencing of critical genes or chromosomal loci. The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), arachidonic acid (AA, from meat) and docosahexacnoic acid (fish) are components of brain phospholipids and modulators of signal transduction and gene expression. Patients with schizophrenia and, possibly, autism exhibit abnormal phospholipid metabolism that might cause local AA depletion and impaired eicosanoid-mediated signal transduction. National fish intakes relate inversely with major and <b>postpartum</b> <b>depressions.</b> Five out of six randomized controlled trials with eicosapentaenoic acid (fish) have shown positive effects in schizophrenia, and 4 of 6 were favorable in depression and bipolar disorders. We conclude that folate and LCPUFA might be important in both the etiology and severity of at least some psychiatric diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 148 women who visited our hospital for postpartum check-up on the 2 nd week or 6 th week after delivery were selected. We researched postpartum care methods using a questionnaire and had the women self-evaluate their <b>postpartum</b> symptoms. <b>Depression</b> was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: The average points of the 27 postpartum symptoms was 2. 70 points (from 1  = very good to 5  = very bad). Seventy-two women had depression. Factors related to <b>postpartum</b> symptoms and <b>depression</b> were smoking before pregnancy, low marital satisfaction, bad mood during and after pregnancy, lack of support from husbands, and bad quality of sleep during puerperium. Treating the joints of hands carefully when milking breasts, and avoiding squatting down, demonstrated a negative correlation with the average points of postpartum symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that mood during puerperium and Beck Depression Inventory points were significant factors related to the average points of postpartum symptoms and that the degree of support from husbands and mood during pregnancy were statistically related with depression.

40|$|Abstract Background Neonatal {{anxiety and}} {{depression}} and breastfeeding cessation are significant public health problems. There is an association between maternal symptoms of {{anxiety and depression}} and early breastfeeding cessation. In earlier studies, the causality of this association was interpreted both ways; symptoms of anxiety and depression prepartum significantly impacts breastfeeding, and breastfeeding cessation significantly impacts symptoms of anxiety and depression. First, we aimed to investigate whether breastfeeding cessation is related {{to an increase in}} symptoms of anxiety and depression from pregnancy to six months postpartum. Second, we also investigated whether the proposed symptom increase after breastfeeding cessation was disproportionately high for those women already suffering from high levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Methods To answer these objectives, we examined data from 42 225 women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Subjects were recruited in relation to a routine ultra-sound examination, and all pregnant women in Norway were eligible. We used data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and questionnaires both pre and post partum. Symptoms of anxiety and depression at six months postpartum were predicted in a linear regression analysis by WHO-categories of breastfeeding, symptoms of anxiety and depression prepartum (standardized score), and interaction terms between breastfeeding categories and prepartum symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results were adjusted for cesarean sections, primiparity, plural births, preterm births, and maternal smoking. Results First, prepartum levels of anxiety and depression were related to breastfeeding cessation (β 0. 24; 95 % CI 0. 21 - 0. 28), and breastfeeding cessation was predictive of an increase in <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> (β 0. 11; 95 %CI 0. 09 - 0. 14). Second, prepartum anxiety and depression interacted with the relation between breastfeeding cessation and <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> (β 0. 04; 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 06). The associations could not be accounted for by the adjusting variables. Conclusions Breastfeeding cessation is a risk factor for increased anxiety and depression. Women with high levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy who stop breastfeeding early are at an additional multiplicative risk for <b>postpartum</b> anxiety and <b>depression.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Postpartum blues, <b>postpartum</b> {{neurotic}} <b>depression</b> and puerperal psychoses have distinct clinical features; {{they affect}} women in all social classes {{and in all}} cultures, and despite numerous studies {{they have not been}} linked definitively with any biologic or psychosocial variables. The only possible exception is puerperal psychosis, which emerges much more often in women with a personal or family history of a bipolar affective disorder than in women without, a finding that probably explains the reluctance of some researchers to recognize puerperal psychotic episodes as distinct from psychotic episodes at other times. If postpartum blues last longer than 2 weeks and are disabling they are classified as neurotic depression and warrant treatment, often requiring both psychosocial approaches and psychotropic drug therapy. Antidepressants, major tranquillizers, electroconvulsive therapy and lithium have proved effective in the treatment of postpartum psychoses, depending on the symptoms. Both lithium and diazepam have been reported to cause deleterious side effects on breast-fed infants, and as the side effects of other psychotropic drugs given to a nursing mother are imperfectly understood, bottle feeding seems prudent...|$|R

Bilateral ECT was more effective than unilateral, and high-dose was more effective than low-dose. Their conclusions were qualified: most of the trials were old and conducted on small numbers of patients; some groups (for example, elderly people, women with <b>postpartum</b> <b>depression</b> and people with treatment-resistant depression) were under-represented in the trials even though ECT is believed to be especially effective for them.|$|E

In the present study, we proposed testing a comprehensive mediation model linking parental depression, coparenting, and child symptoms.

The results showed that coparenting support mediated the links between parental depressive symptoms and child symptoms, but only for mothers: Maternal depressive symptoms were linked with lower coparenting support, which in turn predicted increased psychofunctional symptoms and behavior problems assessed by mothers. Although coparenting conflict behaviors were not predicted by parents' depressive symptoms, higher conflict was unexpectedly linked with fewer behavior problems assessed by both parents.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and compare first-time mothers' <b>postpartum</b> stress, <b>depression,</b> social support, and health status over the first 6 weeks {{following}} discharge from hospital after childbirth. Four hundred and thirty-five women were enrolled from clinics and hospitals in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan. The study showed that three items-“the baby getting sick suddenly”, “the unpredictability of the baby's schedule”, and “the flabby flesh of my belly”-were consistently perceived to be among the top five postpartum stressors by women, regardless of which postpartum week it was. Most women had minimal depression with 71. 83 % in the sixth week to 81. 58 % in the first week. Women perceived a high level of social support and their greatest amount of support was from family. A range of women from 25. 71 % in the fifth week to 32. 39 % in the second week of postpartum was categorized as having minor psychiatric morbidity.
