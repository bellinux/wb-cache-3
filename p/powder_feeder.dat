40|$|Abstract. The self fluxing NiCrBSi alloys {{can produce}} coating layers {{by means of}} laser {{processing}} techniques. Main procedures are the laser post-treatment of previously thermal or plasma sprayed coats and the laser cladding, for which preplaced or continuously delivered powder (in this case aided by <b>powder</b> <b>feeders)</b> can be used. NiCrBSi alloys have an interesting property due {{to the presence of}} boron and silicon in its composition: they exhibit a relatively low melting point, making the laser cladding process easier. The layers obtained on metallic based materials are resistant to high temperature erosion wear and corrosion. However, if additional abrasive wear resistance is needed, the feeding with ceramic powders such as tungsten carbides (WC) is required. The high melting point of ceramics makes the laser cladding process complicated as the melt pool is made up of liquid metal plus not totally melted ceramic particles and the whole suffers the effect of the shielding and carrying gas flows, producing undesired instabilities. In this paper several combination of WC and NiCrBSi powders were tested. It is shown that the WC fraction in the mixture has a major influence on the obtention of pore and crack free clad layers. Bellow a certain ratio the meltpool appears to be more stable and less affected by the different gas flows used in the process, yielding dense NiCrBSi coatings with rather evenly distributed WC particles. In these conditions, the analysis and characterization of the produced coatings shows that the microstructure gains homogeneity without decreasing too much microhardness if compared with the pure ceramic layers...|$|R

In this field, advanced laser-based techniques are of outstanding {{importance for the}} related applications in mould and tool, aircraft and aerospace, as well as automotive industry. Many laser cladding solutions have been transferred into industrial series production within the last years. The motivations for the raising interest are given by the typical features of the technology: {{on the base of}} closed CAD/CAM chains, a quick and comprehensive treatment even of complex shaped and highly stressed components is possible. The heat input into the workpiece is less compared to TIG or PTA welding, although a metallurgical bonding to the substrate is guaranteed. Furthermore, the precise material deposition even at small partial areas is an advantageous characteristic. The coating materials include metal alloys (Co, Ni, Cu basis, Titanium, and steel), hard metals (e. g., WC/Co, TiC, and VC with metallic binders), and oxide ceramics (Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2).

40|$|Directed Light Fabrication (DLF) is {{a process}} invented at Los Alamos National Laboratory {{that can be used}} to fuse any metal powder {{directly}} to a fully dense, near-net shape component with full structural integrity. A solid model design of a desired component is first developed on a computer work station. A motion path, produced from the solid model definition, is translated to actual machine commands through a post-processor, specific to the deposition equipment. The DLF process uses a multi-axis positioning system to move the laser focal zone over the part cross section defined by the part boundaries and desired layer thickness. Metal powders, delivered in an argon stream, enter the focal zone where they melt and continuously form a molten pool of material that moves with the laser focal spot. Position and movement of the spot is controlled through the post-processor. Successive cross-sectional layers are added by advancing the spot one layer thickness beyond the previous layer until the entire part is deposited. The system has 4 <b>powder</b> <b>feeders</b> attached for co-deposition of multiple materials to create alloys at the focal zone or form dissimilar metal joint combinations by changing powder composition from one material to another.

40|$|Improved small-particle powders and powder-processing {{conditions}} {{have been developed}} for use in plasma spray deposition of thermal-barrier and environmental barrier coatings. Heretofore, plasma-sprayed coatings have typically ranged in thickness from 125 to 1, 800 micrometers. As explained below, the improved powders make it possible to ensure complete coverage of substrates at unprecedently small thicknesses of the order of 25 micrometers. Plasma spraying involves feeding a powder into a hot, high-velocity plasma jet. The individual powder particles melt in the plasma jet as they are propelled towards a substrate, upon which they splat to build up a coating. In some cases, multiple coating layers are required. The size range of the powder particles necessarily dictates the minimum thickness of a coating layer needed to obtain uniform or complete coverage. Heretofore, powder particle sizes have typically ranged from 40 to 70 micrometers; as a result, the minimum thickness of a coating layer for complete coverage has been about 75 micrometers. In some applications, thinner coatings or thinner coating layers are desirable. In principle, one can reduce the minimum complete-coverage thickness of a layer by using smaller powder particles. However, until now, when powder particle sizes have been reduced, the powders have exhibited a tendency to cake, clogging <b>powder</b> <b>feeder</b> mechanisms and feed lines. Hence, the main problem is one of synthesizing smaller-particle powders having desirable flow properties. The problem is solved by use of a process that begins with a spray-drying subprocess to produce spherical powder particles having diameters of less than 30 micrometers.

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of paddle speeds and fill depth at different tableting speeds on the weight and weight variability of tablets. Materials and methods: Two excipients possessing different flow behavior, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP), were selected as model powders.

Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of wall surface roughness, particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of screw feeder geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (powder quantity in hopper and wall surface roughness). For these experiments, rotation of the screw feeder was fixed at 236 rpm. By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the screw feeder. The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by wall surface roughness and particle size. Effect of powder quantity in hopper can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the screw feeder, it is not by helicoidal surface of the screw <b>feeder.</b> <b>Powders</b> trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing screw feeder diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron).
