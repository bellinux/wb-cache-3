50|$|Para{{formaldehyde}} forms {{slowly in}} aqueous formaldehyde solutions {{as a white}} precipitate, especially if stored in the cold. Formalin actually contains very little monomeric formaldehyde; most of it forms short chains of <b>polyformaldehyde.</b> A small amount of methanol is often added as a stabilizer to limit the extent of polymerization.|$|E
50|$|Polyoxymethylene (POM), {{also known}} as acetal, {{polyacetal}} and <b>polyformaldehyde,</b> is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability. As with many other synthetic polymers, it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as Delrin, Celcon, Ramtal, Duracon, Kepital and Hostaform.|$|E

Several techniques are employed {{in order to get the}} exact structural conformation and structural parameters of molecules. Present paper discusses some of the available techniques such as Fourier Infra-Red Spectrocopy, Raman Spectroscopy and Theoretical Structure simulation which are employed in this technologically important field.

Even the structural pattern of the molecule gets altered due to replacement of Hydrogenatoms by Fluorine atoms. Structural pattern recognition in case of molecules is an important task {{in the field of}} bioengineering. Theoretical structure simulation is also employed in this technologically important field.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of preignition, ignition, and combustion characteristics of Delrin (acetate terminated <b>polyformaldehyde)</b> and Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) resins in air and oxygen are presented. The determination of ignition limits and {{their dependence on}} temperature and the oxidizing media, {{as well as the}} analyses of the volatiles produced, were studied. Tests were conducted in argon, an inert medium in which only purely pyrolytic reactions can take place, using the stagnation burner arrangement designed and constructed for this purpose. A theoretical treatment of the ignition and combination phenomena was devised. In the case of Delrin the ignition and ignition delays are apparently independent of the gas (air, oxygen) temperatures. The results indicate that hydrogen is the ignition triggering agent. Teflon ignition limits were established in oxygen only...|$|E
40|$|The Master thesis {{deals with}} the {{possible}} production of the plastic unit with thread. As the most suitable material was chosen the <b>polyformaldehyde</b> (POM), its production label is Delrin 500 P NC 010 by Du Pont. The thesis consists of a part with {{the information about the}} technology of injection molding of plastics and a part where processing parameters for the production of the plastic unit are designed. Part of the solution was to create an assembly design of injection mold. Since the plastic unit with thread is very specificly shaped the form is handled as a slide mold. The mold is pieced together from normalized parts by the Hasco and DME company. The serie of 100 000 pieces would be delivered in 5 months. Because of the cost savings a solution of the cold-runner system was suggested. A suitable injection molding machine was chosen from the calculated values from Arburgfroms â€“ Type 370 s Allrounder 500 - 170. At the end of the thesis costs were evalueted for acquire per one piece of adapter...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the effect}} of {{formaldehyde}} on microorganisms and body had become a global public health issue. The multistage combination of anaerobic and aerobic process was adopted to treat paraformaldehyde wastewater. Microbial community structure in different reaction stages was analyzed through high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that multistage A-O activated sludge process positively influenced <b>polyformaldehyde</b> wastewater. The removal rates of formaldehyde were basically stable at more than 99 % and those of COD were about 89 %. Analysis of the microbial diversity index indicated that the microbial diversity of the reactor was high, and the treatment effect was good. Moreover, microbial community had certain similarity in the same system. Microbial communities in different units also showed typical representative characteristics affected by working conditions and influent concentrations. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant fungal genera in the phylum level of community composition. As to family and genus levels, Peptostreptococcaceae was distributed at various stages and the dominant in this system. This bacterium also {{played an important role}} in organic matter removal, particularly decomposition of the acidified middle metabolites. In addition, Rhodobacteraceae and Rhodocyclaceae were the formaldehyde-degrading bacteria found in the reactor...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{vibration}} on different engineering thermoplastic (Polyurethane Polyamide, <b>Polyformaldehyde)</b> and Constructional steel gear materials has been studied. The major parameters used in the research are the depth of cut and spindle speed. The depth of cut is varied while the spindle speed is kept constant for every gear material. The depth of cut used in this experiment are (0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00) mm. The cutting tool vibrations are measured by using measured using Piezoelectric Accelerometer model KB 12 and recorded for the four spindle speeds (360, 720, 1080, 1440) rev/min for the various gear materials of the feed box. The graphs are plotted between the cutting tool vibrations along y-coordinate and spindle speed along x-coordinate for different gear materials along with constructional steel gear as a reference. The result showed that Vibration of the cutting tool increases as the depth of cut increases either with Thermoplastic gear or Constructional Steel Iron gear, vibrations produced during machining operations are higher in Constructional steel gears than the thermoplastic gears. The purpose and significance {{of this research is}} to see how vibrations produced by varying depth of cuts using different gear materials affect the accuracy and dimensional stability of machined surfaces. This paper is limited to varying depth of cut and constant spindle speed for every gear material. Further research should be carried out keeping the depth of cut constant and the spindle speed varied...|$|E
40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether varicocele (VC) in rats can cause Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS). Material/Methods: Forty adolescent SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: 4 -weeks control group, 4 -weeks experimental group, 12 -weeks control group, and 12 -weeks experimental group. Left varicocele models were introduced by partially ligating left kidney veins for the experimental groups, and the sham surgery groups as controls were executed with exactly the same surgery as in the experimental groups except for the ligation. Rats in control and experimental groups for 4 and 12 weeks were killed after laparotomy at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, the testes were taken out and fixed in fixative containing 4 % <b>polyformaldehyde,</b> then were stained by hematoxy-lin and eosin (HE). The density and viability of sperm were analyzed by computer-aided sperm analysis. Results: Compared with rats in 4 -weeks and 12 -weeks control group, histological structures of bilateral testes in both experimental groups were impaired, most of them showing as focal focuses. The pathological changes of tes-tes in rats of the 12 -weeks experimental group were bilateral, and included atrophy of seminiferous tubules, turbulence of spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules, defluvium of most spermatogenic cells, abortion of spermatogenesis, and degradation of spermatogenic epithelia. One rat in the 12 -weeks experimental group was shown having SCOS, with the spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules completely flaked, degraded...|$|E
