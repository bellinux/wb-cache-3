50|$|It {{is often}} {{referred}} to not as an opera, but as a serenata, a type of dramatic cantata. The appearance of a quartet of lovers (Aminta and Elisa, Agenore and Tamiri) of somewhat dubious fidelity automatically puts a modern audience in mind of Così fan tutte. The principal <b>psychological</b> <b>theme</b> of the opera is, however, the demands of love against the demands of kingship, as Aminta, the shepherd-king, tussles with his conscience, and in this Il re pastore is closer in theme to Idomeneo than any other of Mozart's operas. Indeed, Idomeneo was the next completed opera that Mozart wrote after Il re pastore, after his six-year-long break from the stage. Furthermore, the theme of qualities for kingship appears in another opera, La clemenza di Tito, his last one.|$|E

[...] Sharp also notes that voyeurism is a common theme in the pink film, {{and that it would}} be deeply explored in the later films of director Hisayasu Satō. Not only a <b>psychological</b> <b>theme,</b> voyeurism also provided a practical way for the director to obscure sexual organs, which were censored by law. Sharp writes, [...] "Framing the sex scenes from an awkward nozoki point-of-view perspective, through keyholes, gaps in open doors, holes in walls, etc, proved one particularly expedient method of blocking the action." ...|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: Remember Me brings {{together}} contributors {{from around the}} world with unique insight on the ways in which one's relationship with loved ones continues, endures, and perhaps even grows after death. Much of the available literature speaks of healthy bereavement as letting go of the deceased and moving forward with life. This new text challenges that notion, discussing the meaning attributed to death and to the anticipation of death. The living, as presented in these innovative chapters, construct social entities of those who have died, via the carrying out of wishes in the Will; pursuing legal claims; or simply attributing certain desires, emotions, or choices to the deceased reconstitutes them as active, even vital, voices even after biological death. Just as life itself, the end of life and death is an interdisciplinary matter. A clear <b>psychological</b> <b>theme</b> and focus ties together these perspectives under three conceptual areas: the anticipation of death; the social life of the deceased and the legal embodiment of the deceased...|$|E
40|$|A thesis submittedThe {{role of a}} {{psychologist}} within bariatric services is predominately focussed on the completion of preoperative psychological assessments (NICE, 2006; Ratcliffe et al, 2014). This role requires the psychologist to determine the suitability of the patient for surgery (Bauchowitz et al., 2005; Fabricatore et al., 2006; Sogg & Mori, 2004; UK Faculty of clinical health psychology; Psychologists in weight management network meeting, 2013), however no research to date {{has been able to}} reliably determine which variables could be associated with sub optimal weight loss (Sarwer, Wadden, & Fabricatore, 2005; Van Hout, Verschure, and van Heck, 2005; Wadden, Sarwer, Fabricatore, 2007). The first part of this study examines the empirical evidence for a range of variables considered by professionals to be clear contraindications to surgery. The variables were collated from surveys conducted in America (Bauchowitz et al., 2005; Fabricatore et al., 2006). Due to conflicting evidence and various problems with the studies it is difficult for a clinician to draw any firm conclusions from the review. Therefore, an ideographic approach is suggested, which leads onto {{the second part of the}} researcher dossier. The empirical chapter presents an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of interviews with 14 bariatric participants who were 12 months to three years post-operative to explore their experience of - 21 surgery. This time frame was chosen to capture the participants after the ‘honeymoon phase’ when the participants have hit their weight plateau (Yale & Weiler, 1991; Brolin, 1992). The themes from the study were ‘pre op’ ‘phases’ weight maintenance’ ‘impact of the operation’ and an overall <b>psychological</b> <b>theme</b> of ‘locus of control’. Support was a key area for the participants, they described the lack of support they felt from professionals and means of seeking support elsewhere. The themes also highlighted the psychological struggle the participants go through post operatively with eating, however, this is balanced with the positive changes in identity and their ability to engage with life, no longer impeded by their weight. Recommendations from the study suggest the importance of psychologists being available to bariatric patients, in accordance with NICE guidance, and that all bariatric patients start their journey to surgery in a level three service (which is a weight management service with consists of a multi-disciplinary team) before being referred to the tier four surgical team. Finally weight loss prior to surgery is recommended, with an alternative method of achieving this than that presented in the recent British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (2014) publication...|$|E
40|$|Interpersonal {{violence}} {{is a matter of}} growing concern. Where the safety of the common man is concerned, the dangerousness of mental patients, the ongoing de-institutionalization within psychiatry, and the role of alcohol is disputed. In order to analyze the significance of abuse and mental disorder in violent behaviour, this subject was approached from two different perspectives; from a specific violent offence - homicide - examining the mental status of the offenders, and from individuals with a specific mental disorder - schizophrenia -and assessing the rate of criminal offence amongst them. Homicides in northern Sweden and in Stockholm, legally characterized as murder, manslaughter or assault and causing another’s death, and homicides followed by the offenders’ suicide, were studied. Medicolegal autopsy records, police reports, pretrial psychiatric reports and court records were collected and scrutinized. The criminal records of 644 persons, discharged from hospitals in Stockholm with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, were studied. The relative risk of criminal offence was analyzed by indirect standardization using the general population as a standard. Violent offenders were further examined from psychiatric records. In the homicide material, 16 females and 160 males killed 94 men, 78 women, and 15 children. Forty percent of all surviving offenders were abusers without a major mental disorder, 39 % were mentally disordered, 11 % committed suicide, and 10 % were considered "normal". The abusers and their victims were older, often socially and mentally deteriorated, and well known to each other. The victim was the prime aggressor in half of the cases. Killings by mentally disordered persons and by those who committed suicide were characterized by intimacy between offender and victim; one third were also abusers. Multiple homicides and child murder were mainly seen among homicide-suicice cases. The "normal" offenders were more often of foreign origin and two thirds of the victims initiated the violence by physical attacks. Relatively more of the homicides in northern Sweden concerned intimate parties, use of firearms, and cases of homicide-suicide, as compared to homicides in Stockholm where drug abuse was more prevalent. Sixteen offenders (9 %) in the homicide sample had schizophrenia (all males), while 38 subjects (6 %) in the cohort of schizophrenics had committed a violent offence. No homicide was recorded and most of the offences were of minor severity. The rate of violent offence was four times higher in the study group as compared to the general population. Most homicides involved closely related persons with separation and dependence as the dominating <b>psychological</b> <b>theme,</b> especially in homicide- suicide cases. Intoxication was regularly seen among the abusers but not among the non-abusers. The acute effect of alcohol intoxication may be of lesser importance in violence as compared to the long-term effects of abuse. Schizophrenics do not impress as a particularly dangerous group. Prevention by psychiatry is difficult; most offenders did not have any contact with psychiatry prior to the act. S. 1 - 70 : sammanfattning, s. 71 - 176 : 5 uppsatser digitalisering@um...|$|E
