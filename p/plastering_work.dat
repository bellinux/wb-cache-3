Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and <b>plastering</b> <b>work.</b> The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed.|$|E
500|$|Now, {{remnants}} of the city lie scattered in Begumpur village, as a mute reminder of its ancient glory. The Begumpur Mosque, a vestige of the old city, of overall layout plan of [...] size with the inner courtyard measuring , {{is said to be}} patterned on an Iranian design planned by the Iranian architect Zahir al-Din al-Jayush. A majestic building {{in the heart of the}} city with a pride of place played a pivotal role of serving as a madrasa, an administrative centre with the treasury and a mosque of large proportions serving as a social community hub surrounded by a market area. It has an unusual layout with three arch covered passages with a [...] "three by eight" [...] deep nine bay prayer hall on the west. Construction of this mosque is credited to two sources. One view is that it was built by Khan-i-Jahan Maqbul Tilangani, Prime Minister during Feroz Shah Tughlaq’s rule, who was also builder of six more masjids (two of them in the close vicinity). The other view is that it was built by Tughlaq because of its proximity to Bijay Mandal and could probably be dated to 1351 A.D., the year Tughlaq died here. In support of the second view, it is said that Ibn Batuta, the chronicler of the period (till his departure from Delhi in 1341 A.D.) had not recorded this monument. The Mosque considered an architectural masterpiece (see pictures in gallery) has three gates, one in each of the three covered passages, in North, East (main gate) and South directions. The west wall which has the Mihrab, has Toghluqi style tapering minarets flanking the central high opening covered by a big dome. The entire passageway of the west wall has twenty-five arched openings. The Mihrab wall depicts five projections. The prayer hall has modest decorative carvings but the columns and walls are bland. The eastern gate approach is from the road level up a flight of steps to negotiate the raised plinth on which this unique mosque has been built with a four Iwan layout. Stone chajjas or eaves can also be seen on all the four arcades. The Northern entry with [...] raised entrance, probably linked the Mosque to the Bijayamandal Palace. [...] The stucco <b>plastering</b> <b>work</b> on the mosque walls have lasted for centuries and even now show some tiles fixed on them at a few locations. The mosque was under occupation during Jahanpanah's existence till the 17th century. In the later period, encroachers had occupied the mosque but were cleared by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1921. A shuttered by lane entry from the north has been interpreted as an approach that was used by the womenfolk of the Sultan's family for attending prayers in the mosque.|$|E

I never cared two straws which way a freight train was headed... or what it was I did to keep body and soul together." [...] He lugged bricks, did <b>plastering</b> <b>work,</b> labored in a broom factory, and with a bridge-construction gang—all the while {{studying}} Thomas Paine and Robert Ingersoll, endeavoring to bolster his contempt for religion. Eventually Nash found his way back to Detroit, where, with the help of some locals, he opened a laundry, and then married Y.W.C.A. boarding school superintendent, Maude Lena Southwell, calling her his [...] "life partner." [...] Described by Nash as being [...] "possessed by a strong, robust faith," [...] under Maude's influence, Nash came to view his arguments as being not against Christianity itself, but against its misinterpretation. He reentered the ministry with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and in 1900, accepted the pastorate of a small church in Bluffton, Ohio. But Nash's rekindled career in religious work ended with [...] "bewildering suddenness," [...] when, in a funeral sermon, he extolled the many virtues of a kindhearted but professedly unreligious man, recently departed. The Disciples of Christ called for Nash's resignation forthwith.|$|E

When the line was extended to 242nd Street, the temporary platforms at 230th Street were dismantled, and were rumored to be brought to 242 Street to serve as the station's side platforms.

Sc. {{in civil}} EngineeringThe {{construction}} industry is labor-intensive and {{relies heavily on}} the skills of its workforce. The workforce is the industry’s most valuable asset, which, at the very least, accounts for {{over a quarter of}} the total project cost. The present study focuses on improving the labour productivity in order to reach an optimal performance. This has been achieved by modeling the factors influencing formwork labour productivity. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodology was utilized in this study. The qualitative research data consisted of eight in-depth interviews with contractors and project managers related to building projects. The quantitative research data was gathered {{with the aid of a}} questionnaire. Sixty questionnaires were sent to Contractors Company and site engineers and sixty five responses were received. The response rate was ninety three percent. The results of the questionnaire revealed that the most influential group on productivity is physical factors group with percentage of 78. 11 %. The in-depth interviews revealed according to experts project managers the importance of productivity rate in major and on the labors statues in the work site in Gaza strip and their performance according to their affectedness aspect such as motivation and number of staff. The contractor adds some feedback about the importance of time that has a relationship with productivity to finish the project on or before the deadline. The Analytical hierarchy process was then employed to model the most important factors affecting formwork labour productivity depending on the questionnair’s results. We recommend that management Contractor should take Job Satisfaction and Job security of formwork labour. It is recommended that there must be more awareness about lack of essential needs of labors in the site. It is recommended that the contractor should be careful when choose the number of skilled expert formwork workers.
