40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the dominant biogeochemical controls on mercury partitioning in super-permafrost groundwater at Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, Nunavut. Mercury partitioning in snow, ephemeral standing water, and super-permafrost groundwater was investigated. Results indicate that partitioning differs between matrices, and that <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> is spatially and temporally dynamic in Truelove Lowland groundwater. <b>Particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in groundwater was 73 % of total mercury, while snow had only 22 % <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury.</b> <b>Particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in groundwater rose by over 20 % from Julian day 181 to 189, and decreased slightly on Julian day 191. No single geochemical parameter was a good predictor of <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> concentrations. To expand upon the findings of the field study a laboratory microcosm study was conducted to determine whether certain biogeochemical processes influence mercury partitioning in super-permafrost groundwater. <b>Particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in the dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria inhibited microcosm was 61 % of total mercury, approximately 18 % lower than in all other treatments.

40|$|Mercury {{concentrations}} in size fractions of {{airborne particulate matter}} obtained from urban and suburban sites in Beijing in 2003 and 2004 are presented in this paper. The average concentrations of total <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> were 1. 18 +/- 0. 82 ng m(- 3) {{with a range of}} 0. 18 - 3. 51 ng m(- 3) at the urban site and 0. 68 +/- 0. 62 ng m(- 3) with a range of 0. 13 - 2. 40 ng m(- 3) at the suburban site. This is much higher than what is found in Europe and Northern America. The results implie that significant anthropogenic sources in Beijing contribute to the concentration of <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in air and therefore, to the mercury deposition in this region. There are clear seasonal variations in concentration of <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> with highest {{concentrations in}} winter at urban and suburban sites. This illustrates the important contribution from coal burning to <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> during the heating season. The mercury concentration in each size fraction of airborne particulates was closely related to its size range. The highest mercury concentration was found in the size fraction less than 1. 1 mu m with average concentrations of 0. 59 +/- 0. 50 and 0. 29 +/- 0. 26 ng m(- 3) at the urban and suburban sites, respectively. The mercury in this size fraction accounts for 45. 7 +/- 9. 5 % and 41. 9 +/- 8. 2 % of the total <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury,</b> respectively. This implies that a large fraction of the <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in this area can be transported long range before it becomes deposited. Based on the concentrations of size-fraction a ted <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> in ambient air, the dry deposition fluxes of mercury were estimated to 407 mu g m(- 2) a(- 1) at the urban site and 270 mu g m(- 2) a(- 1) at the suburban site.

50|$|An {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is {{a technology that}} uses a high pressure gasifier to turn coal and other carbon based fuels into pressurized gas—synthesis gas (syngas). It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, {{can be turned into}} re-usable byproducts through the Claus process. This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, <b>particulates,</b> <b>mercury,</b> and in some cases carbon dioxide. With additional process equipment, a water-gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide. The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle, similar to a combined cycle gas turbine. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion.|$|R

In this paper, mercury speciation for surface seawaters sampled from nine coastal sites of China was performed. Speciation analysis of total <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> (Hg-T) (P), total dissolved mercury (Hg-T) (D), monomethylmercury (MMHg) (D), dimethylmercury (DMHg) (D), mercuric ion (Hg 2 +) (D) and mercuric chlorocomplexes (HgCl 3 - and HgCl 42 -) (D) was carried out by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) after separation and preconcentration with thiol cotton fiber (TCF) and anion-exchange resin columns. The concentration of (Hg-T) (D) ranged from 25. 3 to 41. 1 ng/L. The concentration of dissolved inorganic mercury was in the range of 12. 8 - 24. 7 ng/L, which averaged 55. 9 % of the total dissolved mercury. Dissolved mercuric chlorocomplexes (HgCl 3 - and HgCl 42 -) (D) appeared to be the principal speciation, averaging 45. 7 % of total dissolved mercury. The concentration of (MMHg) (D) was higher in coastal seawaters collected in Beidaihe (2. 55 ng/L) and Huludao (2. 36 ng/L). In other costal water samples, the concentration of (MMHg) (D) ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 86 ng/L. A significant inverse correlation was observed between (MMHg) (D) and dissolved oxygen content. Labile inorganic mercury (II) was probably the most likely substrate for mercury methylation. The highest concentration of dissolved DMHg (0. 136 ng/L) was detected in seawater sampled in Xiamen. <b>Particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> constituted 51 - 90 % of the total mercury.

The average concentrations of TGM and TPM were 2. 57 ± 1. 37 ng/m 3 and 0. 32 ± 0. 10 ng/m 3, respectively. Variations in the TGM were affected by both emissions and meteorological parameters. In the heating period (February), due to coal combustion TGM concentrations were significantly higher than those in the spring (March, April and May). A clear different diurnal variation in TGM concentration was also observed both in late winter and in spring, accompanying with the advance of sunrise.

The exchangeable <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury,</b> which varies with salinity, and the mercury fraction associated with the amorphous oxyhydroxides were evaluated.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{experimental}} acidification on mercury methylation and volatilization were measured in sediment, water, and attached microbial communities (on artificial substrates) from an acid-susceptible Wisconsin lake. This research was initiated to determine potential mechanisms causing elevated mercury concentrations in biota of low pH waters. Methylation and volatilization rates were quantified by incubating samples with 203 Hg(NO 3) and measuring {{the formation of}} CH 3 203 HGplus and volatile 203 Hg species, respectively. The effects of acidification on these processes were assessed by experimental acidification of samples with either HCl or H 2 S 04. Methylation was greatest in surficial sediments (0 - 10 cm) from the profundal zone of the lake, and significantly less (p< 0. 01) in littoral and deeper sediments. The amounts of methylmercury produced in water and artificial substrate samples were very small, near the detection limit. Methylation in surficial sediments was significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased by lowering the pH with either HCl or H 2 S 04 in the pH range 6. 4 - 3. 0. Methylation in sediments acidified to pH 5. 0 did not increase during a 74 d incubation. The addition of sulfate (as Na 2 S 04) further decreased methylation in sediments acidified to pH 4. 5, but did not affect methylation in non-acidified sediments (pH 6. 4). Thus, the elevated mercury concentrations observed in biota of low pH waters are not due to enhanced methylation activity. Mercury volatilization, which was almost entirely abiotic in the present study, was greatest in water. Mercury volatilization in sediments was initially faster than methylation, but decreased sharply 20 min after addition of 203 Hg 2 plus, presumably due to the binding of <b>mercury</b> to <b>particulates.</b> <b>Mercury</b> volatilization in water was decreased by acidification, but the effect of acidification on volatilization in sediments was highly variable. The abiotic volatilization of mercury may therefore by inhibited in low pH waters, resulting in increased retention of atmospherically deposited mercury.

Mercury was found to be located predominantely in the particulate fraction throughout the year, contributing to its retention within the system. Seasonal conditions, variations in marine and fluvial signals and processes affecting bed sediment resuspension influenced the character and concentration of suspended particulate matter in the water column. Variation in the nature, levels and partitioning of organic carbon in the particulate fraction affected levels of <b>particulate</b> <b>mercury</b> as well as mercury partitioning. These results highlight the dominant role of suspended particulate matter in the distribution of anthropogenic mercury and reinforce the importance of competitive behavior related to organic carbon in mercury scavenging...|$|E
40|$|The MECAWEx model (Pirrone et al., 2005) {{has been}} tested using {{measured}} total gaseous mercury data obtained during the four Mediterranean Atmospheric Mercury Cycle System (MAMCS) project measurement campaigns performed simultaneously at five coastal sites around the Mediterranean between 1998 and 1999. The model has also been tested using Hg (g) 0, Reactive Gaseous Mercury (RGM) and Total <b>Particulate</b> <b>Mercury</b> (TPM) data from two oceanographic cruise campaigns. The model has been run for the whole 12 month period of the campaigns and thus has allowed annual deposition and emission fluxes {{to and from the}} Mediterranean Sea to be estimated. The results show that the combined wet and dry Hg deposition to the sea surface during the model run was 20. 4 tons, while the emissions were 90. 4 tons making the Mediterranean Sea a net emitter of Hg. The results allow the relative importance of wet and dry deposition pathways to be assessed over the modeling domain. The Mediterranean region as a whole is an area where the dry deposition flux of Hg almost always outweighs the wet deposition flux...|$|E
40|$|This method {{applies to}} the {{determination}} of <b>particulate</b> and gaseous <b>mercury</b> (Hg) emissions from chlor-alkali plants and other sources (as specified in the regulations), where the carrier-gas stream in the duct or stack is principally air. 1. 2 Principle. Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in acidic iodine monochloride ICl solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 2. Range and Sensitivity 2. 1 Range. After initial dilution, the range of this method is 0. 5 to 120 ug Hg/ml. The upper limit can be extended by further dilution of the sample...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{speciation}} {{in solid}} sample matrices {{has been investigated}} using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with multicollector sector field (MCSF) and quadrupole (Q) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for species specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). 199 Hg enriched methylmercurychloride has been synthesised and recovered in the solid form {{for use as a}} spike material. The stability of methylmercury during the IDMS procedure was investigated using 199 Hg and 13 C labelled methylmercury isotopomers and ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. IntermoIecuJar exchange of the methylmercury halide counter ion was observed, the halide counter ion order of preference was l>Br>Cl. No evidence was found for the decomposition, or formation, of methylmercury during equilibration with soil (NIST 2710 SRM) or dogfish muscle (DORM- 2 CRM), or during chromatographic separation. The extent of equilibration between the spike and the <b>particulate</b> bound <b>mercury</b> compounds was studied by temporal monitoring of the 200 Hg: 199 Hg isotope amount ratio and determining the amount of Hg species in the liquid phase. For N 1 ST 2710, complete equilibration was only achieved when concentrated HNO 3 in combination with a microwave digestion was employed. For DORM- 2, complete equilibration was achieved when using 1 : 1 H 2 O. CH 3 OH vǎnd 0. 01...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying mercury (Hg) {{emissions}} from active volcanoes is of peculiar interest for better constraining the global cycle and enviromental {{impact of this}} highly toxic element. Here {{we report on the}} abundance of total gaseous (TGM = Hg 0 (g) + HgII(g)) and <b>particulate</b> (Hg(p)) <b>mercury</b> in the summit gas emissions of La Soufrière andesitic volcano (Guadeloupe island, Lesser Antilles), where enhanced degassing of mixed hydrothermal-magmatic volatiles has been occurring since 1992 from the Southern summit crater. We demonstrate that Hg in volcanic plume occurs predominantly as gaseous mercury, with a mean TGM/Hg(p) mass ratio of ~ 63. TGM was also measured in condensates of fumarolic gases issuing from the South crater for assessing the volcanic Hg source strength in reference to H 2 S. On average, the TGM/Stot mass ratio in the issuing gases was found to be ~ 3, 5 times lower than in the volcanic plume (6. 3 × 10 - 7 and 2. 2 × 10 - 6, respectively), suggesting that there is no fast Hg chemical processing inside fumaroles. From the mean TGM/Stot ratio in the plume and the H 2 S plume flux, measured for the first time, we evaluate the emission rate of gaseous mercury from La Soufrière summit dome as 0. 8 kg yr- 1...|$|R
