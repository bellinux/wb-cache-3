40|$|Increased global use {{of highly}} {{productive}} breeds of farm animals has been coupled to loss of genetic diversity in most species. In European countries, various governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations try to preserve genetic diversity of livestock in situ (e. g., by stimulating {{the use of}} indigenous, rare breeds by farmers; in nature reserves; or in noncommercial farms). In the case of poultry, maintaining in situ populations of the noncommercial (fancy) breeds largely relies on hobby farmers. In addition to in situ conservation, gene banks are being established for ex situ conservation. In at least 2 countries, France and The Netherlands, there are limited collections of frozen semen of rare <b>poultry</b> <b>breeds.</b> Since 2003, the CGN has started with a more systematic effort to collect, freeze, and store semen of indigenous Dutch <b>poultry</b> <b>breeds.</b> At present, the CGN gene bank contains semen of 11 Dutch rare <b>poultry</b> <b>breeds.</b> Also, CGN has performed research on the methodology for cryopreservation of fowl semen. This recent work was focused on finding a suitable replacement for glycerol, which is contraceptive in the hen, as a cryoprotectant. For reasons of hygiene and sample identification, we favored straw freezing, {{as opposed to the}} highly effective pellet freezing method. A significant interaction was found between cooling rate and cryoprotectant concentration. Best post-thaw sperm quality was obtained when combining 0. 6 mol of dimethylacetamide/L with a cooling rate of +/- 200 degrees C/min. Inseminations, twice per week with 0. 3 billion sperm per insemination resulted in 97 and 88 % fertilized eggs with fresh and frozen semen, respectively.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} four Italian local poultry species (chicken, duck, turkey and guinea fowl) using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. AFLP molecular markers, have been an important tool to enrich existing genetic maps in plants, bacteria and less widely in animal genomes. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and AFLP analysis was carried out according to the protocol described in Barcaccia et al. 1999. Three primer combinations have been used to analyse all the samples and allowed the identification of a particular DNA fingerprinting pattern for each species that permits a clear distinction among them. A cluster analysis of the neutral and biallelic AFLP markers was performed within each species and it was possible to distinguish the different breeds. Genetic similarities of all possible pairs of genotypes within species were estimated using a Jaccard index.

Aim {{of this study was to}} explore the use of biallelic Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers in a local <b>poultry</b> <b>breed</b> reared in the Veneto region (Italy). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from 12 cocks belonging to Ermellinata di Rovigo breed. AFLP genotyping was carried out using four enzime combinations (EcoRI/TaqI, EcoRI/MseI, PstI/TaqI, PstI/MseI), following the protocol described by Barcaccia et al. 1999. Results showed that the use of MseI is not appropriate in the breed examined because it doesn’t generate polimorphic profiles, while TaqI appears more favourable. The highest number of polymorphic bands is obtained using TaqI and EcoRI, but further experimentation will be necessary to choose the appropriate endonucleases, as only one primer combination for each pair of enzimes has been tested. This study showed the applicability of AFLP markers to the characterisation of the <b>poultry</b> <b>breed</b> examined. Further tests will permit to validate a definitive experimental protocol that might be used also for other poultry breeds...|$|E
