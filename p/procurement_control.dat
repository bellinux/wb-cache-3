40|$|We {{analyze and}} compare five {{contract}} schemes {{used in a}} supply chain: fixed price (FP), cost reimbursement (CR), <b>procurement</b> <b>control</b> (PC), index-linked payment (IL), and relational (RL) contracts. From interviews, we learned that (1) FP and RL {{are the two most}} popular schemes; (2) PC is less popular, but it is used more often than CR and IL; and (3) a couple of firms are considering CR and IL and will probably use them in the future. By presenting a two-stage contracting model that incorporates a risk-neutral buyer and a risk-averse supplier under raw material price uncertainty and information asymmetry, we show that overhedging the supplier's risk with an IL contract can be optimal for the buyer in many cases. Using the model to study the effects of price trends, risk attitudes, information asymmetry, and constraints on purchase time, we find that each contract can be optimal in certain situations from certain standpoints. In particular, when a long-term relationship is considered, RL is equivalent to IL as long as the contract is self-enforcing, and RL can replace IL when no index is available. Connecting the analytical results to the interviews, we find that firms' choices and considerations can be well understood. © 2014 INFORMS. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The only remaining major government involvement is the food subsidy in some wheat products, the "baladi" bread subsidy in particular. Policy analysis studies in Egypt have been made possible because the Government of Egypt collects and publishes significant amounts of agricultural data on a regular basis. Two of the most widely used data sets are the Household Budget Survey conducted and published by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, and the Food Balance Sheet, which is derived and published by the Ministry of Agriculture. However, differences among various data sources remain and need to be harmonized. A number of studies have been conducted to estimate food supply and demand parameters (i. e., elasticities) using mostly the two previously mentioned data sets. However, the range of elasticity estimates in these studies is rather wide. For example, price elasticity estimates classify animal products in the range of inelastic to elastic with respect to price, and as necessity to luxury with respect to income. This lack of precision makes these parameters less useful for policy analysis purposes. Further investigations are needed to pinpoint the source of these differencesâ€”whether it is due to data, model specification, or estimation techniques â€”so corrective measures can be applied to improve their precision.

Based on an 11 -month program implemented at the Hanford Site, hazardous material use and waste generation was effectively reduced by using a centralized <b>procurement</b> <b>control</b> program known as HMRI. As expected, several changes to the original proposal were needed during the development/testing phase of the program to accommodate changing and actual conditions found at the Hanford Site. The current method requires a central receiving point within the Procurement Organization to review all purchase requisitions for potentially Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hazardous products. Those requisitions (approximately 4 % to 6 % of the total) are then forwarded to Pollution Prevention personnel for evaluation under HMRI. The {{first step is to}} determine if the requested item can be filled by existing or surplus material. The requisitions that cannot filled by existing or surplus material are then sorted into two groups based on applicability to the HMRI project. For example, laboratory requests for analytical reagents or standards are excluded and the purchase requisitions are returned to Procurement for normal processing because, although regulated, there is little opportunity for source reduction due to the strict protocols followed. Each item is then checked to determine if it is regulated or not. Regulated items are prioritized based on hazardous contents, quantity requested, and end use. Copies of these requisitions are made and the originals are returned to Procurement within 1 -hr. Since changes to the requisition can be made at later stages during procurement, the HMRI fulfills one of its original premises in that it does not slow the procurement process...|$|E

Those firms which have not implemented technology at the proper time are at the risk of losing customers or suppliers. Transportation industry in general and maritime transportation industry in particular are not exception in this regard. Customers, partners, agents, collaborators, shippers, port operators, suppliers and service agencies are involved in the ship transport industry supply chain, and one of the major requirements in such a supply chain in which all concerned parties are scattered all over the world, is the high speed transferring of data between them. In maritime transportation procurement process plays an essential role. Ships usually purchase a large quantity of supplies for maintaining daily operations. The procurement process in maritime industry should be organized in a way that enables efficient transfer of goods and services into vessels. Today, a major goal of a maritime’s supply chain management is to apply information technology to their procurement systems efficiently and cost effectively. Moving away from traditional and paper based offline purchase processing to online procurement enables shipping lines to gain better procurement practices in terms of cost efficiency. In this study based on the literature review, seven most frequently mentioned factors found. These performance factors were: Cost, visibility of supply chain, cycle time, <b>procurement</b> <b>control,</b> inventory management and purchasing errors which were influenced by implementing E-procurement. An attempt has been made in this research to find the performance effect of e-procurement implementation in ship management companies.

40|$|In a {{historical}} context where economic budgets continue to tighten, companies {{are facing the}} urgent necessity to contain their expenses, while ensuring, and possibly improving, the quality of services provided and the preservation of their own goods; thus, the only feasible way to achieve costs reduction is to avoid squandering resources, hence increasing operating efficiency, innovation and sustainability. In Buildings Operations and Maintenance, often {{one of the most}} expensive building-related operations, this means preventing ineffective decisions by properly capturing and using building-related information, making them standard and interoperable through the whole asset’s life. Such a critical target can be achieved by the means of Building Information Modeling (BIM), a process involving the generation and management of digital information related to the physical and functional characteristics of a facility, enhancing their fruition and fostering the cooperation between all actors involved in both Building Design and Operation. BIM can be therefore used as a support to final-use-oriented Building Design or to efficient and effective Operations planning, monitoring and control, enabling externalization of services to private specialized organizations, a procedure which is particularly advantageous for Public Administration, as it allows to decrease risk, costs and ensures quality. BIM systems are also easily entrustable to external providers, overcoming main difficulties met in their implementation, which is to find economic resources to afford it and to deal with its technical complexities. In this paper, a specific implementation of a BIM in Building Operating Management is presented and discussed through the introduction of the eniservizi (a company of eni, Italian leading operator in the area of petroleum products and energy) case study, where a particular BIM layer related to Site Compliance, the body of activities related to legal and regulatory aspects, and to Vendor Compliance, has been created, generating a <b>procurement</b> <b>control</b> system for monitoring compliance of service contractors to contractual obligations, right from the very initial pre-qualification phases, through the service provision steps, to the conclusive financial phases.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In a {{situation}} when government expenditures for defense are more restrictive, any {{investment in the}} acquisition of arms and military equipment (AME) {{is a question that}} does not allow errors in decisions. Accordingly, the economic analysis of the investment must be detailed and unavoidable. In the past, the initial cost of procurement of AME was often the primary, and sometimes the only one criterion in decision-making. Neglecting the analysis of costs throughout the life of assets in prefeasibility studies is the main cause of unplanned investment in the later stages of the life cycle of investment, and also of a number of problems in the functioning and unfulfilling or partially fulfilling the goals of the system. PROCESS OF EQUIPPING THE MoD AND THE SAF WITH AME Legislation governing the process of equipping the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) with AME is based on the Regulation on equipping the Yugoslav Army with weapons and military equipment in peacetime, from 1996, and on several Standards of National Defense (SNO 0477 / 83, SNO 1096 / 85, SNO 8196 / 92, SNO 9000 / 97, etc.). Due to a number of social and organizational changes in the defense system, this regulation is not in full compliance with real-time requirements. The analysis of legal regulations and activities in the process of equipping the MoD and the SAF with AME in practice indicates dominance of technical - technological aspects of the equipping analysis, while the economic aspect (primarily aspect of costs) is present, but not detailed enough. At best, there is only a static approach to the analysis and evaluation of investment projects, while a dynamic aspect and the aspect of the total cost over the life of assets are not taken into account. ANALYSIS OF COSTS IN THE LIFETIME OF ASSETS Given the non-profit character of military organizations and the possibility to express explicit costs, but not the benefits of investment in equipping with AME, costs {{are one of the most}} dominant parameters in decision-making. Modern trends in this area comprehensively perceive all costs during the life cycle of assets. In general, in the analysis of costs in the life cycle of AME there are two sets of costs: visible and invisible (hidden) costs. The visible part of the costs is mainly present in decision-making and usually includes the cost of equipping units or purchase of assets. The invisible part of the costs is far more significant. Although it is larger than the visible part and covers more groups of costs, decision-makers often do not take it into account. The hidden costs include: distribution costs, operating costs, maintenance costs, training costs, inventory costs, information systems costs, the cost of disposal and write-offs, etc. The decision making problem about investment in the AME purchase and equipping is obviously of  multicriteria nature, whether an optimum combination of costs for one  technical system (AME) is in question, or whether it is a choice of a system of AME among many offered. COST ANALYSIS OF A PARTICULAR  ASSET For the illustration of an integrated approach to the analysis of the cost of assets in their life-cycle, a model from the US Naval Postgraduate School, was adjusted and applied on an example of a real asset. The model is applied to the case of two  squadrons of identical aircraft based at different airports. With regard to the availability, confidentiality, and the variability of costs and reliability of the elements of AME, the calculations in the model are implemented on the basis of the estimated or orientation parameters. Essentially, the goal is to demonstrate the interdependence, mutual relations and influences of parameters and their ultimate impact on the overall cost of military assets. Applying the model to a particular example points to the fact that, in the first years of asset life, the dominant cost is that of asset procurement (cost of acquisition, cost of assets themselves, the price of equipment for service and maintenance, the costs of initial training of a number of personnel and distribution costs). When assets are new and introduced gradually in phases within the warranty period, the costs of asset maintaining and upgrading are not significant at that period. During this period, the main costs are the costs of personnel and training. Maintenance costs increase over time, and at the half of the life cycle there are special investments in the development and modernization of equipment, as well as in testing the reliability of individual elements, etc [...] Due to years of use, the operating costs of assets grow until the expiration of their life cycle, when there is a possibility of selling them and achieving certain profit. When looking at how the dynamics of individual costs affect the overall cost of assets in their life cycle, it is evident that most of the percentage of costs are the costs of asset operating and maintaining - about 66 %. The costs of testing and training follow with 16 %, 12 % is attributed to personnel costs, 6 % to training costs, etc [...] CONTRIBUTION TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF FUNDS ALLOCATED TO AME PROCUREMENT In order to provide the necessary funds when they are needed and at optimal cost, it is necessary to carry out adequate strategic, managerial, operational and administrative activities. Strategic actions in defense systems, in this sense, include: planning and development of procurement organization and infrastructure, determination of the best use of expertise and procurement resources, identification of the working standards to be achieved, and the establishment of control and reporting mechanisms. Control activities are the identification of modes for the best satisfaction of perceived needs, planning and coordination in procurement, training and staff development as well as acquisition performance  measurement. Operational activities are demanding specifications, examining options of research of the supply of goods or services, bid and supplier evaluation, negotiations, as well as contract and project administration. Administrative activities include processing and dispatching orders, comparing delivery and receipt confirmations, invoice receipt and verification, record-keeping and others. The identified existing and potential failures occurring in the procurement of military assets and affecting the optimization of use of financial resources, include: lack of adequate staff, imprecise legal regulations of procurement, lack of multi-year framework agreements related to the acquisition, insufficient and inadequate market research, incomplete adherence to the existing norms, late placing of funds at the disposal of the procurement service, untimely and inaccurate procurement planning, poor quality technical documentation, disrespect for deadlines, inadequate frequency of purchases, a number of "urgent and confidential procurements,", absence of a system limiting the time of procurement activities, absence of an adequate structure to deal with <b>procurement</b> <b>control,</b> etc. In addition, an integrated information system or a database that would allow access to the data and the analysis of the dynamics of costs would ensure proper assessment of costs of investments in equipping the military with AME [...] CONCLUSION Determining AME  life cycle costs should be made at an early phase of asset development because it can repeatedly affect the total amount and cost reduction through project changing. In the cost analysis, it is desirable to use mathematical models and methods developed in the theory and practice to allow accurate calculations of the elements necessary for a cost estimate. The biggest costs occur in the functional competence of logistics which shows that equipping the army must be based on logistic grounds for efficiency and cost saving throughout the life cycle of the asset. The initial cost of assets in relation to the costs that appear at the end of their life cycle is only a few percent and all other expenses are related to support costs. All presented elements are necessary to be analyzed through the existing organization of the military and the logistic support system, because deviations or adjustments to specific operating conditions can bring significant cost saving as well. Due to the multi-disciplinary and multi-criteria character of the process of equipping the military with AME, it is necessary to form project teams that will adequately manage the process. When the equipping is of strategic importance for the country, it is necessary that the Government and relevant ministries  take an adequate role in the process. An integrated approach to the budget and the reduction of AME life cycle costs should follow the general trends in the reform of public (state) sector such as: cost and efficiency optimization, team approach to solving complex problems, greater transparency, shorter response time, introduction of a labor-incentive system, reducing administration, public-private partnerships and multinational projects. The aim is to provide a better solution, product or service or a higher level of satisfaction of the public (state) interests with lower consumption of resources. In the defense sector, this means sustainable and smart defense and multinational approach in the implementation of costly projects. In order to optimize the AME life cycle costs, it is necessary, at all levels of study and training of personnel, to study certain features of integrated logistic support, to apply proper concepts and approaches and to predict and monitor organizational and technological changes in the defense system.  </p...|$|E
