5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally {{take place in the}} morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being <b>plucked,</b> as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been <b>plucked.</b> The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The <b>plucked</b> carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to analyze the financial benefit of using Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method. The approach of the research is to compare the cash flow from Shear <b>Plucking</b> and Manual <b>Plucking</b> in one <b>plucking</b> cycle (4 years). Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method need additional treatment for land handling, additional tool for the modified scissor and additional fertilizer for the land. These treatments need additional cost. In the other side, Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce tea more than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method. Result of the research, show that Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method give more benefit than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method. Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce about 5. 000 to 6. 000 tons tea per hectare per year. Manual <b>Plucking</b> only produce tea about 2. 500 to 3. 000 tons per hectare per year. It means Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method produce about 2. 000 to 3. 000 tons more tea, than Manual <b>Plucking</b> per hectare per year. The cost of Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method is higher than Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method, but if we compared with amount of product that produces by Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method, Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS) in this method is still lower than Cost Of Goods (COGS) in Manual <b>Plucking</b> method. The average price of goods sale for Manual <b>Plucking</b> method is more beneficial than Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method, because it's influence by the quality or grade of tea that can be produced by each method. Manual <b>Plucking</b> Method quality or grade of tea is better than Shear <b>Plucking</b> Method.

5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a <b>plucked</b> rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
