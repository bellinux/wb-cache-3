These machines were replaced step by step by diesel locomotives from the German builders Schöma and Diema, delivered from 1963 until 1981. Many running numbers of the locomotives were used twice {{on the occasion of}} the replacement purchase. In the 1980s there were still reported to exist about more than two dozens diesel, the elder once out of use or derelict. The newest and for sure the last supply in the way of locomotives were two locos which came in 1985 from the Japanese Hokuriko Juki Kogyo Co Ltd from Niigata, which supplied lots of further light railways engines to indonesian sugar factories same time. These two were for a long time the only remaining servicable machines. During a visit on in July 2008, these two Japanese locomotives still collected the <b>palmfruits</b> and came back to the little factory in the afternoon. All other still existing diesel locomotives were already dumped in the shed. The bigger part of the <b>palmfruits</b> had already carried by means of trucks from the plantation to the factory, where the fruits are reloaded to light railway waggons and pulled and pushed by capstan and fork-lift.|$|R
