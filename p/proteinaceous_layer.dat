50|$|The Davson-Danielli {{model was}} {{a model of the}} plasma {{membrane}} of a cell, proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli. The model describes a phospholipid bilayer that lies between two layers of globular proteins. The phospholipid bilayer had already been proposed by Gorter and Grendel in 1925; however, the flanking <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layers</b> in the Davson-Danielli model were novel and intended to explain Danielli's observations on the surface tension of lipid bilayers (It is now known that the phospholipid head groups are sufficient to explain the measured surface tension). The Davson-Danielli model predominated until Singer and Nicolson advanced the fluid mosaic model in 1972. The fluid mosaic model expanded on the Davson-Danielli model by including transmembrane proteins, and eliminated the previously-proposed flanking protein layers that were not well-supported by experimental evidence.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Ectocarpus siliculosus virus (EsV- 1) is endemic in all {{populations of}} the {{cosmopolitan}} filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus. EsV- 1 has a large circular double-stranded DNA genome of about 320 kilobase pairs, and a complex virion structure with a central nucleoprotein core surrounded by several <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layers.</b> To investigate the protein composition of the virion, we screened an expression library of EsV- 1 with antibodies raised against purified detergent-disrupted viral particles. We isolated several clones encoding novel structural proteins and investigated {{two of them in}} detail. These clones encode viral proteins vp 55 and vp 74. Electron microscopy reveals that vp 55 is most likely a component of the surface of the viral core, whereas vp 74 may be part of an inner core structure.

50|$|Males {{are about}} 15 - 31 cm long, and 2 - 4 mm wide. The {{posterior}} end is curved toward the ventral {{side with a}} pointed tail. They have simple spicules that measure 2.0 - 3.5 mm long. Females are larger than males, measuring 20 - 49 cm long and 3 - 6 mm in diameter. From the anterior end, the vulva occupies {{about one-third of the}} body length. In addition to their large size, these species also have the three prominent lips. Each lip contains a dentigerous ridge, and no interlabia or alae. Females can lay up to 200,000 eggs per day, and their uteri can contain up to 27 million eggs at a time. Fertilized eggs are ovoid, ranging from 45 to 75 µm length and 35 to 50 µm in diameter. The uterine wall contributes to the lumpy and thick outer layer of the egg. The mammillated layer is stained golden-brown by the bile when the eggs are passed in faeces. Females can also deposit unfertilized eggs that are narrower and longer than normal fertilized eggs, ranging from 88 to 94 µm in length, and 44 µm diameter. Only the <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> can be seen in unfertilized eggs, because after fertilization, the vitelline, chitinous, and lipid layers form.|$|E

The greatest capacitance decrease for both proteins was observed when exposure occurred at or more positive to the electrode open circuit potential (OCP). Exposure to Ig.

40|$|The {{development}} of an optoelectric device (TruScan™) {{for the detection of}} cervical cancer provides the framework for this thesis. TruScan™ stimulates the cervical tissue with low energy electrical pulses producing a tissue response. This response is recorded at the three electrode tip and the signal is interpreted for a tissue classification. The aim of this work was to measure the extent of protein adsorption onto metal electrodes under various conditions, and then investigate the effects this protein layer had on the electrochemical behaviour measured at the electrode/solution interface. The adsorption trends of proteins, and the effect that adsorption has on electrochemical responses of metal electrodes has been studied using various experimental techniques. The effect of pH and electrode potential on adsorption trends has been investigated using the proteins human serum albumin (HSA) and human immunoglobulin G (Ig. G) at both gold (Au) and titanium dioxide (Ti 02) metal surfaces. This work showed that protein adsorbs spontaneously at metal electrodes at neutral pH. The protein adsorption trends followed electrostatic interactions, with the greatest amount of adsorption occurring when the electrode and protein had opposite charges, and the least amount when they possessed the same charge. The extent of protein adsorption also appeared to be influenced by the waveform of the applied potential. Only {{a small percentage of the}} total adsorbed protein could be removed. This was attributed to the denaturing of the protein allowing it to form multiple binding sites, which increased its binding strength. This result lead to the hypothesis of two types of bound protein, namely weakly and strongly bound. Spectroscopic studies showed that the presence of phosphate in the protein solution hinders adsorption, resulting in lower adsorbed amounts. Phosphate was also shown to partially displace preadsorbed protein from a Ti 02 surface. The fact that not all of the preadsorbed protein was displaced strengthened the hypothesis of two types of bound protein. The effect of protein adsorption on the electrochemical behaviour of metal electrodes was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Upon adsorption of protein at Au and Ti 02 the capacitance decreased, which was attributed to the formation of a <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> on the electrode surface. This decrease in capacitance was accentuated when the electrode surface was treated in such a way that the surface area and roughness increased. The formation of a <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> on the electrode surface had the effect of increasing the charge transfer resistance. The resistance to charge transfer was shown to increase as the amount of adsorbed protein increased due to the increase in <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. The electrode/electrolyte interface, for both electrode materials, was successfully modelled using a modified Randies circuit...|$|E

The mechanisms underlying tegumentation remain largely undefined for all herpesviruses.

This region of VP 22 (residues 165 – 225) overlaps the glycoprotein E (gE) binding domain of VP 22 (residues 165 – 270), which is sufficient to mediate VP 22 packaging into assembling virus particles. To ascertain {{the contribution of the}} VP 16 and gE binding activities of VP 22 to its virion incorporation, a transfection/infection based virion incorporation assay, using point mutants that discern between the two binding activities, was utilized.

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify VP 22 mutants which abrogate interaction with gE but retain VP 16 binding. Virion incorporation assays demonstrated that failure to bind gE did not abrogate VP 22 packaging. A region of VP 22 which binds to both VP 16 and gE failed to be packaged efficiently, with wild-type levels of incorporation only attained when residues 43 – 86 of VP 22 were present.

Infertile eggs were less uniform in shape and generally did not have well-defined shell layers, the formation of which is triggered by sperm penetration of the oocyte.

Within the crenarchaea, the S-layer often represents the only cell wall component, but there are various exceptions from this wall architecture. Beside (glycosylated) S-layers in (hyper) thermophilic cren- and euryarchaea as well as halophilic archaea, one can find a great variety of other cell wall structures like proteoglycan-like S-layers (Halobacteria), glutaminylglycan (Natronococci), methanochondroitin (Methanosarcina) or double layered cell walls with pseudomurein (Methanothermus and Methanopyrus). The presence of an outermost cellular membrane in the crenarchaeal species Ignicoccus hospitalis already gave indications for an outer membrane similar to Gram-negative bacteria.

Under physiological conditions many of these functions are involved in wound healing or eradication of an invading pathogen.

In the present study we investigated how the activity of thrombin is modulated when it is bound {{to the surface of}} Streptococcus pyogenes. Our data show that S. pyogenes bacteria become covered with a <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> when incubated with human plasma, and that thrombin is a constituent of this layer. Though the coagulation factor is found attached to the bacteria with a functional active site, thrombin has lost its capacity to interact with its natural substrates and inhibitors.

The adsorbed amounts of Ig. G agreed well with previous results and showed approximately monolayer coverage. The amount of adsorbed protein increased when a positive potential was applied to the electrode, while the application of a negative potential resulted in a decrease. Exposure to solutions of Ig.

Single-step growth analyses, protein synthesis time courses, andmRNA quantifications indicated that the absence of UL 21 results in a delay early in the HSV- 1 replication cycle.

40|$|During {{oogenesis}} in Drosophila melanogaster, the {{ovarian follicle}} cells secrete approximately thirty proteins in a well defined sequence {{to construct an}} eggshell around the developing oocyte. The eggshell impacts {{on the success of}} several reproductive processes: it allows and facilitates fertilization, oviposition, embryogenesis, and hatching. Understanding the eggshell in molecular terms {{is likely to be a}} prerequisite for understanding its multiple functions during early development. The eggshell consists of three major <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layers.</b> The morphologically homogeneous vitelline membrane (VM) is proximal to the oocyte surface. Overlying the VM are the progressively distal inner chorionic (ICL) and endochorion layers. The mature ICL is crystalline; the distinctive endochorion exhibits a floor-pillar-roof tripartite substructure. Compositionally aberrant eggshells produced by some female sterile mutants exhibit fatal disruptions of this three-dimensional architecture. While most biochemical, morphological, and genetic data suggest that apposition of sequentially secreted proteins contributes to layer morphogenesis, a paucity of flies mutant at eggshell structural gene loci and a lack of molecular resolution have prevented confirmation or contradiction of this assembly model. sV 17 and sV 23 are two proteins synthesized primarily during stages 9 - 10 of oogenesis when VM is laid down. s 36 and s 18 accumulate during early (stages 11 - 13) and late (stages 13 - 14) endochorion formation, respectively. In this study, an immunological approach has begun defining the eggshell at a molecular level by following the production, secretion, and assembly-related behavior of these four proteins. The results contradict a strict model of assembly by apposition as s 18 intercalates into an endochorion floor-pillar-roof framework already defined by earlier proteins, including s 36. In addition, this work shows that sV 17 and sV 23 are stage-specifically processed in the VM to smaller derivatives and that minor quantities of vitelline membrane and early chorion antigens are internalized by the oocyte. This work further suggests that the vitelline membrane may serve as a transient reservoir for s 36 prior to its assembly into the overlying endochorion, and maintenance of chorion morphological integrity is dependent upon the presence of a vitelline membrane protein, sV 23...|$|R

Alterations in the geometrical arrangements of the VP 5 subunits in the capsomeres exposes different residues, resulting in the differential association of the tegument and VP 26 with the pentons and hexons, respectively.

We identified 38 B. subtilis spore proteins, 12 of which are known coat proteins. We propose that, of the novel proteins, YtaA, YvdP, and YnzH are bona fide coat proteins, and we have renamed them CotI, CotQ, and CotU, respectively. In addition, we initiated a study of coat proteins in B. anthracis and identified 11 spore proteins, 6 of which are candidate coat or exosporium proteins. We also queried the unfinished B. anthracis genome for potential coat proteins. Our analysis suggests that the B. subtilis and B. anthracis coats have roughly similar numbers of proteins and that a core group of coat protein species is shared between these organisms, including the major morphogenetic proteins. Nonetheless, a significant number of coat proteins are probably unique to each species.

SYPRO® Ruby staining was used as a screening technique to probe the presence of proteins in the sample cross-section. Results revealed the presence of several layers containing proteins among which a thin <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>layer</b> located between the silver leaf and the glaze. This thin layer is described as fish glue coating by historical sources but its composition has not been identified yet. The optimized methodology, based on high resolution mass spectrometry and adapted bioinformatic tools, was successfully applied to 50 μg of a polychromy sample and resulted in the identification of several collagen proteins. Extensive interpretation of data generated by tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of proteins from different biological origins. In particular, seven peptides specific to fish collagen proteins were identified for the first time proving the presence of fish glue in the sample and corroborating information found in historical texts dealing with the polychromy technique...|$|E

In bacteria, the latter is called the S-layer, in Actinomycetes, the rod-like fibrillar layer, and in fungi, the rodlet layer [1]. The self-assembly properties and remarkable structural and physicochemical characteristics of hydrophobin proteins underlie the multiple roles played by these unique proteins in fungal biology. What Are Hydrophobins? Hydrophobins, low molecular mass (# 20 kDa) secreted proteins of fungi, are characterized by moderate to high levels of hydrophobicity and the presence of eight conserved cysteine (Cys) residues. These proteins are able to assemble spontaneously into amphipathic monolayers at hydrophobic–hydrophilic inter-faces. Although functional homologues are reported in Streptomyces (chaplins, SapB, and SapT for aerial morphogenesis; [2]), hydrophobins are unique to the fungal kingdom. Fungal genome analyses have indicated that hydrophobins generally exist as small gene families with two to ten members, although certain species contain more members (e. g., Coprinus cinereus displays 33 members...|$|R

The properties of these archaeal Au nanoparticles differ significantly from those produced earlier by us onto bacterial S‐layer sheets. The archaeal Au nanoparticles, with a size of about 2. 5 nm, consist exclusively of metallic Au(0), while those produced on the bacterial S‐layer had a size of about 4 nm and represented a mixture of Au(0) and Au(III) in the ratio of 40 to 60 %.    The most impressive feature of the archaeal Au nanoparticles {{is that they are}} strongly paramagnetic, in contrast to the bacterial ones and also to bulk gold. SQUID magnetometry and XMCD measurements demonstrated that the archaeal Au nanoparticles possess a rather large magnetic moment of about 0. 1 B/atom. HR‐ TEM‐EDX analysis revealed that the archaeal Au nanoparticles are linked to the sulfur atoms of the thiol groups of the amino acid cysteine, characteristic only for archaeal S‐layers. This is the first study demonstrating the formation of such unusually strong magnetic Au nanoparticles on a non‐modified archaeal S‐laye...|$|R

The central mausoleum, named the Hallof Twelve Columns, encloses the tombs of Ahmed al-Mansour and his family. The hall has a huge vaultedceiling, carved cedar doors, opening windows with wooden marquetry screen (Mashrabiya), and greyItalian marble columns. This paper presents the first attempt to identify the organic materials used bythe Moroccan artisans. A GC/MS analytical procedure {{was used for the}} characterization of lipids, waxes,resins, pitch, tar, proteinaceous and saccharide materials in the same paint micro-sample. The analyticalstudy identified the organic materials used in the polychrome and gilded decorations of the walls, ceilingand dome of the hall. Data showed that the polychrome decorations were painted using animal glueas a binder, and highlighted the treatment of the wall surface with linseed oil and the retouching ofthe paintings based on a saccharide binder. The use of a proteinaceous-resinous-oil mixture, applied ona <b>proteinaceous</b> preparation <b>layer,</b> for the gilded decorations revealed a very similar technique to thatused at the time in Europe for mural painting...|$|R
