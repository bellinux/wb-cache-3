50|$|The {{island is}} known for its range of primates, {{including}} the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor), Mentawai langur (Presbytis potenziani) and Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis).|$|E
50|$|The park is {{estimated}} to contain over {{five percent of the}} world's species. Wild mammals include Malayan tapir, Asian elephant, tiger, sambar deer, bear, guar, banteng, serow, wild boar, <b>pig-tailed</b> macaque, <b>langur,</b> white handed gibbons, squirrel, muntjak, mouse deer, barking deer.|$|R
3000|$|Of {{the four}} primate species {{occurring}} on Siberut, the Kloss gibbons, the Mentawai <b>langurs</b> and the <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langurs</b> have been reasonably well studied (e.g. Tenaza 1975;Tilson 1977;Watanabe 1981;Tilson and Tenaza 1982;Whitten 1982 a;Whitten 1982 b;Whitten 1982 c;Tenaza and Tilson 1985;Fuentes 1997;Hadi et al. 2009 a;Erb et al. 2012 b;Hadi et al. 2012). In contrast, {{studies on the}} Siberut macaque are mainly limited to investigations on population size, acoustic traits, phylogenetic relationships and some preliminary observations on ecology (Whitten and Whitten 1982;Abegg and Thierry 2002 b;Roos et al. 2003;Ziegler et al. 2007;Schneider et al. 2008;Waltert et al. 2008;Quinten et al. 2009).

50|$|Bherjan-Borajan-Padumoni Wildlife Sanctuary (ভেৰজান, বোকাজান, পদুমনি অভয়াৰণ্য) is a {{protected}} area located in Tinsukia district of Assam in India covering 7.22 km2. This wildlife sanctuary is spread across three blocks located in Tinsukia district of Upper Assam which consist of three separate forests, namely Bherjan, Borajan and Padumoni. It {{is a very}} important forest in terms of conservation and includes habitat for hoolock gibbon, capped <b>langur,</b> <b>pig-tailed</b> macaque, slow loris, rhesus macaque, leopard, etc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> is a {{large and}} rather heavily built Old World monkey, adapted to {{climbing}} with its long arms. Its fur is black-brown, and its hairless face is also black. It is the only monkey in the subfamily Colobinae to have a relatively short tail; the tail is only slightly furred and is only 15 cm long. The short nose is pointed upward. The <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> reaches a full grown length of approximately 50 cm (20 in) and a weight of 7 kg (15.5 lbs). Traditionally, it has been placed in the genus Nasalis together with the proboscis monkey - a treatment still preferred by some.|$|E
50|$|The park protects four {{endangered}} endemic primate species: Kloss's gibbon (Hylobates klossii), Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), Siberut langur (Presbytis potenziani ssp. siberu) and <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor ssp. siberu). Among the 31 {{species of}} mammals {{in the park}} there are four endemic species of squirrel.|$|E
50|$|Around 40 {{primates}} from 200 primate {{species in}} the world found in Indonesian forests. Four Indonesian primates were included among the 25 most endangered primates in the world; they are the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), the Siau Island tarsier (Tarsius tumpara), the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) and the <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor).|$|E
50|$|Sepahijala Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary in Tripura, India of some 18.53 km2, about 25 km {{from the city}} centre, located in Bishalgarh. It is a woodland with an artificial lake and natural botanical and zoological gardens. It {{is famous for its}} clouded leopard enclosures. The sanctuary contains a variety of birds, primates, and other animals. The terrain is green throughout the year and the weather is temperate except for the two humid summer months of March and April. It gives shelter to about 150 species of birds and the unique bespectacled monkey, Phayre's langur.The primate section consists of four species (rhesus macaque, <b>pig-tailed</b> macaque, capped <b>langur</b> and spectacled langur). The crab-eating mongoose (last sighted in the 1930s) has been resuscitated. The sanctuary has been developed both as {{a wildlife}} sanctuary and as an academic and research centre.About 150 species of birds live in the sanctuary, and migratory birds visit in winter. Initiated in 1972 the sanctuary has five sections: carnivores, primates, ungulates, reptiles and aviary. There are several lakes;among which Amrit Sagar named lake have boating facility.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the centuries}} of human {{clearance}} and exploitation, {{the forests and}} grasslands along the river remain a habitat {{for a variety of}} wildlife including tiger (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), capped langur, (Semnopithecus pileatus), gaur (Bos gaurus), barasingha deer (Cervus duvaucelii), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), India's largest population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and the world's largest population of Indian rhinoceros, while Asian black bears live in the higher slopes of the valley sides. Most of these mammals are threatened or endangered species. The Brahmaputra is a natural barrier to the migration of much wildlife and many species, such as the pygmy hog, hispid hare, or the Malayan sun bear, <b>pig-tailed</b> macaque, golden <b>langur,</b> stump-tailed macaque, western hoolock gibbon live {{on one side of the}} river only. The area is a meeting point of species of Indian and Malayan origin. The endemic mammals of the valley are the pygmy hog and the hispid hare, both of which inhabit the grasslands of the riverbanks.|$|R
50|$|Homo, Lemur, and Vespertilio {{have survived}} as generic names, but Simia has not. All the species {{have since been}} moved to other genera, and in 1929, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in its Opinion 114 that Simia be suppressed. The genus Simias is {{distinct}} and remains valid, containing a single species, the <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor).|$|E
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{separated}} from Sumatra since the mid-Pleistocene period, which has allowed at least twenty endemic species to develop amongst its flora and fauna. This includes five endemic primates: the Mentawai or kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis), Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), Mentawai leaf monkey (Presbytis potenziani), and <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor). They are highly endangered due to logging, unsustainable hunting, and conversion of rainforest to palm oil plantations. Some areas of the Mentawai Islands rainforest ecoregion are protected, such as the Siberut National Park. Red junglefowl, the Asian palm civet and crab-eating macaque are also native.|$|E
50|$|Further, in {{comparison}} with Old World monkeys, hominoids are noted for: more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula; broader ribcages that are flatter front-to-back; and a shorter, less mobile spine, with greatly reduced caudal (tail) vertebrae—resulting in complete loss of the tail in living hominoid species. These are anatomical adaptations, first, to vertical hanging and swinging locomotion (brachiation) and, later, to developing balance in a bipedal pose. Note there are primates in other families that also lack tails, and at least one, the <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur,</b> is known to walk significant distances bipedally. The front of the ape skull is characterised by its sinuses, fusion of the frontal bone, and by post-orbital constriction.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> (Simias concolor), {{monotypic}} in genus Simias, {{is a large}} Old World monkey, {{endemic to}} several small islands {{off the coast of}} Sumatra in Indonesia. Its face is black, its fur is blackish-brown and it has a relatively short tail. It is a diurnal species, feeding in small groups in the rainforest canopy on leaves, and to a lesser extent, fruit and berries. Little is known of its natural history, but it is heavily hunted, its populations have been declining rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "critically endangered". It has been included on a list of the World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.|$|E
30|$|Primate species {{richness}} on Mentawai is unusually high. On a land {{surface area of}} only 6, 549  km 2, Mentawai harbors five endemic primate species (Fuentes 1997 / 1997), the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), the Mentawai langur (Presbytis potenziani), the <b>pig-tailed</b> <b>langur</b> or pig-tailed snub-nosed monkey (Simias concolor), the Pagai island macaque (Macaca pagensis) and the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu). Whereas the first three species occur on all four islands, M. pagensis only occurs on the three southern islands, and M. siberu exclusively on Siberut. All Mentawaian primates {{are included in the}} IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2012). They are threatened by habitat loss due to legal and illegal logging, conversion of the forest into oil palm plantations, forest clearing, extraction of forest products (such as rattan), hunting and pet trade (Whittaker 2006). In Siberut, forest cover has decreased to 60 % (by 2005; Whittaker 2006), but part of it is protected by the national park, which includes 465  km 2 of protected “no-use” sanctuary zone where no hunting and logging is allowed (WWF 1980; Fuentes 1997 / 1997;Whittaker 2006).|$|E
