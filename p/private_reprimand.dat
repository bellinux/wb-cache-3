60|$|No man can conceive, till {{he comes}} to try it, how great a pain {{it is to be}} a public-spirited person. I am sure I am unable to express to the world, how much anxiety I have suffered, to see of how little benefit my Lucubrations have been to my fellow-subjects. Men will go on in their own way in spite of all my labour. I gave Mr. Didapper a <b>private</b> <b>reprimand</b> for wearing red-heeled shoes, and at the same time was so indulgent as to connive at him for {{fourteen}} days, because I would give him the wearing of them out; but after all this I am informed, he appeared yesterday with a new pair of the same sort. I have no better success with Mr. Whatdee'call[1] as to his buttons: Stentor[2] still roars; and box and dice rattle as loud as they did before I writ against them. Partridge[3] walks about at noon-day, and Aesculapius[4] thinks of adding a new lace to his livery. However, I must still go on in laying these enormities before men's eyes, and let them answer for going on in their practice.[5] My province is much larger than at first sight men would imagine, and I shall lose no part of my jurisdiction, which extends not only to futurity, but also is retrospect to things past; and the behaviour of persons who have long ago acted their parts, is as much liable to my examination, as that of my own contemporaries.|$|E
5000|$|On June 19, 2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered Berg {{suspended}} {{for two years}} for neglecting the 2006 federal lawsuit, stating that he filed the lawsuit {{on the last day}} for filing and subsequently [...] "did virtually nothing to prosecute his client's claim," [...] resulting in the case being dismissed. Berg then failed to notify his client of the dismissal and [...] "over the next two years [...] [...] [...] mostly ignored his client's requests for updates" [...] while leading her [...] "to believe that her case was still viable." [...] As aggravating factors in supporting the suspension, it was noted that Berg failed to [...] "express adequate remorse" [...] or apologize to the client. Also noted was his extensive disciplinary history, including a <b>private</b> <b>reprimand</b> in 2005 for commingling funds, an informal admonition in 2006 for neglect of a matter that resulted in dismissal of a client's case and a <b>private</b> <b>reprimand</b> and one year probation imposed in 2008 for failing to pursue a workers' compensation matter.|$|E
50|$|On Colonial One, Roslin is badgered with {{questions}} from reporters about {{the resurgence of}} her cancer. Tory Foster, suffering from constantly hearing the music {{in the same way}} as Colonel Tigh, angrily tells the reporters to stop prying into Roslin's personal affairs, earning her a <b>private</b> <b>reprimand</b> from Roslin. On Galactica's bridge, Felix Gaeta and Helo review a plan to use the refinery ship as a decoy to lure the Cylons off course, and brood over a gathering storm.|$|E

50|$|In December 1936, he {{proposed}} a bill to Majles that would seal a large contract with two American companies. The bill came under heavy protest from the British and the Russian governments, putting intense pressure on Dāvar's ministry.On 10 February 1937 the news of Dāvar's apparent suicide took the capital Tehran by storm. Rumors spread that two days earlier Dāvar had been in <b>private</b> severely <b>reprimanded</b> and threatened by Reza Pahlavi. Some newspapers wrote that he {{had died of a}} heart attack, however others suggested that his death had been related to his proposed American bill to Majlis. Davar is said to have died by an overdose of opium.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 Barschak {{became a}} {{professor}} at the public institute for teaching vocational education in Berlin, she was however removed from this post in 1933 following the rise to power of the Nazi party in Germany. Barschak was able to leave Berlin and move to London and Genf to study psychology, which spared her the experience of career stagnation, as well as further occupational and <b>private</b> <b>reprimands.</b> However Barschak returned in 1935, while the Nazis were still in power, for an involvement in the Jewish educational system. She taught psychology and pedagogy at the Jewish academy for the education of teachers in Berlin and was actively involved in the preparation for emigration within the education system. This work, which she organised together with Fritz Bamberger, erroneously associated Barschak with Zionism.In September 1939, notably the month of the invasion of Poland by the Nazis and thus marking the beginning of World War II, Barschak began to prepare her emigration by getting into contact with people she was associated with. In 1940 she reached the US via Great Britain {{and with the help of}} the American Association of University Women (AAUW), secured a place as a Refugee Scholar at the Wilson College in Pennsylvania for the academic year 1941/42, a position that a year later would be transferred to Susanne Charlotte Engelmann. Similar to Susanne Charlotte Engelmanns experience, this job opened up a way into academia which fortunately saved the career aspirations of the two women. Hence Erna Barschak subsequently became a professor for psychology at the Miami University in Ohio.|$|R
5000|$|In 1945, on a Pacific island, Sam Gifford (Wagner) is busted from platoon {{sergeant}} to <b>private</b> and <b>reprimanded</b> by his {{battalion commander}} for striking an officer. Because {{he had earned}} a Silver Star, he is given a choice of being sentenced to the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Leavenworth or transferred to George Company, a de facto punishment company assigned to a dangerous area of the front lines. Gifford chooses the punishment company, which is commanded by Captain Grimes, a former First Sergeant (Broderick Crawford). Captain Grimes insists everyone call him [...] "Waco", wears no rank insignia and forbids military salutes lest he become a target for snipers. Everyone in George Company hates Waco except for some pre-war regular army comrades-in-arms Millard (Frank Gorshin) and Swanson (Skip Homeier), who act as Waco's personal bodyguards. Impressed by Gifford's combat record, Waco offers him a membership in his private circle as a radio operator. This ends when Gifford beats up Swanson for making suggestive remarks about his wife's photograph. Waco burns the photograph. The incident triggers flashbacks in which Sam relives the path that brought him to this purgatory.|$|R
2500|$|The loss {{of their}} senior {{officers}} and the defeat at Bound Brook apparently caused [...] "distracted" [...] behavior in the ranks. In General Orders of 28 April at Morristown, New Jersey, Private Samuel Philips was sentenced to be <b>reprimanded,</b> <b>Private</b> Henry Randall and Ensign McKee were acquitted, and Lieutenant Simrall was cashiered for refusing to do his duty. Washington appended the following note. The Commander in Chief (taking into consideration the late distracted State of the 8th. Pennsyl. Battalion, an inquiry into the cause of which he has directed to be made without loss of time) is pleased to suspend {{the execution of the}} Sentences of Alexander McKay, David Livinston, John Dilworth, John Edgar, Jacob Knight, John McClaugherry, William Roach, Daniel Clark, John Kirckendal, and Jacob Wilker -- Privates of that Battalion, 'till the proceedings of the Court are reported to him.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine students&# 039; {{perceptions}} of troublesome behaviour and the effectiveness of different disciplinary methods. To this end, 350 secondary school students completed the Classroom Behaviour Problems and Attitude Towards Disciplinary Methods questionnaire, and the results indicate that "talking out of turn" was the only behaviour perceived by both teachers and students to be most troublesome and most frequent. Deterrents that were perceived as most effective included being sent to the principal&# 039;s office, detention, and getting an unfavourable report sent home. Regarding incentives, free time, a positive letter home, receiving a good mark, and getting a favourable academic report sent home were perceived to be most effective, while <b>private</b> praise and <b>reprimands</b> were also seen as an effective means for increasing appropriate behaviour. However, previous research suggests that teachers are choosing to use other strategies that are not seen by students as effective. Therefore, it was concluded that both teachers and students need to be educated regarding the results found in the current study, so that effective management strategies can be developed and used by teachers...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only day her Majesty gave {{herself the}} {{diversion}} of a play, and [...] that on which she designed to see another, has furnished the town [...] with discourse for near a month. The choice of the play was THE [...] SPANISH FRIAR, the only play forbid by the late K[ing], Some [...] unhappy expressions, among which those that follow, put her in some [...] disorder, and forced her to hold up her fan, and often look behind [...] her, and call for her palatine and hood, and any thing she could [...] next think of; while those {{who were in the}} pit before her, turned [...] their heads over their shoulders, and all in general directed their [...] looks towards her, whenever their fancy led them to make any [...] application of what was said. In one place, where the queen of [...] Arragon is going to church in procession, 'tis said by a spectator, [...] 'Very good; she usurps the throne, keeps the old king in prison, [...] and, at the same time, is praying for a blessing on her army;'--And [...] when said, 'That 'tis observed at Court, who weeps, and who wears [...] black for good king Sancho's death,' 'tis said, 'Who is that, that [...] can flatter a Court like this? Can I sooth tyranny? seem pleas'd to [...] see my Royal Master murthered; his crown usurped; a distaff in the [...] throne?'--And 'What title has this queen, but lawless force; and [...] force must pull her down'--Twenty more things are said, which may [...] be wrested to what they were never designed: but however, the [...] observations then made furnished the town with talk, till something [...] else happened, which gave it much occasion for discourse; for [...] another play being ordered to be acted, the queen came not, being [...] taken up with other diversion. She dined with Mrs Gradens, the [...] famous woman in the hall, that sells fine laces and head-dresses; [...] from thence she went to the Jew's, that sells Indian things; to Mrs [...] Ferguson's, De Vett's, Mrs Harrison's, and other Indian houses; but [...] not to Mrs Potter's, though in her way; which caused Mrs Potter to [...] say, that she might as well have hoped for that honour as others, [...] considering that the whole design of bringing the queen and king [...] was managed at her house, and the consultations held there; so that [...] she might as well have thrown away a little money in raffling [...] there, {{as well as at the}} other houses: but it seems that my lord [...] Devonshire has got Mrs Potter to be laundress: she has not much [...] countenance of the queen, her daughter still keeping the Indian [...] house her mother had. The same day the queen went to one Mrs [...] Wise's, a famous woman for telling fortunes, but could not prevail [...] with her to tell anything; though to others she has been very true, [...] and has foretold that king James shall came in again, and the duke [...] of Norfolk shall lose his head: the last, I suppose, will naturally [...] be the consequence of the first. These things, however innocent, [...] have passed the censure of the town: and, besides a <b>private</b> [...] <b>reprimand</b> given, the king gave one in public; saying to the [...] queen, that he heard she dined at a bawdy-house, and desired the [...] next time she went, he might go. She said, she had done nothing but [...] what the late queen had done. He asked her, if she meant to make [...] her, her example. More was said on this occasion than ever was [...] known before; but it was borne with all the submission of a good [...] wife, who leaves all to the direction of the k----, and diverts [...] herself with walking six or seven miles a-day, and looking after [...] her buildings, making of fringes, and such like innocent things; [...] and does not meddle in government, though she has better title to [...] do it than the late queen had." ...|$|R
