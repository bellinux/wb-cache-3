5|$|The {{victory was}} Michael Schumacher's {{fifth of the}} season, his fourth at the circuit, and the result meant that he {{extended}} his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twenty-two points in front Coulthard, with Häkkinen a further two points behind. Ferrari also extended their lead in the Constructors' Championship, eighteen points ahead of McLaren. Benetton, on 18 points, <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> rivals Williams down to fourth place, with nine races of the season remaining. 100,000 people attended the race.|$|E
5|$|Between 23 and 27 May {{and again}} 30 May 1951, New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong, {{dispersing}} troop concentrations, dropping a bridge span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned {{at the end}} of this action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she lost one of her helicopters after the crew <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E

5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to preserve their lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance {{to take the lead in}} the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E
5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its full height and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of Ernst of Bavaria expanded the local feud {{into a more}} German-wide phenomenon. The pope committed 55,000crowns to pay soldiers to fight for Ernst, and another 40,000directly into the coffers of the new Archbishop. Under the command of his brother, Ernst's forces <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> way into Westphalia, threatening Gebhard and Agnes at their stronghold at Arensburg. Gebhard and Agnes escaped to the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands with almost 1000cavalry, where Prince William gave them a haven in Delft. There, Gebhard solicited the impecunious William for troops and money. After William's assassination in July 1584, Gebhard wrote to Queen Elizabeth requesting assistance. Elizabeth responded {{toward the end of}} 1585, directing him to contact Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, her deputy with the rebellious Dutch, and recently commissioned as the commander-in-chief of her army in the Netherlands. Elizabeth had her own problems with adherents of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|In 1879, Rowe {{joined the}} Dwyer Brothers Stable. On May 17, 1881, {{with the future}} Hall of Fame horse Hindoo, he became the {{youngest}} trainer to win the Kentucky Derby. Hindoo won eighteen straight races that year. The Dwyers <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> horses hard, {{in a manner that}} would be unacceptable and illegal today. Rowe quit the Dwyers in 1885 in a dispute regarding over-racing their horses, especially the mare Miss Woodford.|$|E
25|$|Sherman disembarked {{with three}} {{divisions}} at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River {{to approach the}} Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended.

Despite having early caucuses, Iowa, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri were not penalized because their contests did not allocate national delegates.|$|E

25|$|The duo {{formed a}} week after Brian Viglione {{witnessed}} Amanda Palmer perform solo at a Halloween party in 2000. Their live performances soon gained them a cult following. During these performances the two band members often wore dramatic make-up and fancy clothing that <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> cabaret/theater aesthetic. They encourage fans to become involved at their shows, with the fans' own stilt walking, living statues, fire breathers, and other performance art becoming {{an integral part of}} the show. The Dirty Business Brigade coordinated the fans' performances.|$|E
25|$|In late February, Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's Allied Army of Silesia {{advanced}} west toward Paris, {{pressing a}} badly outnumbered French force before it. When Kleist's Prussian II Corps took a menacing {{position on the}} north bank of the Marne River near Meaux, the French attacked and <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> adversaries back. When he learned that Napoleon's army was fast approaching from the southeast, Blücher abandoned the effort to force a way past Marmont and Mortier and began retreating to the north. The action occurred during the Campaign in north-east France, part of the War of the Sixth Coalition.|$|E
25|$|On December 26, three Union {{divisions}} under Sherman disembarked at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River {{to approach}} the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast while a fourth landed farther upstream on December 27. On December 27, the Federals <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile {{attempts were made to}} get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew. This Confederate victory frustrated Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's attempts to take Vicksburg by a direct approach.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{walls were}} lowered {{dramatically}} during the war, especially informal policies against hiring women, minorities, and workers over 45 or under 18. (See FEPC) Strikes (except in coal mining) were sharply reduced as unions <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> members to work harder. Tens {{of thousands of}} new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.|$|E
25|$|During the 15th century, Funj herders {{migrated}} {{north to}} Alodia and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at Sennar under Badi II Abu Daqn (c. 16441680). By {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> empire westward to Kordofan. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under Badi IV (1724–1762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by Muhammad Ali (1805–1849), Pasha of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Government {{employees}} {{were forbidden to}} participate in deliberations with the Early Nationalists or attend their meetings. Realising that the growing unity of the Indians posed {{a major threat to}} their rule, the British <b>pushed</b> <b>their</b> policy of divide and rule further. They encouraged Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Raja Shiva Prasad of Benaras (now Varanasi), and other pro-British individuals to start an anti-Early Nationalist movement. They sowed seeds of communalism between the Hindus and the Muslims {{on the one hand and}} between the Indian masses and their leaders on the other. They followed a policy of granting minor concessions to put down the growth of nationalism. However, their policy of repression and hostility only served to make the Early Nationalists more powerful.|$|E
