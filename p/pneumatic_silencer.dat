40|$|Diffused <b>{{pneumatic}}</b> <b>silencer</b> {{has been}} widely used in pneumatic fields because of its small dimensions and high performance on noise reduction. Numerical simulation of its interior and exterior flow field is important to studying the gas flow in the silencer and the flow structure outside the silencer, understanding the mechanism of its noise reduction. Porous media model and Darcy-Forchheimer principle are used as the basic theoretical frame in this paper. The unified governing equations are {{used to describe the}} compressible flow {{in and out of the}} silencer. Robust numerical scheme is used to discritize the equations and the TDBC(Time-dependent boundary conditions) is used to treat the non-reflect boundaries. The detailed structures of the inner and outer flow field of the diffused <b>pneumatic</b> <b>silencer</b> are gotten. The results of the simulation display the characteristics of the flow in the silencer. And the structure of the flow outside the silencer that can be compared with the experimental data is gotten...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>silencer</b> to reduce unpleasantness {{of the noise}} is newly developed in this paper. It is shown that a sound effect of fade-in found by consideration of results from ergonomics is obtained by the silencer. The silencer consists of three kinds of silencers and a device. The device uses artificial muscle utilized a shape memory alloy. It is cleared that sound power level of the silencer is very low...|$|E
50|$|Regarding sound {{generated}} {{inside the}} building, {{there are two}} principal types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Aerodynamic sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion. Noise control for aerodynamic sources include quiet air nozzles, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>silencers</b> and quiet fan technology. Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards, (typically Sound transmission class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.|$|R
40|$|The {{replication}} {{casting process}} {{is used for}} manufacturing open-pore aluminum foams with advanced performances, such as stability and repeatability of foam structure with porosity over 60 %. A simple foam structure model based on the interaction between sodium chloride solid particles poorly wetted by melted aluminum, {{which leads to the}} formation of air pockets (or “air collars”), is proposed for the permeability of porous material. The equation for the minimum pore radius of replicated aluminum foam is derived. According to the proposed model, the main assumption of the permeability model consists in a concentration of flow resistance in a circular aperture of radius rmin. The permeability of aluminum open-pore foams is measured using transformer oil as the fluid, changing the fractions of initial sodium chloride. Measured values of minimum pore size are close to theoretically predicted ones regardless of the particle shape. The expression for the permeability of replicated aluminum foam derived {{on the basis of the}} “bottleneck” model of porous media agrees well with the experimental data. The obtained data can be applied for commercial filter cells and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>silencers...</b>|$|R
