25|$|The {{building}} faced {{having to}} be redesigned in May 2006 because of budgetary shortfalls. On June 27, 2006, the New York Times reported that the overall project had been running $45 million over a $799 million budget, but that the <b>project</b> <b>design</b> will not be further curtailed. The Times had also reported on June 2, 2006, that the overrun {{was due to the}} cost of relocating 148 business and acquiring properties along Broadway where the main building will be located.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} aspect of <b>project</b> <b>design</b> {{is likely to be}} managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the Mary Rose have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.|$|E
25|$|Jack Riley Sr. {{built the}} first model {{with a team of}} four. With {{encouragement}} from Lycoming, the 125hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the <b>project.</b> <b>Design</b> changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened wing spars, that supported engine mounts and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a faired nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.|$|E
25|$|Produced as {{a direct}} {{competitor}} to the luxury sports sedans of the leading European luxury marques, the XE10 series Toyota Altezza and Lexus IS was designed with a greater performance emphasis than typically seen on prior Japanese luxury vehicles. The engineering work was led by Nobuaki Katayama from 1994 to 1998 under the 038T program code, {{who was responsible for}} the AE86 <b>project.</b> <b>Design</b> work by Tomoyasu Nishi was frozen in 1996 and filed under patent number 1030135 on December 5, 1996, at the Japan Patent Office. At its introduction to Japan, it was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Netz Store, until Lexus was introduced to Japan in 2006. The Japan-sold AS200 Altezza sedan and AS300 Altezza Gita formed the basis for the Lexus IS 200 and IS 300 models respectively, sold in markets outside Japan, primarily North America, Australia, and Europe. The Altezza Gita was a hatchback-station wagon version sold in Japan and was known in the US and Europe as the Lexus IS SportCross. The AS300 Altezza Gita was the only Altezza with the 2JZ-GE engine, while in export markets, this engine was available in the sedan models as well, as the Lexus IS300 Sedan.|$|E

25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the <b>project.</b> <b>Design</b> committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E
500|$|The final <b>project</b> <b>design</b> was {{presented}} on February6, 2008, {{in the last}} of five public meetings on the project. Under the plan, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue would be reduced to a two-lane, [...] parkway and named [...] "Sea Breeze Drive". Its signalized intersections with Titus Avenue, Durand Boulevard, and Seneca and Point Pleasant Roads would be converted into roundabouts as part of the reconstruction. Also, the portion of NY590 north of Durand Boulevard would be realigned to meet Culver Road at a new intersection farther west along the lakeshore. The realignment would open up [...] of waterfront land along the shore of Irondequoit Bay that had previously been occupied by the expressway. The town of Irondequoit would then acquire the former right-of-way of NY590 from the state of New York for future recreational uses in a transaction that would officially cost the town $1.|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} research, {{the engineering}} team developed a 4 Ã— 1:16 ratio pulley system where {{each of the}} four corners of the span was connected to two 25-ton winches (bolted to the pavement of the deck). These winches controlled the descent of the main , 608-ton span to a barge anchored [...] below. As part of the <b>project</b> <b>design,</b> the engineering team developed a real-time, computerized, synchronized descent calculator and control program to help each of the two winch management teams ensure that all winches were synchronized at the same [...] per minute descent rate. The operation was executed successfully in [...] hours despite adverse weather conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{software framework}} received the name Cocoa {{for the sake}} of expediency, because the name had already been trademarked by Apple. For many years before this present use of the name, Apple's Cocoa trademark had originated as the name of a multimedia <b>project</b> <b>design</b> application for children. The application was originally developed at the Apple Advanced Technology Group under the name KidSim, and was then renamed and trademarked as [...] "Cocoa". The name, coined by Peter Jensen who was hired to develop Cocoa for Apple, was intended to evoke [...] "Java for kids", as it ran embedded in web pages. [...] The trademark, and thus the name [...] "Cocoa", was re-used to avoid the delay which would have occurred while registering a new trademark for this software framework. [...] The original [...] "Cocoa" [...] program was discontinued at Apple in one of the rationalizations that followed Steve Jobs's return to Apple.

2500|$|When the {{planning}} application for Phase 4 was submitted, {{it was expected}} that construction would commence in July or August 2007. Construction of Phase 3 commenced in July 2007. Bachy Soletanche Ltd, who received the Â£1.5million contract, commenced work on the site by installing a deep contiguous piled wall around the site. The [...] perimeter wall consists of 241 contiguous piles, which were chosen by <b>project</b> <b>design</b> consultant WSP. The piles are [...] in diameter. The piles will hold back the ground that consists of a few metres of fill, then a [...] to [...] thick sand layer which becomes weathered sandstone further down. Because the bedrock slopes from [...] to [...] down across the site, the piles must be up to [...] deep. As excavation on the site commenced, the company installed 70 ground anchors to the wall. Each of the anchors are [...] long and [...] diameter. These are for temporary support of the wall whilst the basement is being constructed. When construction is completed, they will remain. Some of the piles were drilled using a cased Large Diameter Auger (LDA) rotary bored piling method, while other parts of the wall were drilled using the Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) method. Alongside the contiguous piled wall, Bachy Soletanche Ltd also constructed ten [...] diameter LDA plunge column piles and fourteen [...] diameter bearing piles.|$|E
