50|$|The corridos are {{overlapping}} {{call and}} response typical of African singing, and influenced by, and borrowing from the Sambas de Roda of Bahia. Unlike the Mexican Corrido {{which is a}} form of folk ballad, the Bahian corrido is a short song with a usually static response. The chorus is often indicated by being used as the first line in the song:Ai, ai, aidêoiá Joga bonito que eu quero verAi, ai, aidêoiá Joga bonito que eu quero aprenderAi, ai, aidêoiá nossa senhora quem vai me protejerAi, ai, aidê (a girl's name)Play beautifully so I can seePlay beautifully so I can learnOur Lady will protect meThe corrido communicates with the action in the roda (though without the level of interaction in a traditional samba de roda) to inspire the players, to comment directly on the action, invokes, praises, warns, tells stories, and teaches moral values. There is a corrido for welcoming the roda, for closing the roda, asking for the players to play less aggressively, more aggressively, to not grab the other person, and the list continues. Corridos can also be challenges (desafios). The lead will sing a corrido then after some time sing one very similar, requiring the chorus (everyone else save the two playing in the roda) to be paying close attention to sing the correct response or two singers can switch corridos on a certain subject. This use of the corrido in a roda is more rare, requiring a bit more expertise {{on the part of the}} singers than normal. The desafio/challenge can be used with ladainhas as well.The corridos have the broadest melodic variation from one to the next, though many corridos share the same melodies. Thus a vast repertoire of corridos can be learned and improvisation within corridos becomes a less daunting prospect. Like the louvação, the corrido response is sung in unison, and like the louvação an occasional harmonization, usually a third above, is used as a <b>punction</b> by one of the singers.|$|E

40|$|Laser-induced {{thermotherapy}} (LITT) is {{an established}} minimally invasive technique {{which has been}} proven to be successful for many years, especially {{in the treatment of}} liver metastases. On the lung a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of primary and secondary lung tumours is not yet established. For this purpose, the dose-effect relation between an Nd:YAG laser power and the coagulation size attainable was investigated for two different <b>punctioning</b> systems (one for percutaneous treatment and one for open surgery). Secondary, an animal model was developed for further studies on correlations between histological findings and imaging. Finally, histological studies were made on tissue necrosis directly after laser therapy. While the tested intraoperative system proved to be suitable for application with powers up to 32 watts, its maximum efficacy had been reached already at 25 watts and an exposure time of 20 minutes: the volume created was 10, 28 cm 3 ± 2, 24 cm 3. Higher powers did not generate substantially larger lesions, but caused a temperature holdup and subsequent carbonisation. The percutaneous system created bigger lesions, but had a higher risk for large carbonisations. A small animal model on the rat was being established, <b>punctioning</b> the lungs was the most demanding step. Histological examinations directly after laser treatment were made, revealing a zonal structure of the ablated region. A transitional zone between necrosis and normal parenchyma contains vital and non-vital regions. In conclusion, laser-induced-thermotherapy seems to be feasible.

In case that {{surgical}} treatment is necessary, {{as a rule}} it is performed using internal drainage operations. Pancreatic resections are rarely indicated. Case Outline. The authors present a 34 year-old man with a long-lasting history of moderate alcohol consumption in whom an episode of drinking caused an acute-on-chronic pancreatitis so that a 7 cm in diameter cyst was developed inside {{the tail of the}} pancreas causing left subcostal pain, mild pleural effusion and pain in the left shoulder. At operation almost entirely inside the tail of the pancreas a cyst of type II unsuitable for internal drainage operation was found so that a spared resection of the tail of the pancreas and splenectomy were carried out. The post-operative recovery was prolonged due to recurrent left pleural effusion requiring <b>punctions,</b> mild suppurative secretion from the splenic fossa and transient postsplenectomy thrombocytosis.

Material and Methods: A double-blind cross-over clinical study was designed. Fifty-six volunteer students (mean age 23. 1 ± 2. 71 years) of the Dental School at Universidad Austral de Chile (Valdivia, Chile) participated in the study. Subjects were given 0. 9 ml of 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100. 000 epinephrine (Alphacaine®; Nova DFL - Brazil) by two <b>punctions</b> at buccal vestibule of lateral incisor. Warm anesthesia at 42 °C (107. 6 °F) was administered in a hemi-arch; and after one week anesthesia at room temperature (21 °C; 69. 8 °F) and at a standardized speed was administered at the contralateral side.

40|$|Abstract. Heterozygous {{carriers}} of Robertsonian translocations generally {{have a normal}} phenotype but present reproductive failure. In cattle, the t(1; 29) Robertsonian translocation is very common and carriers show a 3 – 5 % decrease in fertility. Some data suggest that female carriers have a higher decrease than male carriers but no direct studies of the chromosome content of oocytes from a t(1; 29) carrier cow have been performed so far. Four heterozygous carrier cows underwent hormonal stimulations and follicles <b>punctions</b> and about 800 oocytes were matured in vitro. Six hundred metaphase II preparations were obtained and analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with bovine chromosome 1 and 29 painting probes. Proportions {{of different kinds of}} oocytes were as-sessed: 74. 11 % (292 / 394) were normal and balanced, 4. 06 % (16 / 394) unbalanced and 21. 83 % (86 / 394) diploid. For all cows, the number of normal oocytes was not significantly different from the number of translocated oocytes but the diploidy and unbalanced rate were significantly different between them. As found in bulls, the meiotic segregation pattern in cows has shown a preponderance of alternate products. However, the frequency of unbalanced gametes determined in females (4. 06 %) was significantly higher than the frequency observed in males (2. 76 %). The divergence in the rate of diploid gametes (0. 04 % vs. 21. 83 %) is mainly explained by the difference between males and females...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is an infrequent, {{but potentially}} life-threatening disease with possible dysautonomic features and respiratory failure as potential complications. There {{are only a}} few previous studies on GBS in Norway. For this reason we did a thirteen year retrospective study including all patients treated for GBS in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), with focus on presence of antecedent infection, presenting clinical features symptoms, diagnostic tools, treatment and complications. Methods: This study included all patients with GBS admitted to the MICU at Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, from the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2013. Results: A total of 32 patients were included. Antecedent infection was detected in over half of our patients, with upper airway infection being the most common. The most frequently presenting symptom in our patients was progressive muscle weakness, typically in a symmetrical, distal to proximal fashion. Over half of our patients had mild sensory disturbances. Signs of dysautonomia were present in over half of our patients. Spinal protein was ultimately found to be increased in 91 % of our patients after recurrent lumbar <b>punctions.</b> Respiratory failure occurred in 41 % of our patients. Complications (especially pneumonia) were almost twice as common in the patient group requiring mechanical ventilation. All patients received treatment with either plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins intravenously (IVIg), sometimes both. IVIg seemed to be first choice in most cases. Conclusions: The primary reason for MICU admission was observation. Almost half of our patients required mechanical ventilation (MV).

E, ainda em outros 2 frangos (7 ª experiência), a refratariedade não foi rompida associando-se a doses peritoneais de 8, 1 x 10 * 6 e 3, 5 x 10 * 7 parasitos, respectivamente, a ministração de dexametasona, seja com o início da droga no mesmo dia da inoculação (0, 4 mg/ 8 doses/ 10 dias), seja com o ínicio da droga 3 dias antes do dia da inoculação (0, 4 mg/ 10 doses/ 12 dias). Nessas 11 aves a refratariedade foi comprovada pela inoculação do sangue em camundongos albinos recém-nascidos (total de 54 inoculaçoes negativas em 301 camundongos); e por 52 xenodiagnósticos negativos (total de 175 larvas e adultos de Triatoma infestans e Panstrongylys megistus). As inoculações e os xenodiagnósticos foram feitos entre 1 hora (h) e 96 h e aos 10, 20 e 30 dias depois da inoculação das aves. (Quadro 1). Portanto, além da refratariedade, ficou demonstrado que os parasitos não passam para o sangue circulante das aves. em 10 frangos (3 ª, 4 ª e 5 ª experiências) inoculados na pele com, 1, 9 x 10 * 6 a 3, 7 x 10 * 6 parasitos, verificou-se a duração da viabilidade dos parasitos nas áreas injetadas.

In experiments {{number one}} and two, four chickens and three pigeons were not infected when subjected to skin inoculations containing parasites doses of 9. 9 X 10 * 5 and 3. 8 X 10 * 6 both from culture plus blood borne forms. In experiment number 6 the refractory state was not broken when two other chickens received {{every other day}} 5 intraperitoneal injections of 2. 8 X 10 * 6 to 6. 1 X 10 * 6 parasites or 5 intraperitoneal injections daily of the parasites from a culture tube suspended in saline plus blood borne forms from 3 infected young mice. The refractory state was not broken also in two chickens from experiment number 7, where dexamethasone was associated to the intraperitoneal parasites doses of 8. 1 X 10 * 6 and 3. 5 X 10 * 7, respectively. This drug was administered either {{on the first day}} (0. 4 mg/ 8 doses/ 10 days) or three days prior to the inoculation (0. 4 mg/ 10 doses/ 12 days). In these 11 birds the refractory state was proven following blood inoculation to newborn albino mice (54 negative inoculations in 301 mice), 52 negative xenodiagnosis tests (175 larvae and adults from Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus megistus). The inoculations and the xenodiagnosis were performed between 1 and 96 hours and on the 10 th, 20 th and 30 th days after the bird were inoculated. Therefore, besides the refractory condition it was alsoshown that the parasites do not enter the peripheral blood. Table 1. In the experiments number 3, 4 and 5, a total of 10 chickens were inoculated in the skin with 1. 8 X 10 * 6 to 3. 6 X 10 * 6 parasites and viable forms were found in the site. In these areas <b>punctions</b> were made every half-anhour and the harvested material inoculated into newborn mice. From 17 inoculations performed within 8 ½ hours, 12 were positive, including the last one; and from 12 performed between 9 and 90 hours (the first four still made every half-and-hour), all were negative. On the other hand, from 10 xenodiagnosis made in the sites of inoculation between hal-and-hour and 9 hours after inoculation, two were positive; and all xenodiagnosis performed between 9 and 90 hours were negative. When 10 xenodiagnosis were repeated in 4 new chickens (experiment number 8) between half-an-hour and 10 hours only 2 were positive (7 and 8 hours). Table 2. The xenodiagnosis under the experimental conditions of this work, as a laboratory diagnostic test, was inferior to the newborn mice inoculation.

This varix is continuous with the pericranial veins of the scalp. We describe a 31 -year-old woman with frontal sinus pericranii treated using an original endovascular technique by transvenous approach combined with direct <b>punction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The echoendoscopic biliary {{drainage}} is {{an option}} to treat obstructive jaundices when ERCP drainage fails. These procedures compose alternative methods {{to the side of}} surgery and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, and it was only possible by the continuous development and improvement of echoendoscopes and accessories. The development of linear setorial array echoendoscopes in early 1990 brought a new approach to diagnostic and therapeutic dimenion on echoendoscopy capabilities, opening the possibility to perform <b>punction</b> over direct ultrasonographic view. Despite of the high success rate and low morbidity of biliary drainage obtained by ERCP, difficulty could be found at the presence of stent tumor ingrown, tumor gut compression, periampulary diverticula, and anatomic variation. The echoendoscopic technique starts performing <b>punction</b> and contrast of the left biliary tree. When performed from gastric wall, the access is made through hepatic segment III. From duodenum, direct common bile duct <b>punction.</b> Dilatation is required before stent introduction, and a plastic or metallic stent is introduced. This phrase should be replaced by: diathermic dilatation of the puncturing tract is required using a 6 F cystostome. The technical success of hepaticogastrostomy is near 98 %, and complications are present in 36 %: pneumoperitoneum, choleperitoneum, infection, and stent disfunction. To prevent bile leakage, we have used the 2 stent techniques, the first stent introduced was a long uncovered metallic stent (8 or 10 [*]cm), and inside this first stent a second fully covered stent of 6 [*]cm was delivered to bridge the bile duct and the stomach. Choledochoduodenostomy overall success rate is 92 % and described complications include, in frequency order, pneumoperitoneum and focal bile peritonitis, present in 19 %. By the last 10 years, the technique was especially performed in reference centers, by ERCP experienced groups, and this seems to be a general guideline to safer procedure execution...|$|E
40|$|The {{important}} and increasing application of aluminum motivated us {{to determine whether}} and in what way does the antioxidative status of erythrocytes in aluminum acute poisoned animals change by studying the metabolism of superoxid dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malonil dialdehyde (MDA). The experiment involved desert mice (gerbils) who received intraperitonally an aluminum chloride solution at a dose of 3. 7 g/kg BM. The experimental groups of animals were sacrified after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours {{from the beginning of}} the experiment by cardial <b>punction</b> or by <b>punction</b> of the abdominal artery. To the control group saline solution was applied. It has been noticed that during the course of the experiment SOD activity increased. We assume this represents a defense mechanism of the organism to increased quantities of free radicals. Further, aluminum considerably reduces the glutathione reductive system capacity affecting its enzymatic component, glutathione reductase which leads to a further decrease in reduced glutathione. The lipid peroxidation index expressed through MDA as an indicator of membrane status remains unchanged. This could mean that malonil dialdehyde is measured in erythrocytes not jet structurally damaged. ...|$|E
40|$|There are studies {{suggesting}} {{that fear of}} blood and injury is associated with less frequent self-testing; by reducing pain when measuring blood glucose the number of measurements can probably increase. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether or not there were any differences regarding pain at different test sites in the palm. Twenty type 1 diabetes subjects pricked themselves at four different sites in the palm in the non-dominant hand in a randomised order with the Freestyle® <b>punction</b> device loaded with BD Microfine+ lancets. Pain was evaluated by the subjects using the Pain-O-Meter®. The result (n= 80) showed no statistically significant difference in pain score between the investigated sites. The level of sensory pain was reported: shooting (n= 36), no pain (n= 27), searing (n= 8), soaring (n= 5), pressing (n= 2), aching (n= 1) and burning (n= 1); 86 % (n= 69) of the pricked sites were experienced as no pain at all. This study shows that pain in connection with capillary blood test is low as measured by the Pain-O-Meter. There are no significant differences in the pain experienced at different sites in the palm. More studies need to be done using different <b>punction</b> devices and more sites need to be investigate...|$|E
40|$|Sternal {{foramina}} are {{a well-known}} variant {{anatomy of the}} sternum and carry the risk of life-threatening complications like pneumothorax or even pericardial/cardial <b>punction</b> during sternal biopsy or acupuncture. There have been numerous studies numerous studies examinimg prevalence of sternal foramina, but {{the study of the}} exact anatomical relationship to intrathoracic structures has received little attention. In a retrospective study of 15 patients with sternal foramina, the topographical anatomy in respect to vital chest organs was examined. In most patients, the directly adjacent structure was the lung (53. 3 %) or mediastinal fat (33. 3 %). Only in three patients, the heart was located directly adjacent to a sternal foramen (20 %). Theoretically, if the needle is inserted deep enough it will at some point perforate the pericardium in all examined patients. There was no correlation between the patient habitus (i. e., thickness of the subcutaneous fat) and the distance to a vital organ. In this sample, pericardial <b>punction</b> would have not occured if the needle is not inserted deeper than 2. 5 [*]cm. Given the preliminary nature of the data, general conclusions of a safe threshold for needle depth should be made with caution. To minimize the risk of hazardous complications, especially with sternal biopsy, preprocedural screening or image guidance is advocated...|$|E
