50|$|Postnatally, the mammary ducts {{elongate}} {{into the}} mammary fat pad. Then, starting around {{four weeks of}} age, mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node. <b>Terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds, the highly proliferative structures found at {{the tips of the}} invading ducts, expand and increase greatly during this stage. This developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds and lasts until an age of about 7-8 weeks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Cheryl Rosenfeld, Biomedical SciencesBlack cohosh is an herbal {{supplement}} {{that can}} alleviate {{the symptoms of}} estrogen related ailments. How black cohosh works is not yet known. Contradicting studies suggest that black cohosh has an estrogenic effect; where as other studies find that black cohosh has little estrogenic effect. What is known is that many plants contain plant estrogens which can be beneficial in the preventative and post treatments of breast cancer. Estrogen regulates cell division in many estrogen sensitive cells. The rate at which cells divide is dependent upon the strength of estrogen. The faster the rate of cell division increases {{the risk that the}} cell will make a mistake in dividing and become cancerous. Plant estrogens are less powerful than human estrogen so the rate of cell division is decreased. In breast cancer, there are groups of cells in the mammary glands known as <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds; this is where estrogen-stimulated cell division occurs. There is some evidence that links the number of <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds to the risk of cancer because of the high rate of cell division and its dependency of estrogen. We hypothesize that dietary black cohosh fed to pre-pubertal female mice would slow the mammary gland development, resulting in fewer <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds. To determine if dietary black cohosh would alter development of the mammary glands, eight female mice weighed and fed daily for 25 days on a black cohosh diet, while another eight were fed a control diet. At completion of the dietary period, the mammary glands were excised and the he number and size of the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds were counted and analyzed for comparison. Our data showed that on average there were more <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds in the black cohosh than in the control. The size of the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> bud on average was smaller in the black cohosh in the control. Based on the data, our hypothesis was incorrect. There {{was no significant difference in}} number or size of the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds in either group. Further study is warranted using younger mice and/or a longer feeding period to determine if black cohosh has an influence on mammary gland development...|$|R

40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was investigated for {{its potential to}} predispose to breast cancer. Analysis of mammary gland differentiation and cell proliferation were used as biomarkers. Timed pregnant Sprague–Dawley CD rats were gavaged with 1 µg TCDD/kg on day 15 post-conception. Control animals were treated with the same volume of vehicle (sesame oil) on the same schedule. Mammary gland differentiation studies revealed that prenatal TCDD treatment, as compared with sesame oil treatment, resulted in significantly more <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds and fewer lobules II in 50 -day-old offspring, but no significant alterations to mammary gland differentiation in 21 -day-old offspring. <b>Terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds are the most susceptible terminal ductal structures and lobules the least susceptible to carcinogenesis. Prenatal TCDD treatment did not alter labeling index in the mammary terminal ductal structures of 21 - and 50 -day-old rats, but the total proliferative compartment in <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds of 50 -dayold rats was larger. Prenatal TCDD treatment resulted in an increased number of chemically induced mammary adenocarcinomas in rats. TCDD delayed time of vaginal opening and caused disruption to the estrous cycle. Alteration to mammary gland differentiation (increased number of <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds) is correlated with increased susceptibility to mammary cancer from prenatal {{exposure to}} TCDD...|$|R

40|$|During puberty, {{the mouse}} mammary gland {{develops}} into a highly branched epithelial network. Owing {{to the absence}} of exclusive stem cell markers, the location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate of mammary stem cells (MaSCs), which drive branching morphogenesis, are unknown. Here we show that morphogenesis is driven by proliferative <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> buds that terminate or bifurcate witwh near equal probability, in a stochastic and time-invariant manner, leading to a heterogeneous epithelial network. We show that the majority of <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> bud cells function as highly proliferative, lineage-committed MaSCs that are heterogeneous in their expression profile and short-term contribution to ductal extension. Yet, through cell rearrangements during <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> bud bifurcation, each MaSC is able to contribute actively to long-term growth. Our study shows that the behaviour of MaSCs is not directly linked to a single expression profile. Instead, morphogenesis relies upon lineage-restricted heterogeneous MaSC populations that function as single equipotent pools in the long term...|$|R

40|$|The alpha subunit of type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent {{protein kinase}} (CAM II kinase-alpha) plays an {{important}} role in longterm synaptic plasticity. We applied preembedding immunocytochemistry (for CAM II kinase-alpha) and postembedding immunogold labeling [for glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ] to explore the subcellular relationships between transmitter-defined axon terminals and the kinase at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in thalamus and cerebral cortex. Many (but not all) axon <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> in asymmetric synapses contained presynaptic CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity; GABAergic <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> in symmetric synapses did not. Postsynaptically, CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity was associated with postsynaptic densities of many (but not all) glutamatergic axon <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> on excitatory neurons. CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity was absent at postsynaptic densities of all GABAergic synapses. The findings show that CAM II kinase-alpha is selectively expressed in subpopulations of excitatory neurons and, to our knowledge, demonstrate for the first time that it is only associated with glutamatergic terminals pre- and postsynaptically. CAM II kinase-alpha is unlikely to play a role in plasticity at GABAergic synapses...|$|R
