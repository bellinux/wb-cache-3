5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), <b>Plecoptera</b> (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek. The creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2013, it received a habitat assessment score of 159 {{on a scale of}} 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (<b>Plecoptera),</b> and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E
5|$|Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{values for}} Kettle Creek have been measured. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{is a method}} of {{determining}} water quality based {{on the presence of}} macroinvertebrate families and their tolerance to pollution. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least polluted. Kettle Creek ranges from 4.61 to 2.54 with an average of 3.32. The EPT Index (Ephemeroptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Trichoptera Index) has also been measured for the creek. It ranges from 10 to 25 with an average of 17. There are 285 vertebrate species that have the potential to inhabit the Kettle Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Numerous macroinvertebrate {{species have}} been {{observed}} in Stafford Meadow Brook, including 18 taxa in the orders Ephemeroptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Trichoptera. In a 210-individual sample, the most common taxa were the genus Hydropsyche (62 individuals), the family Chironomidae (27 individuals), and the genera Amphinemura (23 individuals), Lectura (14 individuals), Hexatoma (11 individuals), and Lanthus (10 individuals). Less common were the genera Baetis and Ephemerella (9 individuals each), Acroneuria (6 individuals), Cheumatopsyche and Rhyacophila (4 individuals each), and Simulium (3 individuals). There were four genera with two individuals each and 13 genera and one order with one individual each.|$|E
5|$|There are 41 macroinvertebrate taxa {{that have}} been {{observed}} in West Creek, more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek. The number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in West Creek at the site WC1 (in the lower reaches of the creek) is nearly 900, which is far higher {{than the number of}} macroinvertebrates per square meter in any other site except the site WC2, in the middle reaches of the creek. Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter. Approximately 60% of the taxa are Ephemeroptera (mayflies), 10% each are <b>Plecoptera</b> (stoneflies), and approximately 5% are Trichoptera (caddisflies).|$|E
5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|E
5|$|Numerous macroinvertebrate {{species have}} been {{observed}} in Spring Brook. A total of 18 genera are from the orders Ephemeroptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Trichoptera. A short distance upstream of the Watres Reservoir, the most common genera taxa were the family Chironomidae and the genera Drunella, Ephemerella, and Hydropsyche. Of a 200-individual sample, 34, 28, 25, and 20 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Slightly less common are the genera Epeorus, Hexatoma, Leuctra, and Lepidostoma.

5|$|Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa {{have been}} {{observed}} in Roaring Brook upstream of the Hollister Reservoir, including 16 genera from the orders Ephemeroptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Trichoptera. In a 212-individual sample, 2 individuals from the family Baetidae, 25 individuals from the family Ephemerellidae, 35 from the family Heptageniidae, 2 from the family Leptophlebiidae, 1 from the family Leuctridae, and 11 from the family Perlidae were observed. Additionally, the sample included 5 individuals from the family Glossosomatidae, 61 from the family Hydropsychidae, 5 from the family Philopotamidae, 1 from the family Polycentropodidae, 4 from the family Rhyacophilidae, and 2 from the family Uenoidae. Additionally, there was 1 individual from the family Elmidae, 5 from the family Psephenidae, 3 from the family Corydalidae, 1 from the family Aeshnidae, 42 from the family Chironomidae, 5 from the family Tipulidae, and 1 from the family Cambaridae.|$|E
5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In <b>Plecoptera</b> the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal fold. The vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third axillary like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in <b>Plecoptera</b> and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third axillary sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most of the fan areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, but even in such cases the flexed wing may bend along a line between the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (<b>Plecoptera)</b> and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and <b>Plecoptera),</b> each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so different from one another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means {{that one of the most}} interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E
25|$|Macroinvertebrates {{began to}} repopulate Carbon Run by the 2000s {{due to the}} passive {{treatment}} systems in the watershed. In the 1990s, three individuals from the genus Tipula, an individual from the family Rhyacophilidae, and an individual from the order <b>Plecoptera</b> were observed in the stream upstream of Scarlift Discharge 42. A small unnamed tributary to Carbon Run hosted various caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, and minnows. However, immediately downstream of Scarlift Discharge 42, no macroinvertebrates were observed.|$|E

25|$|During this time, many of {{the species}} from the Carboniferous diversified, and many new orders developed, including: Protelytroptera, {{primitive}} relatives of <b>Plecoptera</b> (Paraplecoptera), Psocoptera, Mecoptera, Coleoptera, Raphidioptera, and Neuroptera. The last four being the first definitive records of the Holometabola. By the Pennsylvanian and well into the Permian, {{by far the most}} successful were primitive Blattoptera, or relatives of cockroaches. Six fast legs, two well-developed folding wings, fairly good eyes, long, well-developed antennae (olfactory), an omnivorous digestive system, a receptacle for storing sperm, a chitin skeleton that could support and protect, as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts, gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals. About 90% of insects were cockroach-like insects ("Blattopterans"). The dragonflies Odonata were the dominant aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata appeared in the Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, go back to the Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm.|$|E
500|$|A {{location}} on West Branch Fishing Creek downstream {{of the community}} of Elk Grove is one of two places in the watershed of upper Fishing Creek where the stream bed is more than 60% covered by benthic algae. The high population of algae here is possibly due to leaking septic tanks in the area. In Elk Grove, there are between 100 and 200 aquatic macroinvertebrates per square meter in the creek. Further upstream, there are nearly 300 aquatic macroinvertebrates per square meter. At the headwaters of the creek, approximately 25% of the macroinvertebrate taxa belong to the order <b>Plecoptera,</b> about 25% belong to the order Ephemeroptera, approximately 25% belong to the order Trichoptera, about 20% belong to the order Chironomidae, and roughly 5% belong to other orders. At the creek's mouth, approximately 20% of the macroinvertebrate taxa are in the order <b>Plecoptera,</b> approximately 55% belong to the order Ephemeroptera, roughly 20% [...] are in the orders Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Approximately 5% are in other orders.|$|E
500|$|Puerto Rico's insect fauna, {{similar to}} the {{majority}} of major invertebrate taxa in the archipelago, is considered [...] when compared to its mainland counterparts. For example, approximately 300 species of butterfly occur in Puerto Rico, in contrast to more than 600 species in Trinidad and more than 1,500 species documented from a 7.5km2 region in Brazil. As of 1998, out of the estimated 925,000 described insect species, only 5,573 were documented from Puerto Rico. In terms of diversity, of the 31 extant insect orders, 27 have representatives in Puerto Rico. The orders without reported representatives are Microcoryphia, Grylloblattaria, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Mecoptera. The largest insect depository in Puerto Rico resides at the Museo de Entomología y Biodiversidad Tropical (Museum of Entomology and Tropical Biodiversity), part of the Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico.|$|E
500|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about [...] in England and Australia, and {{comprises}} about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are {{not found in the}} earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, veined tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now. The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera. These insects, which resemble modern Blattodea, or cockroaches owing to shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from Protelytroptera to Dermaptera took place. The most likely, and most closely resembling, related order of insects is Grylloblattaria, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmida, Embioptera, <b>Plecoptera,</b> and Dictyoptera.|$|E

2500|$|Indiana bats feed {{exclusively}} on terrestrial and aquatic flying insects. The most common prey items taken by Indiana bats are moths (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and mosquitoes and midges (Diptera). Selection of prey {{depends largely on}} availability in the foraging habitat with diet varying seasonally, by reproductive status of females, and from night to night. In southern Michigan, Indiana bats primarily ate caddisflies (Trichoptera) and bees, wasps, and ants (Hymenoptera), {{in addition to the}} more common prey previously listed. In the Ozarks of southern Missouri, the bats also primarily ate bees, wasps, ants, moths, and beetles as well as leafhoppers (Homoptera), although diet did vary throughout the summer. [...] Bats in Indiana were found to prefer beetles, moths, mosquitoes, midges, leafhoppers, and wasps. Other arthropod groups which are consumed by Indiana bats in very limited quantities are lacewings (Neuroptera), spiders (Araneae), stoneflies (<b>Plecoptera),</b> mayflies (Ephemeroptera), mites and ticks (Acari), and lice (Phthiraptera).|$|E
2500|$|The anal-genital {{part of the}} abdomen, {{known as}} the terminalia, {{consists}} generally of segments 8 or 9 to the abdominal apex. Segments 8 and 9 bear the genitalia; segment 10 is visible as a complete segment in many [...] "lower" [...] insects but always lacks appendages; and the small segment 11 is represented by a dorsal epiproct and pair of ventral paraprocts derived from the sternum. A pair of appendages, the cerci, articulates laterally on segment 11; typically these are annulated and filamentous but have been modified (e.g. the forceps of earwigs) or reduced in different insect orders. An annulated caudal filament, the median appendix dorsalis, arises {{from the tip of}} the epiproct in apterygotes, most mayflies (Ephemeroptera), and a few fossil insects. A similar structure in nymphal stoneflies (<b>Plecoptera)</b> is of uncertain homology. These terminal abdominal segments have excretory and sensory functions in all insects, but in adults there is an additional reproductive function.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest known insect {{that resembles}} species of Coleoptera {{date back to}} the Lower Permian (...) , though they instead have 13-segmented antennae, elytra with more fully {{developed}} venation and more irregular longitudinal ribbing, and an abdomen and ovipositor extending beyond the apex of the elytra. The oldest true beetle would have features that include 11-segmented antennae, regular longitudinal ribbing on the elytra, and having genitalia that are internal. The earliest beetle-like species had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia. The later had expanded parapronotal lobes, a large ovipositor, and forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera. The orders Raphidioptera and Neuroptera are grouped together as Neuropterida. The one family of putative Raphidiopteran clade (Sojanoraphidiidae) has been controversially placed as so. Although the group had a long ovipositor distinctive to this order and a series of short crossveins, however with a primitive wing venation. Early families of <b>Plecoptera</b> had wing venation consistent with the order and its recent descendants. Psocoptera was first appeared in the Permian period, they are often regarded as the most primitive of the hemipteroids.|$|E
