The presence of vegetation, either original or added between scanning periods, has been found to dramatically effect the range of signatures in a given area. Different land use developmental stages have been successfully identified by means of 1 : 50, 000 scale <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photography,</b> a resolution only considered possible by spaceborne instrumentation with the advent of the Landsat D satellite. Textural information generated through the grey-tone spatial-dependency matrix for the Landsat band 5 data is compared for different years and a change detection algorithm is described. It is found that the addition of vegetation during development after the removal of natural vegetation resulted in error of omission in the single band data, which must therefore only be used in concert with other data sources...|$|R

The orange portion of the visible spectrum was used in analyzing the May and June data to cluster relative radiance of the soils into eight different radiance levels. The reflective infrared spectral band was used in analyzing the August and September data to cluster maize into different spectral categories.

Recommendation domains are used in farming systems research (FSR) for agricultural research and development initiatives enabling greater participation from rural producers within the development process. Recommendation domains are defined by agricultural potential (agro-ecological zones) and farming systems (agro-economic groupings). A multilevel approach incorporating Landsat MSS data, 1 : 50, 000 stereo <b>panchromatic</b> air <b>photography,</b> large scale aerial colour slide photography and ground surveys is used {{to collect data on}} the farming systems of the study area. Relatively homogeneous farming patterns are identified and mapped using a number of different computer software packages. These patterns are related to previously identified zones of agricultural potential (agro-ecological zones) to define recommendation domains for new agricultural development initiatives in the area. Several domains are identified for specific attention. Recommendations are made which are relevant to both national and district level agricultural planning in Kenya. It is suggested that future development programmes should focus on areas undergoing population movement and cultivation change since without careful planning these changes are likely to detrimentally affect the local farming systems and natural environment...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{has used}} remote sensing (RS) for many decades. Starting in the 1930 s with <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photography</b> for {{farmland}} and soil surveying, RS applications to agriculture expanded greatly with {{the invention of}} ordinary color and color infrared (CIR) films. The Landsat program brought digital optical RS to some sectors of agriculture on a global scale. Information extraction based on changes over time became possible with the frequent and regular revisit nature of spacecraft-based RS like Landsat. In the AgRISTARS Program, NASA used Landsat to explore multispectral (MS) RS for crop identification and yield assessment for major global crops. The importance of temporal signatures became obvious through this effort. The Thematic Mapper (Landsats 4 - 5 and soon, Landsat 7 ’s ETM+) expanded global MS RS to include middle infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) bands. Aircraft-based MS RS systems have continued {{to be the primary}} sensors for agriculture. Digital color, CIR & TIR cameras now allow quick delivery of RS images and related information products to agribusiness with high resolution on a weekly basis. In the near future, great advances will likely occur. MS RS at 4 -m resolution will soon be available from space. Hyperspectral RS will be available in some regions. Spacecraft-based multiparameter SAR will cover areas that have historically been denied to optical RS due to cloudiness. These new capabilities will bear on many agribusiness interests heretofore not well served including precision farming, crop risk insurance, and ag-related financial institutions...|$|R
40|$|For landscapes {{dominated}} by agriculture, land cover {{plays an important}} role in the balance between anthropogenic and natural forces. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to describe two different methodologies that have been implemented to create high-resolution land cover classifications in a dominant agricultural landscape. First, an object-based segmentation approach will be presented, which was applied to historic, high resolution, <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photography.</b> Second, a traditional per-pixel technique was applied to multi-temporal, multispectral, high resolution aerial photography, in combination with light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and independent component analysis (ICA). A critical analysis of each approach will be discussed in detail, as well as the ability of each methodology to generate landscape metrics that can accurately characterize the quality of the landscape. This will be done through the comparison of various landscape metrics derived from the different classifications approaches, with a goal of enhancing the literature concerning how these metrics vary across methodologies and across scales. This is a familiar problem encountered when analyzing land cover datasets over time, which are often at different scales or generated using different methodologies. The diversity of remotely sensed imagery, including varying spatial resolutions, landscapes, and extents, as well as the wide range of spatial metrics that can be created, has generated concern about the integrity of these metrics when used to make inferences about landscape quality. Finally, inferences will be made about land cover and land cover change dynamics for the state of Iowa based on insight gained throughout the process...|$|R

Army Corps of Engineers and Texas Agricultural Experiment Station (TAES/ 03 -PL- 02 : Modification No. 3) {{on behalf of the}} Paso del Norte Watershed Council. Tasks accomplished in this phase include (a) assessment of data availability for expansion of the URGWOM model, identification of data gaps, generation of data needed from historic data using empirical methods, compilation and verification of the water quality data for reaches between the Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico and Fort Quitman, Texas; (b) development of the RiverWare physical model for the Rio Grande flow for the selected reaches between Elephant Butte Reservoir and El Paso, beginning with a conceptual model for interaction of surface water and groundwater in the Rincon and Mesilla valleys, and within the limits of available data; and (c) implementation of data transfer interface between the coordinated database and hydrologic models. This Project was conducted by researchers at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and New Mexico State University (NMSU) under the direction of Zhuping Sheng of TAMU and J. Phillip King of New Mexico State University. It was developed to enhance the coordinated database, which was originally developed by the Paso del Norte Watershed Council with support of El Paso Water Utilities to fulfill needs for better management of regional water resources and to expand the Upper Rio Grande Water Operations Model (URGWOM) to cover the river reaches between Elephant Butte Dam, New Mexico and Fort Quitman, Texas. In Phases I and II of this Project (TAES/ 03 -PL- 02), hydrological data needed for flow model development were compiled and data gaps were identified and a conceptual model developed. The objectives of this phase were to develop a physical model of the Rio Grande flow between Elephant Butte Dam and American Dam by using data collected in the first development phase of the PdNWC/Corps Coordinated Water Resources Database and to enhance the data portal capabilities of the PdNWC Coordinated Database Project. This report is Part III of a three part completion report for Phase III and provides information on water sources, uses, and GIS of the canals and ditches of the Valle de Ju?rez Irrigation District 009 (ID 009) in the Ju?rez Lower Valley, Chihuahua, M?xico. The author explains that the water needs of this region have changed in recent years from being primarily for agricultural purposes to domestic and industrial uses currently. Also, the United States wanted to assess and identify new data sources on a GIS format for the Mexican side. Therefore, this project produced several maps with the location of channels and ditches along the Valle de Ju?rez Irrigation District. This information also will support water planning of the Valle de Ju?rez Irrigation District 009. The maps were produced from existing digital data regarding water resources and by adding thematic layers such as soil salinity and soil texture from analog maps. ASTER satellite imagery and official <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photography</b> were used to produce the maps...|$|R
40|$|Invasive plants pose serious {{threats to}} economic, social and {{environmental}} interests throughout the world. Developing strategies for their management requires a range of information that is often impractical to collect from ground based surveys. In other cases, such as retrospective analyses of historical invasion rates and patterns, data is rarely, if ever, available from such surveys. Instead, historical archives of remotely sensed imagery provides {{one of the only}} existing records, and are used in this research to determine invasion rates and reconstruct invasion patterns of a ca 70 year old exotic mesquite population (Leguminoseae: Prosopis spp.) in the Pilbara Region of Western Australia, thereby helping to identify ways to reduce spread and infill. A model was then developed using this, and other, information to predict which parts of the Pilbara are most a risk. This information can assist in identifying areas requiring the most vigilant intervention and pre-emptive measures. Precise information of the location and areal extent of an invasive species is also crucial for land managers and policy makers for crafting management strategies aimed at control, confinement or eradication of {{some or all of the}} population. Therefore, the third component of this research was to develop and test high spectral and spatial resolution airborne imagery as a potential monitoring tool for tracking changes at various intervals and quantifying the effectiveness of management strategies adopted. To this end, high spatial resolution digital multispectral imagery (4 channels, 1 m spatial resolution) and hyperspectral imagery (126 channels, 3 m spatial resolution) was acquired and compared for its potential for distinguishing mesquite from coexisting species and land covers. These three modules of research are summarised hereafter. To examine the rates and patterns of mesquite invasion through space and time, canopies were extracted from a temporal series of <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photography</b> over an area of 450 ha using unsupervised classification. Non-mesquite trees and shrubs were not discernible from mesquite using this imagery (or technique) and so were masked out using an image acquired prior to invasion. The accuracy of the mesquite extractions were corroborated in the field and found to be high (R 2 = 0. 98, P 36 m 2 (66 - 94 %) with both approaches and image types. However, both approaches used on the hyperspectral imagery were more reliable at capturing patches > 36 m 2 than the DMSI using either approach. The lowest omission and commission rates were obtained using pairwise separation on the hyperspectral imagery, which was significantly more accurate than DMSI using an overall separation approach (Z= 2. 78, P 36 m 2. However, hyperspectral imagery processed using pairwise separation appears to be superior, even though not statistically different to hyperspectral imagery processed using overall separation or DMSI processed using pairwise separation at the 95 % confidence level. Mapping smaller patches may require the use of very high spatial resolution imagery, such as that achievable from unmanned airborne vehicles, coupled with a hyperspectral instrument. Alternatively, management may continue to rely on visual airborne surveys flown at low altitude and speed, which have proven to be capable at mapping small and isolated mesquite shrubs in the study area used in this research...|$|R
40|$|A presente pesquisa constitui uma contribuição para o conhecimento das características geológicas e estruturais de uma região tectonicamente complexa e estruturalmente desconhecida em grande parte. Os estudos realizados objetivaram fundamentalmente estabelecer as principais fases deformacionais na região da represa de Furnas (MG), utilizando imagens fotográficas do sistema LANDSAT e fetografias aéreas pancromáticas. A abordagem metodológica está voltada para a exploração dos atributos espaciais das imagens, através de uma adequação de critérios fotointerpretativos que permitisse de umamaneira sistemática e codificada, analisar os principais elementos morfoestruturais (de relevo e drenagem), interpretar o significado estrutural destes elementos e estabelecer relações geométricas entre as estruturas geológicas e as fases deformacionais. Através dos estilos deformacionais, da {{magnitude}} das estruturas diagnósticas e dos elementos estruturais (foliações e lineações) puderam-se reconhecer na área quatro importantes fases deformacionais. A primeira fase (restrita às rochas da Unidade Araxá) é caracterizada por uma intensa foliação de transposição, com dobras sem vergência definida e traços axiais próximos a EW. A segunda fase, a mis expressiva, exibe grandes dobramentos recumbentes vergentes para Leste, Com xistosidade de fluxo bem proeminente. A geometria das dobras menores desta segunda fase é bem variável, o mesmo acontecendo com seus traços axiais e eixos que variam entre NS e WNW devido aos efeitos provocados pelos falhamentos da fase seguinte. A terceira fase deformacional corresponde a um episódio de grandes rupturas com a formação de zonas de cisalhamento de direção NW, constituídas por um conjunto de sistemas de falhas transcorrentes, inversas e/ou de empurrão e complexas (transcorrências associadas com empurrões). A quarta fase deformacional representa uma mudança completa de estilo, dando lugar a) dobramentos flexurais amplos com dimensões quilométricas, os quais são responsáveis pelas principais estruturas sinformes e antiformes encontradas na área, com direção N 60 - 70 W. Outras estruturas menos marcantes foram mapeadas, principalmente nas porções leste da área. Constituem-se de juntas, falhas e amplas flexuras NS que podem pertencer a uma outra fase deformacional, ou representar estruturas resultantes dos efeitos dos falhamentos da terceira fase deformacional. A superposição destas fases deformacionais deu origem a estruturas superimpostas com figuras de interferências complexas. Estas figuras são verdadeiros diagnósticos da geometria e do posicionamento das estruturas formadas na segunda e na quarta fase deformacional. Finalmente, os estilos deformacionais da região da represa de Furnas permitem concluir que a estruturação da região foi marcada, em tempos Pré Brasilianos, por uma tectônica épidérmicad́o tipo de escoamento (que deu origem às estruturas do tipo ńappe de charriage) ́. Esta tectônica é bem caracterizada pelas Unidades Araxá e Canastra, as quais consituem unidades alóctones transportadas de oeste para leste. Já em tempos Brasilianos, sob o mesmo regime de esforços, a tectônica foi inicialmente embasamento, e este, por sua vez, deslocou as coberturas metassedimentares (Araxá, Canastra e Bambuí) de uma forma escalonada de NW para SE, o que ocasionou ámarrotamentosńestas coberturas com intensidades variáveis. Uma mudança no regime de esforços fez surgir as grandes flexuras NW seguidas das NS que são atualmente responsáveis pelos grandes sinformes e antiformes encontrados na área. Os produtos de sensoriamentoremoto, principalmente as imagens TM (Thematic Mapper) do LANDSAT aliada às fotografias aéreas pancromáticas, mostraram-se de grande valia na definição do arcabouço estrutural e regional e forneceram informações essenciais para a compreensão das principais estruturas) menores, originadas nas diversas fases deformacionais. The {{present research}} is {{a contribution to}} the knowledge of the geological and structural characteristics of a tectonically complex and, in great part, structurally unknown region. The studies aim at fundamentally to stablish the main deformational phases that occurred in the Furnas (MG) dam region, using photographic images from the LANDSAT system and <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photographies.</b> The methodological approach deals with the images special attributes exploration through and adequacy of photointerpretative criteria which would permit, in a systematic and codified manner, to analyse the main morphostructural elements (relief and drainage), interpret the structural meaning of these elements and establish geometric relations between the geologic structures and deformational phases. Through the deformational styles, the magnitude of the diagnostic structures and the structural elements (foliations and lineations), four important deformational styles could be recognized in the area. The first phase (restricted to the Araxa Unit rocks) is characterized by an intense transposition foliation with folds without defined vergency and axial traces next to EW. The second phase, the most expressive, exibits great recumbent folding vergent to east with a rather proeminent flow cleavage. The second phase minor folds geometry is quite variable, the same happening with their axial traces and axis which vary from NS and WNW due to the effects caused by faults in the next phase. The third deformational phase corresponds to an episode of great ruptures with the formation of shear zones with NW direction composed by a group of transcurrent fault systems, inverse and/or of trust and complex (transcurrencies associated with thrust). The fourth deformational phase represents a complete change in style, giving place to vast flexural folds of kilometrical dimensions which are responsible for the main synform and antiform structures found in the area with N 60 - 70 W direction. Other less marking structures were mapped mainly in the east portion of the area. They constitute joints, faults and vast NS flexures which may belong to another deformational phase or represent structures resulting from the effects of the fault in the third deformational phase. The superposing of these deformational phases originated superimposed structures with complex interference figures which are a true diagnosis of the positioning geometry of the structures formed in the second and fourth deformational phases. Finally, the deformational styles of the Furnas dam region permit to conclude that the regionś structuring was marked in Pre-Brazilian times by a superficial tectonics of the flow type (that originated the structures of the n̈appe de charriageẗype). This tectonics is well-characterized by the Araxá and Canastra Units which constitute allochthonous units transported from west to east. Already in Brazilian times and under the same stress regime, the tectonics was initially rigid (ductile-ruptile) and originated the shear zones which fragmented the embasement which, by its turn, displaced the metasedimentary covers (Araxá, Canastra and Bambuí) in a staggered form from NW to SE, causing c̈rumplingsïn these covers with variable intensities. A change in the stress regime forced the appearance of great NW flexures followed by the NS ones, which are nowadays responsible for the great synforms and antiforms found in the area. Remote sensing products, mainly the TM (Thematic Mapper) images from LANDSAT, together with <b>panchromatic</b> aerial <b>photographies,</b> proved to be of great value in defining the regionś structural skeleton. They also furnished essential information for the comprehension of the main minor structures originated in the several deformational phases...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the Intermountain West {{there has}} been a {{substantial}} reduction in both {{the quantity and quality of}} sagebrush ecosystems. To ass ist current range management objectives, numerous efforts have been made to classify and map sagebrush communities using remotely sensed data. However, the amount of deta il provided by these broad-scale mapping projects is often limited. This research evaluated the ability of a suite of airborne and satellite imagery to detect sagebrush community structural attributes, specifically percent canopy cover, live cover, density, size-vigor, and spatial arrangement of shrubs. Field data was collected at Camp Williams National Guard Training Facility near Bluffdale, Utah, within a Wyoming big sagebrush community. High-resolution color infrared (CIR) aerial <b>photography,</b> <b>panchromatic,</b> and multi-spectral satellite imagery, including data from Orb image, IKO OS, and Landsat ETM+, were used. Comparisons were made based on the inherent spatial and spectral properties of each image. In addition to the traditional pixel-based method for classifying imagery, a relatively new object-oriented approach to measure sagebrush cover was also explored. Results indicate that the quantification of sagebrush cover can be done fairly accurately in mid-level canopy cover areas regardless of the imagery used. Confidence in the cover estimates did diminish slightly in areas where sagebrush cover was relatively sparse or extremely dense. Not all structural variables were quantifiable using the coarser imagery, due to constraints of spat ial resolution. In these instances the 0. 3 -meter CIR imagery was exemplified. The object-oriented approach enabled an automatic delineation of the range of variability within sagebrush stands and provided an interesting alternative to measuring sagebrush community structural attributes when compared with the more traditional pixel-based approach. This research was intended to provide a resource for anyone working wi thin sagebrush ecosystems, including rangeland managers, wildlife biologists, or other remote sensors, specifically when decisions related to the appropriate selection of remotely sensed data for some intended management application is necessary. The evaluation of wildlife habitat for sagebrush-obligate species, the direction of fire management strategies and restoration efforts, and the ident ification of appropriate grazing areas are only a few of the potential applications of this wor...|$|R
40|$|Bangladesh is a low-lying flood prone deltaic plain. Excavations {{are needed}} to create raised land for safe flood-free homesteads and water bodies for irrigation, and these result in the {{creation}} of doba, pukur, dighi and jola. All of these types of small water bodies are almost equally distributed all over the country, except for the heel, which is a natural, saucer shaped depression. For every eight people there is approximately an acre of small water bodies, which range in size from 25 - 400 sq. m. (doba), 150 - 1000 sq. m. (pukur), > 750 sq. m. (dighi), > 2000 sq. m. (jola) and > 1000 sq. m. (heel). These small water bodies are commonly used for drinking, bathing and washing, fisheries and aquaculture, duck raising, irrigation, cattle feeding and washing. Despite the importance of small water bodies to the local economy there is no up to date inventory. For this purpose, in my research I have employed integrated participatory remote sensing, GIS and socio-cultural approaches. Although these have not been used before in Bangladesh, 1 argue that they are ideal for effective resource management and sustainable development planning. This research investigated the historical development of the present spatial distribution and use patterns of SWB using Remote Sensing and GIS. This was at a regional scale in four mouzas of Shahjadpur Thana. The data sources were topographical maps, aerial photographs, satellite images, agricultural census data, in-depth questionnaire, focus group meetings and interviewing key informants. An integrated RS-GIS and social sciences methodology was employed to produce maps of change and overlays of the socio-cultural factors involved. Results show that the doba, pukur and dighi, when these are not obstructed by surrounding vegetation, can be detected easily in high resolution <b>panchromatic</b> CORONA satellite <b>photography,</b> IRS-ID <b>Panchromatic</b> image and aerial photography. Comparatively large pukurs, dighis and all jo las and heels are detected in all other optical sensors and the SIR-C radar imagery. Multi-temporal images are helpful for identifying the different types of small water bodies as well separating those from other seasonal large water bodies and flooded areas. It is hoped that the proposed computer assisted participatory management system, including some locally specific guidelines, may be applicable for the planning of other thanas (total 490) in Bangladesh. The proposed management system will facilitate the integration of local planning with the national level planning process, which has not been possible hitherto.
