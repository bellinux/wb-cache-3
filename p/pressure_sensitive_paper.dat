40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} static {{upper eyelid}} pressure and {{contact with the}} ocular surface {{in a group of}} young adult subjects. Methods Static upper eyelid pressure was measured for 11 subjects using a piezoresistive pressure sensor attached to a rigid contact lens. Measures of eyelid pressure were derived from an active pressure cell (1. 14 mm square) beneath the central upper eyelid margin. To investigate the contact region between the upper eyelid and ocular surface, we used <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> and the lissamine-green staining of Marx’s line. These measures combined with the pressure sensor readings were used to derive estimates of eyelid pressure. Results The mean contact width between the eyelids and ocular surface estimated using <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> was 0. 60 ± 0. 16 mm, while the mean width of Marx’s line was 0. 09 ± 0. 02 mm. The mean central upper eyelid pressure was calculated to be 3. 8 ± 0. 7 mmHg (assuming that the whole pressure cell was loaded), 8. 0 ± 3. 4 mmHg (derived using the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> imprint widths) and 55 ± 26 mmHg (based on contact widths equivalent to Marx’s line). Conclusions The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> measurements suggest that a band of the eyelid margin, significantly larger than the anatomical zone of the eyelid margin known as Marx’s line, has primary contact with the ocular surface. Using these measurements as the contact between the eyelid margin and ocular surface, we believe that the mean pressure of 8. 0 ± 3. 4 mmHg is the most reliable estimate of static upper eyelid pressure...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the wear of machinery during the rice milling process. Two machines have been studied in detail (which combined constitute “milling”). Background literature has been studied and further added to such that machine improvements can be made relating to both capacity and component wear life. The first part of the work undertaken considers material properties of rice grains in their various forms and machine components with which contact is made. Dimension measurements and SEM imagery have highlighted the organic nature of rice grains as an abrasive, and observations of the change in properties from pre to post process made. Mass change, grain profiles, coefficient of friction, grain hardness and compressive strength have all been measured. Wear observations of husking and polishing components has revealed similarities with known wear mechanisms. Microscopy and profilometry have shown the areas which are susceptible to increased wear rates whilst measurement of scratch angles has illustrated the motion of grains through the polisher. Small scale testing has been {{a key part of the}} research due to the impractically high capacity of full scale machines. Husking tests have established that the shear stress required to achieve a given husked ratio is constant suggesting that a harder rubber with the same coefficient of friction as a softer rubber will husk more efficiently. Fast capture camera footage of husking experiments has shown that grains rotate between the rubber counterfaces before husking which effectively creates a region of high pressure at either end of the grain. It has also revealed that grains maintain their initial contact with the slow roller whilst sliding against the fast roller once husked. Probable mechanisms for this effect have been determined and experiments have been conducted showing that the uneven wear created by the effect could be minimised by axial vibration of the slow roller. Small scale polishing experiments have been used to reveal the locations of the highest wear (through paint test) which have a pattern consistent with an uneven fill by the grains entering the polishing chamber or a resonance of the screens caused by cage spacing. High wear was noted at inlet thought to be a result of rapid scattering of grains on entry from the feed screw. <b>Pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> has been used to determine contact pressure profiles for various stages and conditions in the polishing chamber and laser vibrometry has been used to observe the effect of loading on machine vibration. Computer simulations have been developed to simulate grain flow and have shown good compatibility with the physical experiments. This leads to the potential to use such methods for future machine design. Finally, this thesis covers the potential for further work along with how the work is best suited for industrial implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} biomechanical devices is often {{difficult}} {{because it is not}} feasible to test them within human or animal patients. Initial designs may be tested using mechanical rigs or finite element models to simulate the complex loading conditions within biological environments. Recent advances in computer technology have allowed computer simulations to become more detailed. However, educated assumptions must be made to simplify the conditions that will effect the device. Highly accurate results can be obtained but it is essential that these results are verified using a mechanical test rig. This will identify if human error or inaccurate assumptions have occurred. Mechanical test rigs were designed to simulate the forces acting within four different biomechanical systems. This involved simulating the forces applied to the lumbar spine, the greater trochanter of the hip, and to the shin; for the testing of inter-vertebral cages, hip protectors and floor coverings, and shin pads respectively. Load cells were used to measure the resultant impact forces applied to the hip and shin. The time-domain data were recorded for each impact and from these data it was possible to calculate the maximum impact force and the total energy absorbed by the greater trochanter. Mechanical testing of intervertebral cages involved <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> to measure resultant pressure trends at the interface between the vertebral end plate and the cages. This instantly revealed pressure trends and computer programs were written to determine the contact area, calibrate pressure values, and to allow the improved visualisation of results. Results from the mechanical test rigs are also suitable for validation of finite element analysis studies. New information has been generated to improve understanding about the pressure trends under intervertebral cages and the key design features have been identified. The hip test rig was used in the design of a novel hip protector, to determine the role of floor coverings in an impact, and to compare numerous hip protectors using typical impact conditions. Results show that a combination of energy absorbent flooring with a hip protector is the best environment for a reduced risk of a hip fracturing. Design recommendations were made regarding the material composition and the thickness of the materials used. This allowed the novel hip protector to be designed as small as possible but still sufficiently reduces the impact force from a person falling onto their hip. The hip test rig was modified to simulate the shin and was used to compare several commercially available shin guards. New information was generated to identify which design features are best to reduce impact forces. Further developments have been made to the first version of the hip impact test rig. The latest version of this hip test rig is currently being used as a benchmark for all hip protectors and is a likely contender as the basis of a standard testing system for a European Standard.

The acrylate <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesives are simple and less pollution, so more and more companies pay attention on this kind of binder.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} static {{pressures on the}} stator vane suction side of a high-speed single stage fan using the technique of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint (PSP). The paper illustrates development in application of the relatively new experimental technique to the complex environment of internal flows in turbomachines. First, there is a short explanation of the physics of the PSP technique and a discussion of calibration methods for <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint in the turbomachinery environment. A description of the image conversion process follows. The recorded image of the stator vane pressure field is skewed due to the limited optical access and must be converted to the meridional plane projection for comparison with analytical predictions.

40|$|Pyrene-based <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paints (PSP) {{have certain}} {{advantages}} {{due to their}} high pressure sensitivity and low temperature coefficient but their major drawback is the paint degradation under wind tunnel conditions.

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{paint is}} a newly-developed optical {{measurement}} technique with {{which one can}} get a continuous pressure distribution in much shorter time and lower cost than a conventional pressure tap measurement. However, most of the current <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint applications are restricted to steady pressure measurement at high speeds {{because of the small}} signal-to-noise ratio at low speed and a slow response to pressure changes. In the present study, three phases of work have been completed to extend the application of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique to low-speed testing and to investigate the applicability of the paint technique to unsteady flow. First the measurement system using a commercially available PtOEP/GP- 197 <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was established and applied to impinging jet measurements. An in-situ calibration using only five pressure tap data points was applied and the results showed good repeatability and good agreement with conventional pressure tap measurements on the whole painted area. The overall measurement accuracy in these experiments was found to be within 0. 1 psi. The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique was then applied to low-speed wind tunnel tests using a 60 deg delta wing model with leading edge blowing slots. The technical problems encountered in low-speed testing were resolved by using a high grade CCD camera and applying corrections to improve the measurement accuracy. Even at 35 m/s, the paint data not only agreed well with conventional pressure tap measurements but also clearly showed the suction region generated by the leading edge vortices. The vortex breakdown was also detected at alpha= 30 deg. It was found that a pressure difference of 0. 2 psi was required for a quantitative pressure measurement in this experiment and that temperature control or a parallel temperature measurement is necessary if thermal uniformity does not hold on the model. Finally, the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was applied to a periodically changing pressure field with a 12. 8 s time period. A simple first-order pole model was applied to deal with the phase lag of the paint. The unsteady pressure estimated from the time-changing <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint data agreed well with the pressure transducer data in regions of higher pressure and showed the possibility of extending the technique to unsteady pressure measurements. However, the model still needs further refinement based on the physics of the oxygen diffusion into the paint layer and the oxygen quenching on the paint luminescence...|$|R
