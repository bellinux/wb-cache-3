25|$|Financial {{services}} such as banking and insurance use applications of <b>predictive</b> <b>analytics</b> for churn modeling, because customer retention {{is an essential part}} of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of <b>predictive</b> <b>analytics,</b> including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn.|$|E

Classification and regression problems that assume non-uniform costs and/or benefits pose serious challenges to <b>predictive</b> <b>analytic</b> tasks. In the context of meteorology, finance, medicine, ecology, among many other, specific domain information concerning the preference bias of the users {{must be taken into}} account to enhance the models predictive performance. To deal with this problem, a large number of techniques was proposed by the research community for both classification and regression tasks. The main goal of UBL package is to facilitate the utility-based <b>predictive</b> <b>analytic</b> task by providing a set of methods to deal with this type of problems in the R environment. It is a versatile tool that provides mechanisms to handle both regression and classification (binary and multiclass) tasks. Moreover, UBL package allows the user to specify his domain preferences, but it also provides some automatic methods that try to infer those preference bias from the domain, considering some common known settings...|$|R

25|$|The {{actual data}} mining task is the {{semi-automatic}} or automatic analysis of {{large quantities of}} data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then {{be seen as a}} kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and <b>predictive</b> <b>analytics.</b> For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.|$|E

2500|$|When {{companies}} are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make {{the distinction between}} gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition {{is the loss of}} existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Recurring Monthly Revenue (or RMR). [...] In the 2000s, there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated <b>predictive</b> <b>analytics</b> software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.|$|E
