5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an aqueous homogeneous reactor, but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to <b>pool</b> <b>resources,</b> and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Payment for Watershed Ecosystem Services as an institutional arrangement under {{the approach of}} enabling conditions for the durability of institutions. This approach searches for specifying {{the conditions under which}} self organized groups of users, govern sustainably the resource upon which they depend.

The critical enabling conditions for the sustainability of the watershed as a Common <b>Pool</b> <b>Resource</b> correspond to different circumstances than that of a conventional Common <b>Pool</b> <b>Resource.</b> The interdependence among the resources in an ecosystem, in the particular case of land uses and water quality and quantity in the watershed, drives to different interactions among the users. This situation means the interaction of user groups with different interest and characteristics. Relevance and correspondence of a number of enabling conditions for PWES are discussed based on empirical information from four case studies.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{rewarding}} on social dilemma outcomes are investigated {{by means of an}} economic experiment. The social dilemma that is considered, is the so called Common <b>Pool</b> <b>Resource</b> (CPR) game, in which individuals make investment decisions which have negative externalities. After each investment decision, subjects have two rounds in which they can reward each other. We find that adding two stages of rewarding promotes cooperation in the common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> only marginally. The addition of two stages of rewards triggers beliefs about the evolution of the game. These beliefs are then reinforced by the rewarding behavior. Subjects use the investment stage as a way to seek group members which whom they will exchange reward tokens in both stage 2 and stage 3. The influence of stage 1 on stage 2 is significant and prevalent. However, the influence of stage 1 on stage 3 is much smaller. Stage 3 rewards are mainly influenced by stage 2 rewards. The addition of the second stage of rewarding is {{the driving force behind the}} evolution of the use of the common <b>pool</b> <b>resource.</b> It is this stage that ensures that subjects can exploit their bilateral relationships. Therefore, the profits do not necessarily have to come from the common <b>pool</b> <b>resource...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} and {{illustrates the}} potential of intelligent agent based modeling and simulation {{as a tool for}} understanding individual action and group performance in common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> dilemmas. Three groups of models were developed, based on previously documented common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experiments, and simulated using the Swarm multi-agent simulation environment. Agents in these models were designed to represent the actions of the individual appropriators in the experiments and the common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> itself. The three groups of models are differentiated by the capabilities of the appropriator agents and address; preassigned fixed strategies with no communication, a simple induction based approach to selecting amongst alternative strategies with no communication, and the induction based approach with two simple communication routines. Simulations of these three groups of models rendered observations of some potential relationships between individual action and group performance in common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experimental situations. In particular, simulations of agents employing the induction based approach with no-communication generated group level behavior with similar performance characteristics to groups in actual experiments. A discussion relates the behavior of these simulations to other simulation based work in game theory and learning theory. Some potential future directions for this research, and possible applications in natural resources management, are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|To redress this, one {{traditional}} {{scheme for}} common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> management is a [...] "Leviathan" [...] strategy, {{in which a}} central authority (like government) must enforce rules, and coerce and punish appropriators as necessary to obey resource rules; however a large enforcer cannot catch all offenders or obtain complete information so the Leviathan strategy is not a perfect solution. The second traditional scheme for common <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> management is privatization, in which resources are tangibly divided and exclusively managed and consumed by individual entities. However, privatization is not a perfect solution because it erroneously assumes when the <b>resource</b> <b>pool</b> is divided, all resultant units have equal value.|$|R

500|$|Following a bid from AGMA {{highlighting}} {{the potential benefits}} in combatting the late-2000s financial crisis, it was announced in the 2009 United Kingdom Budget that Greater Manchester and the Leeds City Region would be awarded Statutory City Region Pilot status, allowing (if they desired) for their constituent district councils to <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> and become statutory Combined Authorities with powers comparable to the Greater London Authority. The stated aim of the pilot was to evaluate the contributions to economic growth and sustainable development by Combined Authorities. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enabled {{the creation of a}} Combined Authority for Greater Manchester with devolved powers on public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, carbon neutrality and planning permission, pending approval from the ten councils. Such strategic matters would be decided on via an enhanced majority rule voting system involving ten members appointed from among the councillors of the metropolitan boroughs (one representing each borough with each council nominating one substitute) without the input of central government. The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on 29 March 2010, and submitted final recommendations for a constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport. On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15-week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution. Following requests by the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, which was superseded by the GMCA, the new authority came into being on 1 April 2011. On the same day, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee was also formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population (roughly one councillor per 75,000 residents) to scrutinise the running of Greater Manchester's transport bodies and their finances, approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the Combined Authority. On 3 November 2014, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that there would be an eleventh member of the GMCA — a directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, with [...] "powers over transport, housing, planning and policing" [...] from 2017. This announcement was followed up on 25 February 2015 with news that Greater Manchester would be the first part of England to [...] "get full control of its health spending" [...] with a devolution deal from April 2016.|$|E
