50|$|Another {{important}} {{quality of}} polyfluorenes is their thermotropic liquid crystallinity {{which allows the}} polymers to align on rubbed polyimide layers. Thermotropic liquid crystallinity refers to the polymers' ability to exhibit a phase transition into the liquid crystal phase as the temperature is changed. This {{is very important to}} the development of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) because the synthesis of liquid crystal displays requires that the liquid-crystal molecules at the two glass surfaces of the cell be aligned parallel to the two polarizer foils.This can only be done by coating the inner-surfaces of the cell with a thin, transparent film of polyamide which is then rubbed with a velvet cloth. Microscopic grooves are then generated in the polyamide layer and the liquid crystal in contact with the polyamide, the polyfluorene, can align in the rubbing direction. In addition to LCDs, polyfluorene {{can also be used to}} synthesize light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Polyfluorene has led to LEDs that can emit polarized light with <b>polarization</b> <b>ratios</b> of more than 20 and with brightness of 100 cd m−2.

40|$|Following {{the paper}} by Fraser-Smith et al. (1990), many {{scientists}} have focused their {{research on the}} ULF geomagnetic field pulsations {{in the hope of}} finding possible anomalous signals caused by the seismic activity. Thereafter, many papers have reported ULF geomagnetic field <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases which have been claimed {{to be related to the}} occurrence of moderate and strong earthquakes. Even if there is no firm evidence of correlation between the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increase and seismic events, these publications maintain that these ‘‘anomalous’’ increases are without doubt precursors of pending earthquakes. Furthermore, several researchers suggest that these seismogenic signals may be considered a promising approach towards the possibility of developing short-term earthquake prediction capabilities based on electromagnetic precursory signatures. On the contrary, a part of the scientific community emphasizes the lack of validation of claimed seismogenic anomalies and doubt their association with the seismic activity. Since earthquake prediction is a very important topic of social importance, the authenticity of earthquake precursors needs to be carefully checked. The aim of this paper is to investigate the reliability of the ULF magnetic <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> changes as an earthquakes’ precursor. Several <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases of the geomagnetic field, which previous researchers have claimed to have a seismogenic origin, are put into question by a qualitative investigation. The analysis takes into account both the temporal evolution of the geomagnetic field <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> reported in previous papers, and the global geomagnetic activity behaviour. Running averages of the geomagnetic index Kp are plotted onto the original figures from previous publications. Moreover, further quantitative analyses are also reported. Here, nine cases are investigated which include 17 earthquakes. In seven cases it is shown that the suggested association between the geomagnetic field <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases and the earthquake preparation process seems to be rather doubtful. More precisely, the claimed seismogenic <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases are actually closely related to decreases in the geomagnetic activity level. Furthermore, the last two investigated cases seem to be doubtful as well, although a close correspondence between <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> and geomagnetic activity cannot be unambiguously demonstrated...|$|R

Understanding the 3 D structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for understanding the nature and origin of solar eruptions. However, owing to the optical thinness of the solar corona we can only observe the line of sight integrated emission. As a consequence the resulting projection effects hide the true 3 D structure of CMEs.

The soon-to-be-launched METIS coronagraph on board Solar Orbiter will use this technique to produce new polarimetric images. Aims. This work considers the application of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique to synthetic CME observations from METIS. In particular we determine the accuracy at which the position of the centre of mass, direction and speed of propagation, and the column density of the CME can be determined along the line of sight. Methods. We perform a 3 D MHD simulation of a flux rope ejection where a CME is produced. From the simulation we (i) synthesize the corresponding METIS white-light (total and polarized brightness) images and (ii) apply the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique to these synthesized images and compare the results with the known density distribution from the MHD simulation. In addition, we use recent results that consider how the position of a single blob of plasma is measured depending on its projected position in the plane of the sky. From this we can interpret the results of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique and give an estimation of the error associated with derived parameters. Results. We find that the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique reproduces with high accuracy the position of the centre of mass along the line of sight. However, some errors are inherently associated with this determination. The <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique also allows information to be derived on the real 3 D direction of propagation of the CME. The determination of this is of fundamental importance for future space weather forecasting. In addition, we find that the column density derived from white-light images is accurate and we propose an improved technique where the combined use of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> technique and white-light images minimizes the error in the estimation of column densities. Moreover, by applying the comparison to a set of snapshots of the simulation we can also assess the errors related to the trajectory and the expansion of the CME. Conclusions.

However, the observed fluorescence <b>polarization</b> <b>ratios</b> also depend on any mobility of the fluorophores on the time scale of the fluorescence lifetime.

By utilizing a preexisting, independent, water surface discrimination technique, the microwave returns were extracted along individual waveforms {{and the data}} from shoaling (steepening) waves, surf zone breaking waves, and remnant foam were separated and quantified. In addition, a wave tracking analysis technique allows the returns to be examined on a wave-by-wave basis as individual waves progress through the shoal-ing zone and break on a nearshore sand bar. Normalized radar cross sections (NRCS), <b>polarization</b> <b>ratios,</b> Doppler spectra, and scatterer velocities were collected using a dual-polarized, X-band radar operating at lower grazing angles than previously reported (1 – 3. 5). The {{results indicate that the}} maximum NRCS levels are from the active breaking portions of the wave and were consistently about 220 dB, regardless of radar polarization, azimuth angle, wave height, or wind speed. In addition, breaking waves induce broadening of the Doppler spectra and mean scatterer velocities that correlate well with the carrier wave celerity. Analysis of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratios</b> suggest that the active breaking portions of the wave are depolarized but that higher <b>polarization</b> <b>ratios</b> (> 0 dB) are found on the leading edges shoreward of the active breaking portions of the waves, which indicates a clear distinction between two scattering regimes.
