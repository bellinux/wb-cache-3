5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position.

40|$|This is {{the draft}} summary chapter for a {{collection}} of essays, European Public Spheres: Politics is Back (forthcoming, Cambridge University Press). It critically assesses {{what we do and}} do not know about the relation of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to politics and the social more generally, and points out several gaps and challenges to address. First, arguments about <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> are ultimately claims about how language and communication shape politics. Recognizing that institutions, power and practice are important as well, scholars in other fields have supplemented the linguistic approach with other types of analysis. In work on <b>public</b> <b>spheres,</b> however, a similar move seems absent – which results in incomplete arguments, for example, on the relation of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to European identity. Second, how well do arguments on European <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> hold up cross-nationally – or even in respect to the enlarged Europe that today’s reality? Third, beyond establishing that Europeanized <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> matter, future research needs to explore how much they matter. This will involve more ambitious research designs – establishing baselines and relative weightings, identifying scope conditions and thinking counterfactually...|$|R

5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in the <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E

His father, Hagnon had {{played a significant role}} in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes' appearance on the scene. He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E

40|$|Revolutionary {{theories}} are most useful when {{they attempt to}} define and interpret the causes and mechanisms of revolutions. However, when they attempt to forecast the outcomes {{and the impact of}} revolutions on their indigenous societies, they are largely unsuccessful. This article deals with the impact of the Young Turk revolution on three non-dominant ethnic groups in the Ottoman Empire: Armenians, Arabs, and Jews. It will argue that the revolution resulted {{in the creation of a}} multiplicity of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> among the ethnic groupS. 1 This multiplicity of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> became the main medium through which these ethnic groups internalized the Young Turk revolution. In the case of the Armenians and the Jews, these <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> resulted in the occurrence of micro-revolutions, whereas in the Arab case it led to the erosion of social and political stability. Nevertheless, these various subordinate <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> cannot be viewed in isolation from one another. They were interconnected and influenced each other both directly and indirectly. Moreover, within these interconnected <b>public</b> <b>spheres,</b> new actors emerged, threatening the social and political stability of the existing orders not only to (re) define their identities in the post-revolutionary period by inventing their own ancien regimes, victories, and new orders, but more importantly by competing against each other over control of existing positions of power, and in some cases, creating new ones. We will notice that in ethnic groups where power was centralized, the revolution was more successful than those where power was decentralized. Furthermore, this paper will argue that ecclesiastic politics, a subject that is totally marginalized within the Ottoman historiography of the Young Turk revolution, was a crucial factor in defining the intra-ethnic politics in the newly emerging subordinate <b>public</b> <b>spheres...</b>|$|R

During the election campaign, the party ‘performed democracy’ by playing with irrational, satirical discourses that challenged traditional discourses within political <b>public</b> <b>spheres.</b> Soon after his inauguration, Gnarr began a Facebook page called ‘The Mayor’s Diary’ {{on which he}} wrote openly about the challenges faced by a newcomer to politics. Approximately 10 % of the Icelandic population follows his profile. This article presents {{an analysis of the}} communication conducted on the Mayor’s Diary, particularly of how Facebook as a media environment conditions the Mayor’s performative manoeuvres and, correspondingly, how the subversive discourses galvanised in the election campaign can begin ricocheting back when discussions move from cultural <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to political <b>public</b> <b>spheres...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{emergence}} of a bourgeois <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} “publicity” stress that {{multiple}} ideas and values must {{be integrated into}} <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> from the view of normative political theory. In discussing publicity, {{this article focuses on}} repertoires in social movements, that is, modes of expressing their ideas and values. Although social movements have been regarded as political actors who works for democracy, few social movement scholars have discussed the roles of their repertoires in opening <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to voices of marginalised people. This article thus argues about the relationship between diversified repertoires and publicity. I, first of all, explore how “institutionalisation” of social movements, a conventional repertoire, leads to incorporate multiple ideas and values into <b>public</b> <b>spheres.</b> While institutionalisation helps social movement organisations to increase their influence on decision makings of powerful political actors, such as corporations and governments, it also enhances accountability within the organisations and democratises the organisational structure of the movements. Next, I move to arguing about the roles of “protests”, a confrontational repertoire, in diversifying publicity. This repertoire contributes to making values and ideas which are difficult to be institutionalised visible in <b>public</b> <b>spheres.</b> In discussing two different repertoires, I emphasise that these repertoires do not always lead to diversifying <b>public</b> <b>spheres.</b> While voices of marginalised people can be ignored and excluded in institutionalisation of social movements, protests have a risk in being viewed as violent actions and isolating activists from the public. This article concludes that different repertoires operate effectively in diversifying publicity when they are mutually complemented. 論文Paper...|$|R

Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.|$|E
