500|$|In December 1973, a joint American and British team {{completed}} a <b>project</b> <b>document</b> defining an Advanced Harrier {{powered by the}} Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, {{as well as the}} USMC's A-4. The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the [...] RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement. With development costs estimated to be around £180–200million (1974 British pounds), the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.|$|E

5000|$|European Digital Rights is a {{group that}} was created to defend {{the civil rights of}} the people in the {{information}} society. This group has actively spoken out against the Clean IT project by not only saying that the project itself is a violation of privacy but they highlight a very key aspect in the final published version of the Clean IT <b>project</b> <b>document</b> that there is a huge amount of censorship power that involves the interest of the private filtering companies. The whole dialogue that was created by the Clean IT project was not a government centered dialogue but it was a government with a few multi corporate companies to counter online terrorism. However, during the process, EDRi suggests that the private companies’ personal interests had been readily involved in the <b>project</b> <b>document</b> itself. The fact the document does not specify the term for what contents to block implies that the censored content depends on the reliability of the companies that provide the internet content. Also EDRi points out that the term [...] "block" [...] in the document is also used very vaguely in the sense that some customers will be limited and others will not be which suggests an unequal exposure to certain content. These two principles imply, EDRi suggests that the private companies have a considerable influence on the project itself and the disclosure of information.|$|E
