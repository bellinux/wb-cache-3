40|$|We have {{considered}} the problem of determining {{the values of the}} joint variables of a mobile manipulator with many redundant degrees of freedom that will minimize an objective function when the position and orientation {{of the end of the}} manipulator are given. The objective function is the weighted sum of three components: distance, torque, and reach. Each of the three components is a max or min. We have converted the min-max optimization problem into a nonlinear programming problem and used the Kuhn-Tucker conditions to derive necessary conditions for the optimum solutions. The necessary conditions require that one or more of each of the three sets (distance, torque, and reach) of nonnegative Lagrange multipliers must be positive. If one of the Lagrange multipliers is <b>positive,</b> the corresponding <b>slack</b> variable must be zero. When two or more of the Lagrange multipliers from a single set are <b>positive,</b> the <b>slack</b> variables place constraints on the joint variables. Specification of the Cartesian position and orientation of the end of the arm also places constraints on the joint variables. If the mobile manipulator has N degrees of freedom and the total number of constraints is M, the constraints define a manifold of dimensions N - M. When N = M, the dimension of the manifold is zero (it consists of isolated points). When N > M, a search of the manifold may yield a submanifold that maximizes the Lagrangian function.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique {{to minimize the}} total power consumption of a synchronous linear pipeline circuit by exploiting extra slacks available in some stages of the pipeline.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the single machine due date assignment and scheduling problems with n jobs {{in which the}} due dates are to {{be obtained from the}} processing times by adding a <b>positive</b> <b>slack</b> q. A schedule is feasible if there are no tardy jobs and the job sequence respects given precedence constraints. The value of q is chosen so as to minimize a function ϕ(F,q) which is non-decreasing in each of its arguments, where F is a certain non-decreasing earliness penalty function. Once q is chosen or fixed, the corresponding scheduling problem is to find a feasible schedule with the minimum value of function F. In the case of arbitrary precedence constraints the problems under consideration are shown to be NP-hard in the strong sense even for F being total earliness. If the precedence constraints are defined by a series-parallel graph, both scheduling and due date assignment problems are proved solvable in time, provided that F is either the sum of linear functions or the sum of exponential functions. The running time of the algorithms can be reduced to if the jobs are independent. Scope and purpose We consider the single machine due date assignment and scheduling problems and design fast algorithms for their solution under a wide range of assumptions. The problems under consideration arise in production planning when the management is faced with a problem of setting the realistic due dates for a number of orders. The due dates of the orders are determined by increasing the time needed for their fulfillment by a common <b>positive</b> <b>slack.</b> If the slack is set to be large enough, the due dates can be easily maintained, thereby producing a good image of the firm. This, however, may result in the substantial holding cost of the finished products before they are brought to the customer.

Whether prior research on organizational slack can readily inform our understanding of state-owned enterprises ’ (SOEs) behavior is questionable since SOEs prioritize goals such as social welfare and full employment differently than do the privately owned enterprises (POEs).

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{technique}} to use dual supply voltages in digital designs to reduce energy consumption. New algorithms are proposed for finding and assigning a lower voltage in a dual voltage design. Given a circuit and a supply voltage and an upper bound on the critical path delay, the first algorithm finds an optimal lower supply voltage and a second algorithm assigns that lower voltage to selected gates. A linear time algorithm described in the literature is used for computing slacks for all gates of the circuit for a given supply voltage. For the computed gate slacks and the lower supply voltage, all gates are divided into three groups such that no gate in the first group can be assigned the lower supply, all gates in the second group can be simultaneously set to lower supply while maintaining <b>positive</b> <b>slack</b> for every gate, and gates in the third group are assigned low voltage, iteratively, in selected subsets at a time. The gate slacks are recalculated after each such voltage assignment. Thus, the overall complexity of this reduced power dual voltage assignment procedure is O(n 2). SPICE simulations of ISCAS’ 85 benchmark circuits using the 90 -nm bulk CMOS technology results show up to 60 % energy savings.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new slack-time based algorithm for dual Vdd design to achieve maximum energy saving. Although a global optimum is sought computation time is kept low. The slack of a gate {{is defined as}} the difference between the critical path delay for the circuit and the delay of the longest path through that gate. A linear-time algorithm is used for computing slacks for all gates of the circuit. Positive non-zero slack gates are classified into two groups, one in which all gates can be unconditionally assigned low voltage and the other where only a selected subset can be assigned low voltage without violating the positive non-zero slack requirement. Multiple voltage boundaries are given special consideration. The overall complexity of this power optimization algorithm is linear in number of gates as compared to a previously published exponential-time exact algorithm using mixed integer linear program (MILP). We apply the new algorithm to optimize ISCAS’ 85 benchmark circuits and compare the results with those from MILP. We avoid the use of level converters at multiple voltage boundaries. Energy savings from the new slack-time based algorithm is very closed to those from MILP. For c 880, the energy saving is 22 % for subthreshold voltage operation and 50 % for nominal operation in PTM CMOS 90 nm. For c 2670 nominal voltage design, time of dual voltage optimization is reduced 43 X compared to the MILP method. This new algorithm is beneficial for large circuits with many large <b>positive</b> <b>slack</b> paths that would require enormous time for optimization by the MILP approach. I...|$|E
