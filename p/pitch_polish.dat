40|$|The {{effect of}} {{polishing}} an optical workpiece with a polyurethane pad was studied in this paper, including material removal rate, surface roughness and subsurface damage. Usually, optical <b>polishing</b> <b>pitch</b> {{is applied to}} polish optical workpieces, but the material removal rate (MRR) of pitch is quite low, and polyurethane foam is thus substituted for <b>polishing</b> <b>pitch.</b> With the polyurethane pad a much higher MRR was obtained. Surface roughness and subsurface damage of workpieces were also examined. We were gratified to find that {{there was almost no}} subsurface damage in the workpieces manufactured with pad polishing and surface roughness was comparable to the result of <b>pitch</b> <b>polishing.</b> Finally, a hypothesis was proposed in an attempt to explain the result that workpieces were defect-free.

40|$|Lightweight space mirrors {{have been}} widely used in earth {{observation}} and astronomy applications. Many organizations and companies, such as NASA in America, ESA in Europe, SSTL in UK as well as CASC in China, {{have spent a lot of}} money and effort on researching new materials for larger size space mirrors to meet both the payload weight constraints of launch and the increased advanced manufacturing process demanded for higher observations quality. This project is aimed at robot neutral polishing of lapped, ground and polished optical substrates using an industrial FANUC robot system. The project focused on three main fields which were: robot polishing with polyurethane tool and cerium oxide, <b>pitch</b> <b>polishing</b> with <b>pitch</b> tool and cerium oxide, as well as polishing of a 400 mm ULE component. The polishing process targets were to achieve: 1) a surface roughness (Ra) of 10 nm and a surface profile (Pt) of 6 µm and 2 µm on lapped and ground substrates respectively with polyurethane based tools and 2) a surface roughness (Ra) of 2 nm with a surface profile (Pt) unchanged on robot neutral <b>polished</b> substrates using <b>pitch</b> based tools. This thesis comprises four main sections: a literature review, an experimental implementation, metrology and analysis, and the final conclusions. The experiment results measured with the metrology equipment selected were analysed. Conclusions of the relationship between the polishing performance of a specific sample and the selected polishing tool, polishing slurry, tool pressure, polishing time and other parameters were drawn. Results obtained from robot neutral polishing were surface roughness (Ra) of 8 - 10 nm and surface profile (Pt) of 6 µm for 100 mm square lapped and ground parts. The process scalability was demonstrated from robot neutral polishing in 45 hours, a 400 mm square ground component from a surface roughness (Ra) of 200 nm to 10 nm. There is additional work to be implemented in the future, such as the development of robot <b>pitch</b> <b>polishing</b> of robot neutral polished parts to achieve 2 nm Ra...|$|R

40|$|Single-crystal calcium {{fluoride}} (CaF_ 2) {{is an excellent}} optical material in the infrared range and the ultraviolet range. It is an indispensable substrate material for the 193 and 157 nm wavelength laser optics for future large-scale semiconductor photolithography systems. Due to its delicate nature, {{for the most part}} the CaF_ 2 elements have been fabricated using conventional <b>pitch</b> <b>polishing</b> combined with interferometry and local surface correction to form the desired flat, sphere or aspherical surface. In the present work, the feasibility of generating high quality optical surfaces on CaF_ 2 by single-point diamond turning is examined. The development of this technology may provide the possibility of fabricating aspherical and diffractive optical components in an efficient way. The machining experiments described in this article were done on a high-stiffness, ultraprecision, numerically controlled diamond lathe with a sharply pointed single-crystal diamond tool. The scale of machining was varied from the micrometer level to the nanometer level. It was found that at the micrometer level, machining was significantly affected by the crystal orientation of the workpiece. The crystallographic anisotropy causes nonuniformity of the finished surface texture, microfracture topography and brittle-ductile transition boundary conditions. The results also indicate that by controlling the undeformed chip thickness below a critical value, namely, the minimum critical chip thickness (85 nm), a uniformly ductile-machined surface could be produced. Under the present experimental conditions, a surface with a maximum height (Ry) of 18. 5 nm and arithmetical mean roughness (Ra) of 3. 3 nm was obtained...|$|R
5000|$|The {{other form}} of lapping {{involves}} a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap, which is [...] "charged" [...] with the abrasive. The lap is then used to cut a harder material — the workpiece. The abrasive embeds within the softer material, which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material. Taken to a finer limit, this will produce a polished surface such as with a polishing cloth on an automobile, or a polishing cloth or <b>polishing</b> <b>pitch</b> upon glass or steel.|$|R

40|$|Large-aperture Nd-doped {{metaphosphate}} {{glasses are}} used in high-power/ high-energy laser facilities. High transmission wave front accuracy of Nd-doped metaphosphate glasses is required to decrease beam distortion, which affects the focus ability and damages optical components. Elliptical shape astigmatism of the transmission wave front easily occurs when Nd-doped metaphosphate glasses are detected and utilized at Brewster incident angle compared with zero angle. The astigmatism is difficult to decrease for precision annular polishing because the surface profile adjustment of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pitch</b> plane has low accuracy.

25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a <b>polishing</b> <b>pitch</b> lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|R
40|$|The various {{properties}} of <b>polishing</b> <b>pitches</b> have different advantages and are selected {{according to the}} type of work intended. It is important to check pitch properties before a pitch lap is poured; to ensure that the final polishing lap properties will be as desired. A simple penetrometer test is utilized as a quality control tool for measuring the hardness (viscosity) of various types of pitch as received from the manufacturer. Only a small sample, 20 grams, is needed for this test. Another simple method for determining pitch quality is the measurement of the softening point. A description of this method and typical results will be described. Lastly, the "tackiness " of pitch and its importance will be discussed. Lessons learned with pitch preparation, testing, and pouring will complete this broad overview of pitch and some of its properties and applications...|$|R

5000|$|The Second World War {{started in}} September 1939, as Poland {{suffered}} {{an attack by}} Nazi Germany and later by the USSR. Many Polish troops and servicemen escaped the occupied country. They reorganized in France and {{took part in the}} Battle of France. Later Poles organized troops in the United Kingdom and were integrated into the forces of Britain with Polish pilots serving with distinction in the Battle of Britain. Poland was the only German-occupied country that never had any official collaboration with the Nazis. The Polish Resistance Movement was the largest anti-Nazi resistance in the whole Nazi-occupied Europe, and the only non-Communist resistance among the Slavic countries. It is remembered for its daring and brave methods of resisting occupation, often facing German forces in <b>pitched</b> battle. <b>Polish</b> armies also reformed in Soviet territory. The Polish-Jewish community was mostly exterminated in the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland, while Poles themselves were considered to be a threat to the [...] "German race", and were classificated as [...] "subhumans". Millions of Poles were sent to concentration camps or were killed in other fashions in occupied Poland. German-occupied Poland was the only territory where any kind of help for Jews was punishable by death for the helper and his whole family. Even though, many Polish civilians risked their lives, and the lives of their families, to save the Jews from the Nazis. Moreover, Poles created [...] "Żegota" [...] - the only organization in occupied Europe, entirely focused on helping the Jews.|$|R
40|$|Intonation is an {{important}} cue in evaluating speech of other speakers. Studies have shown how pragmatically meaningful it is (Grabe et al. 2003). Apart from intonational contours that may be interpreted differently depending on the context, pitch range has been named a speech parameter that is especially conducive to judging whether a speaker sounds friendly or unfriendly. Chen, Rietveld and Gussenhoven (2001) compared pitch range in Dutch and English, concluding that the latter is perceived as more friendly than the former due to its larger pitch range. This conclusion has led us to investigate the status of Polish in this analysis. In the present study, we recorded two adult male native speakers of Dutch, English and Polish and compared their pitch span and register (Ohala 1983). English {{was found to have}} a wider pitch range than Dutch, similarly to the previous study, while Polish was found to have a wider pitch range than Dutch but narrower than English. In {{the second part of the}} experiment, our subjects will evaluate how friendly the speech recordings will sound to them. Apart from raw speech samples, we have prepared modified recordings using Praat (Boersma and Weenink 2013), where both pitch span and register were set at the same levels across all speakers. We have prepared an online survey, comprising of a set of randomly ordered recordings of Dutch, English and Polish declarative, lexically identical sentences, both raw and acoustically modified. The participants (at least 20 native speakers of Dutch, English and Polish) will assess the speakers in terms of friendliness using a seven­point Likert scale. The survey will be preceded by a questionnaire concerning participants’ L 1 and L 2, age, gender, etc. Our hypotheses are that 1) the scores for the modified recordings will differ from the unmodified ones, signifying that pitch range is the main criterion for judging whether a speaker sounds friendly or unfriendly, 2) Dutch will be perceived as the least friendly due to its narrow <b>pitch</b> range, 3) <b>Polish</b> will be perceived as less friendly than English. Polish has rarely been featured in language attitude studies so far, hence, it is especially interesting to see how it scores in relation to English and Dutch. If the intermediate status of <b>Polish</b> <b>pitch</b> patterns is confirmed, yet another evidence will be obtained in the support of the view that pitch is the primary cue for determining speech friendliness...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} solid scientific understanding of the creation and characteristics of surface fractures formed during the grinding and polishing of brittle materials, specifically glass. In this study, we have experimentally characterized the morphology, number density, and depth distribution of various surface cracks as a function of various grinding and polishing processes (blanchard, fixed abrasive grinding, loose abrasive, <b>pitch</b> <b>polishing</b> and pad polishing). Also, the effects of load, abrasive particle (size, distribution, foreign particles, geometry, velocity), and lap material (pitch, pad) were examined. The resulting data were evaluated in terms of indentation fracture mechanics and tribological interactions (science of interacting surfaces) leading to several models to explain crack distribution behavior of ground surfaces and to explain the characteristics of scratches formed during polishing. This project has greatly advanced the scientific knowledge of microscopic mechanical damage occurring during grinding and polishing and has been of general interest. This knowledge-base has also enabled the design and optimization of surface finishing processes to create optical surfaces with far superior laser damage resistance. There are five major areas of scientific progress {{as a result of this}} LDRD. They are listed in Figure 1 and described briefly in this summary below. The details of this work are summarized through a number of published manuscripts which are included this LDRD Final Report. In the first area of grinding, we developed a technique to quantitatively and statistically measure the depth distribution of surface fractures (i. e., subsurface damage) in fused silica as function of various grinding processes using mixtures of various abrasive particles size distributions. The observed crack distributions were explained using a model that extended known, single brittle indentation models to an ensemble of loaded, sliding particles. The model illustrates the importance of the particle size distribution of the abrasive and its influence on the resulting crack distribution. The results of these studies are summarized in references 1 - 7. In the second area of polishing, we conducted a series of experiments showing the influence of rogue particles (i. e., particles in the polishing slurry that are larger than base particles) on the creation of scratches on polished surfaces. Scratches can be thought of a as a specific type of sub-surface damage. The characteristics (width, length, type of fractures, concentration) were explained in terms of the rogue particle size, the rogue particle material, and the viscoelastic properties of the lap. The results of these studies are summarized in references 6 - 7. In the third area of etching, we conducted experiments aimed at understanding the effect of HF:NH{sub 4 }F acid etching on surface fractures on fused silica. Etching can be used as a method: (a) to expose sub-surface mechanical damage, (b) to study the morphology of specific mechanical damage occurring by indentation, and (c) to convert a ground surface containing a high concentration of sub-surface mechanical damage into surface roughness. Supporting models have been developed to describe in detail the effect of etching on the morphology and evolution of surface cracks. The results of these studies are summarized in references 8 - 9. In the fourth area of scratch forensics or scratch fractography, a set of new scratch forensic rule-of-thumbs were developed in order to aid the optical fabricator and process engineer to interpret the cause of scratches and digs on surfaces. The details of how these rules were developed are described in each of the references included in this summary (1 - 9). Figure 2 provides as a summary of some of the more commonly used rules-of-thumbs that have been developed in this study. In the fifth and final area of laser damage, we demonstrated that the removal of such surface fractures from the surface during optical fabrication can dramatically improve the laser damage...|$|R
25|$|Polish {{historian}} Stefan Krakowski {{credits the}} relative {{failure of the}} Mongol invasion to two main causes. One, while at 30,000 men it was larger than the previous incursions into Poland, the rivalry between Talabuga and Nogai meant that the two columns didn't cooperate well, with the former withdrawing {{by the time the}} latter entered Poland. Two, the Poles' upgraded fortifications made their settlements much harder to take, which enabled Leszek and his nobles to put into action a simple three-stage defensive plan. The first stage stage was passive defense by garrisons (e.g. Sandomierz, Łysa Góra, Kraków, Tursko), the second was the fight against small Mongol detachments by local sallying forces, and the third stage was a counterblow of a large Hungarian-Polish army against the dispersed and reduced Mongols. This contrasted quite sharply with the first invasion. There the Mongols also dispersed their army into smaller units, but were able to easily take the poorly fortified settlements they attacked and smash the Polish forces sent to meet them in open field <b>pitched</b> battles, destroying <b>Polish</b> forces near-simultaneously at Sandomierz, Tursko, and Tarczek, in mid February and at Chmielnik, Krakow,, and Raciborz in late March, without much skirmishing or any protracted sieges.|$|R

He had concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration).

To create the primary mirror Newton used a custom composition of metal consisting of six parts copper to two parts tin, an early composition of speculum metal. He devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a <b>pitch</b> lap to <b>polish</b> the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction: he had satisfied himself that the chromatic, and not the spherical aberration, formed the chief faults of refracting telescopes. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a [...] "Newtonian telescope", a secondary [...] "diagonal" [...] mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope.

Newton's friend Isaac Barrow showed a second telescope to a small group from the Royal Society of London at the end of 1671. They were so impressed with it that they demonstrated it to Charles II in January 1672. Newton was admitted as a fellow of the society in the same year.|$|R
