CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery.

500|$|In the {{differential}} diagnosis (finding the correct diagnosis between diseases that have overlapping features) of some obstructive lung diseases, DPB is often considered.

Hypercapnia was defined as P aCO 2 ≥ 6 · 0 kPa and hypoxia asP aO 2 < 9 · 3 kPa. Patients with abnormal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were more hypoxic and hypercapnic, more obese, and had a higher apnoea–hypopnoea index (P< 0 · 05). Seventeen patients of group I and four of group II were hypercapnic (13 · 6 % and 4 · 3 %, respectively). Thirty-one patients in group I (24 · 8 %) had a P aO 2 < 9 · 3 kPa and six (6 · 5 %) in group II. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that in group II, only two factors were correlated with P aCO 2 : mean apnoea duration and FRC (respectively: c= 0 · 228, P< 0 · 001;c= 0 · 006,P = 0 · 0108); and only two with P aO 2 : mean apnoea duration: (c=− 0 · 218, P= 0 · 029) and BMI (c=− 3 · 72,P < 0 · 0001).

2500|$|There {{are three}} key {{elements}} to {{the diagnosis of}} silicosis. First, the patient history should reveal exposure to sufficient silica dust to cause this illness.

Physical examination is usually unremarkable unless there is complicated disease. Also, the examination findings are not specific for silicosis. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> may reveal airflow limitation, restrictive defects, reduced diffusion capacity, mixed defects, or may be normal (especially without complicated disease).

2500|$|Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is diagnosed}} {{in one of}} three circumstances: when a complete blood count reveals increased eosinophils and a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) identifies abnormalities in the lung, when a biopsy identifies increased eosinophils in lung tissue, or when increased eosinophils are found in fluid obtained by a bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage [...] fluid). Association with medication or cancer is usually apparent after review of a person's medical history. Specific parasitic infections are diagnosed after examining a person's exposure to common parasites and performing laboratory tests to look for likely causes. If no underlying cause is found, a diagnosis of AEP or CEP is made based upon the following criteria. AEP is most likely with respiratory failure after an acute febrile illness of [...] usually less than one week, changes in multiple areas and fluid in the area surrounding the lungs on a chest x-ray, and greater than 25% eosinophils on a BAL. Other typical laboratory abnormalities include an elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and immunoglobulin G level. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> usually reveals a restrictive process with reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. CEP is most likely when the symptoms have been present for more than a month. Laboratory tests typical of CEP include increased blood eosinophils, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, iron deficiency anemia, and increased platelets. A chest x-ray can show abnormalities anywhere, but the most specific finding is increased shadow in the periphery of the lung, away from the heart.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In {{this study}} we aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between expiratory HRCT findings, tracheal index (TI) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Materials and methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with COPD in our hospital, department of pulmonary medicine, and 65 subjects complaining of cough with normal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> as a control group were enrolled in the study. All subjects were evaluated with HRCT. HRCT and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in same day and FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC values were recorded. Pearson Chi-Square, Independent Samples T test, and Mann Whitney U test were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Subjects’ mean age was 55. 44 ± 10. 22 years. Bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, emphysema, centrilobular bronchiolar thickening and air trapping were significantly higher in COPD group than control group. In patient group, TI values were lower than control group (p < 0. 001). Also there was moderate negative relationship between TI and age (p = 0. 00, r = - 0. 48).

40|$|SummaryThis {{study was}} to examine the {{clinical}} differences between Stage 0 and normal subjects, using low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> Enrolled subjects performed as a health check for lung cancer screening including low-dose CT and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjects were divided into Stage 0, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests,</b> and normal subjects. The severity of emphysema (visual score) was calculated on three low-dose CT slices. Low-dose CT and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in 1359 men and 888 women. The numbers and percentages of men and women smokers were 1076 (79. 2 %), and 107 (12. 0 %), respectively. A total of 722 individuals had one or more respiratory symptoms, such as cough (69. 8 %), sputum (75. 8 %), or shortness of breathing (0. 83 %). Of the 722 subjects, 71 (9. 8 %) individuals satisfied the criteria of chronic respiratory symptoms. Among the normal subjects, smoking caused differences in airflow limitation as a result of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> The proportion of smokers and the visual score were significantly higher in Stage 0 than those in the normal subjects.
