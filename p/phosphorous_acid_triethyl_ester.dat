40|$|AbstractBoron-doped TiO 2 was {{prepared}} by the sol-gel method and by grinding TiO 2 powder with a boron compounds (boric acid and boric <b>acid</b> <b>triethyl</b> <b>ester</b> followed by calcinations at temperature range 200 to 600 °C. Three types of pristine TiO 2 : ST- 01 (Ishihara Sangyo Ltd., Japan; 300 m 2 /g), P 25 (Degussa, Germany, 50 m 2 /g), A 11 (Police S. A., Poland 12 m 2 /g) were used in grinding procedure. The photocatalytic activity of obtained powders in visible light was estimated by measuring the decomposition rate of phenol (0. 21 mmol/dm 3) in an aqueous solution. The photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy (XPS), UV-VIS absorption and BET surface area measurements. The best photoactivity under visible light was observed for B-TiO 2 modified with 2 wt% of boron prepared by grinding ST- 01 with dopant followed by calcinations at 400 °C. This photocatalyst contains 16. 9 at. % of carbon and 6. 6 at. % of boron in surface layer and its surface area is 192 m 2 /g...|$|R
40|$|MOST International S&T Cooperation Program of China [2010 DFA 64360]; Ministry of Science & Technology, Israel; Ministry of Science & Technology, PR China [7]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51272126]Four {{kinds of}} small {{molecules}} with different proton numbers including phenylphosphonic acid (PPA), diphenylphosphinic acid (DPPA), phosphoric <b>acid</b> <b>triethyl</b> <b>ester</b> (PATEE), and phosphorical acid tributyl ester (PATBE) were employed as co-adsorbents of {{dye sensitized solar cell}} (DSC). They were innovatively pre-adsorbed onto the nanocrystalline TiO 2 surface before dye molecule sensitization, which were detected from X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). Combined with UV-vis absorption analysis, {{it was found}} the co-adsorbents got to bind with TiO 2 more and more easily by increasing proton numbers, which in turn made dye loading amount get smaller and smaller. The as-prepared photoanodes were fabricated into solar cells, yielding impressively enhanced short-circuit current and cell efficiency except PPA which decreased the dye loading amount dramatically. The enhancement of charge recombination resistance and electron lifetime analyzed from EIS results revealed that the more prominent photovoltaic performance improvement with fewer protons was resulted by the more efficient inhibition of recombination between electrons in the conduction band of TiO 2 and the oxidized species in the electrolyte. Besides, regarding from the charge transport resistance, fewer protons are favorable for the negative shift of the conduction band level of TiO 2 and thus larger open-circuit yielding.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{preliminary}} experiment indicated that uptake of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> into Pinus radiata needles was low and proceeded very slowly. A similar uptake of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> was recorded at 24  h after treatment for the 3  kg ha- 1 and 12  kg ha- 1 <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> application rates, 6.6 % and 3.9 % respectively (Treatments 1 & 2; Table  1). Based on this preliminary experiment, {{it was decided to}} proceed with the highest rate of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> tested in the experiment (treatments 3 – 8), to maximise the acid dose absorbed by the foliage.|$|R
30|$|It {{is clear}} that the use of an organosilicone blend {{adjuvant}} in <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> treatments will improve coverage of sprays on Pinus radiata, in addition to its effects on the penetration of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> into the plants.

Preliminary indications from the detached needle bioassays indicate that the rates of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> used in this investigation (3  kg ha- 1 and 12  kg ha- 1) have the potential to reduce infection of Pinus radiata by Phytophthora species including P. kernoviae and P. pluvialis.

Anti-microbial products containing salts of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> are marketed in Australia as 'Yates Anti-Rot'; and in the United States of America, for example, aluminum salts of the monoethyl ester of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> (known generically as 'Fosetyl-Al') are sold under the trade name 'Aliette'. <b>Phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> and its salts, unlike phosphoric acid, are somewhat toxic and should be handled carefully.|$|R

The highest uptake of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> occurred with an organosilicone blend adjuvant (Du-Wett®) at a concentration of 0.2 %, and uptake progressed over a period of more than 24  hours after treatment. The addition of either of these adjuvants improved surface coverage of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> sprays and they are also likely to have some beneficial effects on spray retention.|$|R

30|$|Uptake of the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> {{formulation}} into Pinus radiata needles applied without adjuvants was low (3.9 - 6.6 %) at both concentrations tested. An alcohol ethoxylate adjuvant (applied at 0.2 %) and two organosilicone adjuvants (applied at 0.2 %) {{were found}} to significantly increase uptake of the fungicide over that applied alone or in combination with pinolene (applied at 0.35 %). Highest uptake of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> into Pinus radiata foliage (51.6 %) occurred {{over a period of}} 72  hours when the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> was applied at the equivalent of 12  kg ha- 1 with an organosilicone blend adjuvant at 0.2 %. A significant reduction in lesion length on infected needles was found relative to the control when the two <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> treatments were applied with 0.2 % organosilicone blend adjuvant.

30|$|The {{quantity}} of radiolabelled <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> applied to each needle in each treatment {{was determined by}} dispensing droplets, as applied to plants, directly into scintillation vials (3 replicates).

The entire fascicle, including the treated leaf surface, was washed {{with a mixture of}} water and ethanol (1 : 1  v/v; 2 × 4  mL) to recover any unabsorbed <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid.</b> Prior audits determined that such wash-offs could recover > 95 % of applied <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> solutions from foliage surfaces at dry-down. Foliage in Treatment # 3 (Table  1) was given an additional wash with 50 % aqueous acetone to ensure all <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> remaining on the surface was recovered. This extra wash was carried out because of the low solubility of the pinolene adjuvant in aqueous solution.|$|R

A repeat of Treatment 8 from Experiment 1 (8 R, Table  2) confirmed that the organosilicone blend increased <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> uptake. This treatment and all the others using the organosilicone blend superspreader (Treatments 9 – 12) increased uptake by more than nine-fold relative to the control (Table  2).

30|$|<b>Phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> fungicides, applied either pre-infection or for {{protectant}} activity, are {{the only}} known ambi-mobile fungicides capable of moving upward and downward in plants (Cohen and Coffey [1986]). <b>Phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> exhibits a complex mode of action, acting both directly on the pathogen and also indirectly by stimulating host defence responses to ultimately inhibit pathogen growth (Tomlin [2006]). The fungicide can persist in host plants for several months post application, however persistence is host dependent (Tynan et al. [2001]). When treated, most plants exhibit phytotoxic effects above a (species dependent) threshold concentration, with field treated plants more sensitive to phytotoxic effects than those treated in a glasshouse (Hardy et al. [2001]). Kanaskie et al. ([2011]) showed the potential for <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> to control outbreaks of sudden oak death, caused by Phytophthora ramorum S. Werres, A.W.A.M. de Cock & W.A. Man, in Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos, Cannon & S.H. Oh (south-western Oregon tanoak). Besides the work described by Kanaskie et al. ([2011]), there are few reports describing the use of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> to control Phytophthora spp. associated foliar diseases in mature trees. This is likely because there are few tree-infecting aerial Phytophthora spp. currently known and those which are known (such as P. ramorum, P. kernoviae, P. pinifolia and P. pluvialis) have been relatively recently observed. Graham ([2011]) suggested options for using <b>phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> to control Phytophthora species in forest trees based on work done on citrus orchards. <b>Phosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> has been successfully used to control Phytophthora root rot in Pinus radiata nurseries (Reglinski et al. [2009]). However, {{the results of this}} study cannot readily be extrapolated to airborne Phytophthora pathogens infecting mature trees.|$|R
