5|$|Kenwood {{was built}} in 1913, and was {{originally}} called The Brown House. On Wood Lane, off Cavendish Road, and built in a mock-Tudor style, the footprint and gardens cover , of which the house must occupy {{no more than one}} fifth and the <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> not be subdivided into more than one home under the rules of the building scheme. It was designed in 1913 by architect Theophilus Arthur Allen, who had been commissioned by local man Norman H. Johnson. Allen employed a local firm called Love & Sons in the construction of Kenwood. The hill was divided into lots around the Weybridge Golf Club, which was designed by Harry Colt in 1912. Many of the original houses on the estate were built by master builder Walter George Tarrant whose firm constructed the original external garage ca.1920 (demolished ca.1995).|$|E

However, this may have been based on his misreading of the words Deo notus in the second Passio Ursulae, written about 1105. The <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> have been influenced by a story told by the 6th-century writer Procopius about a British queen sailing with 100,000 soldiers to the mouth of the Rhine in order to compel her unwilling groom Radigis, king of the Varni, to marry her.|$|E

It is perhaps {{no coincidence that the}} Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> be seen as a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E

500|$|A {{plot of land}} {{bounded by}} Coventry, Sherwood, Glasshouse and Rupert streets and the line of Smith's Court was granted by Elizabeth I to William Dodington, a gentlemen of London, in 1559–60. A year or so later it was owned by a brewer, Thomas Wilson of St Botolph-without-Aldgate. The grant {{did not include a}} small parcel of land, [...] acres in area, on the east of what is now Great Windmill Street. That <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> have never belonged to the Crown, and was owned by Anthony Cotton in the reign of Henry VIII. John Cotton granted it to John Golightly in 1547, and his {{descendants}} sold it to a tailor, Robert Baker, in [...] 1611–12. Six or seven years later, Baker bought 22 acres of Wilson's land, thanks largely to money from his second marriage.|$|E
500|$|A {{wind rose}} is a graphic tool used by meteorologists {{to give a}} succinct view of how wind speed and {{direction}} are typically distributed at a particular location. [...] Presented in a polar coordinate grid, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions.

500|$|The story {{idea came}} from writer Howard Brenton, {{who wanted to}} delve {{into the world of}} suicide bombings, a {{significant}} issue in national security. It became the first episode in Spooks that explicitly portrays Islamic extremism, which Oyelowo described as a [...] "" [...] because of this sensitive issue. The actor was also worried that the <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> [...] "put ideas into people's heads" [...] after the audience would watch the episode. Brenton heavily researched the episode to provide a balanced view. He included characters, such as innocent Muslims who opposed the Islamic extremists, as well as a [...] "Muslim hero" [...] who would thwart the terrorists. The writer still wrote [...] "Nest of Angels" [...] as a classic spy story, where an operative goes undercover to subvert a villainous operation. Director Bharat Nalluri felt that making the hero a Muslim exemplified the balanced view. Series creator David Wolstencroft meanwhile, emphasised that the episode not only showed Islamic extremism, but a more peaceful side of the religion as well, and that the producers should not shy away from those issues.|$|E
500|$|The playwright William Shakespeare {{had already}} used the {{family history of}} Northumberland's family in his Henry IV series of plays, and {{the events of the}} Gunpowder Plot seem to have {{featured}} alongside the earlier Gowrie conspiracy in Macbeth, written some time between 1603 and 1607. [...] Interest in the demonic was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot. The King had become engaged in the great debate about other-worldly powers in writing his Daemonology in 1597, before he became King of England as well as Scotland. [...] Inversions seen in such lines as [...] "fair is foul and foul is fair" [...] are used frequently, and another possible reference to the plot relates to the use of equivocation; Garnett's A Treatise of Equivocation was found on one of the plotters. [...] Another writer influenced by the plot was John Milton, who in 1626 wrote what one commentator has called a [...] "critically vexing poem", In Quintum Novembris. [...] Reflecting [...] "partisan public sentiment on an English-Protestant national holiday", in the published editions of 1645 and 1673 the poem is preceded by five epigrams {{on the subject of the}} Gunpowder Plot, apparently written by Milton in preparation for the larger work. [...] The <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> also have influenced his later work, Paradise Lost.|$|E
500|$|CNN's Lisa Respers France {{said the}} episode {{failed to meet}} her expectations. She was {{concerned}} that Mercedes' <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted [...] "all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the [...] "maniacal behavior" [...] of Sue. McNutt wrote, [...] "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not {{a step in the}} right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none." [...] He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN was {{positive}} about [...] "Homer The Whopper", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He {{commented that the}} first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker. Canning believed {{the reason for this}} was that the viewers have already seen Homer [...] "struggle with his weight countless times, and Rogen's trainer, though funny much of the time, will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role." [...] He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find [...] "a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss." [...] Overall, Canning thought [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> not be very original, the writers added [...] "freshness to the proceedings." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais', but commented that Rogen and Goldberg [...] "managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere." [...] He added that he thought the Hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on the show, but [...] "the specificity of what the [...] was making fun of—trainers who help stars slim down (in this case, helping Homer slim down)—went a long way toward making the episode palatable." [...] VanDerWerff concluded that while the episode [...] "didn’t try anything new , [...] had fun with it all the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{positive}} {{and focused on the}} novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "A burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds. The convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes no good for him. But somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him, when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement, and the reason for all this melee, in which the whole countryside took part, becomes apparent." [...] The requirement that the fleeing [...] "convict" [...] be continually assisted {{as a part of the}} <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> have been lost on The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer. The reviewer writes, [...] "Perhaps, in real life, things might not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage, the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him. Even then, Fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up her sleeve. In the film, at any rate, everybody bit nicely. They pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising. There they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and, no doubt, enjoyed it hugely. They did if it was as good as the film is. The least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials; but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News identified the set up and assistance to [...] "the convict" [...] and states,"In spite of the Thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume, not used in this state for some two years, the audience did not 'catch on.' When the revelation came, at the door of the New Rochelle picture show, the theatre rang with laughter. We were all 'stung' and we enjoyed it." ...|$|E

Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observers issue of 5 November 1939 which began, [...] "No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a [...] trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers {{is one of the}} very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure." [...] After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, [...] "Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Propp {{broke up}} fairy tales into {{sections}}. Through these sections {{he was able}} to define the tale into a series of sequences that occurred within the Russian fairytale. Usually there is an initial situation, after which the tale usually takes the following 31 functions. Propp used this method to decipher Russian folklore and fairy tales. First of all, there seems to be at least two distinct types of structural analysis in folklore. One is the [...] "syntagmatic" [...] manner of assessment (as termed following Lévi-Strauss 1964: 312), covering Propp's Morphology among others in which the structure of a piece folklore is described in the chronological order of the linear events it comprises. If a tale consists of elements A to Z, the structure of the tale is thus delineated in the same sequence. The other type of analysis is termed [...] "paradigmatic" [...] (cf. Sebag 1963:75), and describes instead the underlying pattern (usually based upon a priori binary principle of opposition) of the folkloric text, independent of chronology. Elements of the <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> be taken out of their [...] "given" [...] order and regrouped in various analytic schemes.|$|E

As he departed, Gray ordered the destruction of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) village of Opitsitah (Opitsaht). The attack was a retaliation for insults he thought he had endured and in response to rumors of a plot against his men conceived by some local natives and a Sandwich Islander of his own crew. The <b>plot</b> <b>may</b> have been real, but might have been a misunderstanding.

Fortunately, it was deserted at the time. John Boit, the keeper of his own ship's log, wrote that Gray had let his passions go too far. In 2005, descendants of Gray formally apologized for the destruction of Opitsaht. Gray ordered several other attacks during the 1792 voyage. In May 1792, Gray ordered an attack on a Chicklisaht Nuu-chah-nulth village in Esperanza Inlet or Nasparti Inlet north of Nootka Sound, killing seven and seizing the natives' sea otter furs. The Chicklisaht took their wounded to the Spanish post at Nootka Sound and asked the commandant, Bodega y Quadra, to punish Gray. This attack came after a breakdown in trading negotiations. The price of sea otter furs had increased dramatically since the late 1780s. Gray was {{one of a number of}} captains who decided to use force to acquire furs. Later in 1792, in Grays Harbor, Captain Gray fired on a group of Chinooks, killing 20. Still later, in Clayoquot Sound again, Gray killed or wounded at least 25 natives who were approaching his ship in a war canoe during the night. He battled a group of Kwakiutls in late 1792.|$|E
