40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple model that formalizes {{a variant of}} Ohanian's (2001) {{conjecture}} explaining the productivity declines observed in the Great Depression. If a large payment shock like an asset-price collapse renders many firms insolvent, other economic agents become exposed to {{a higher risk of}} not being paid (<b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty).</b> The <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> causes endogenous disruptions of the division of labor among firms, thereby lowering macroeconomic productivity. The prediction of the model is that productivity correlates negatively with bankruptcies and positively with the cost share of intermediate inputs, which is consistent with the data from depression episodes. The model implies that the so-called failure of macroeconomic policy in the United States during the early 1930 s, when a rash of bankruptcies occurred, could actually have been welfare enhancing, since the quick exit of insolvent agents can resolve <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> quickly.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} going to {{quantify}} the mitigation of the insurance as a risk mitigant in operational risk management for the commercial bank. Due to the uncertainties associated with the insurance policy, such as counterparty default, <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and the liquidity risk (i. e., delayed payment), the recovery amounts are subjected {{to be kind of}} uncertainty. Thus, the efficiency of insurance as a risk mitigant may be discounted. We aim at going one step further to consider counterparty default, <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and liquidity risk. While the counterparty default model focuses on calibration of the default time, the <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is set as a non-increasing function depending on loss severity. The key conclusions are that counterparty default does not have significant impact on the capital calibration but still paramount in risk management, and insurance as a risk mitigant indeed improve the operational risk profile of bank and lower the capital requirement to some extent...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to set a complete ex-ante evaluation to support Decision Makers in designing more efficient and effective agri-environmental contracts, through an integrated modelling of elements of private and public decision making. Ex-ante comparison of policy design options in terms of overall effectiveness requires both simulations of farmers' behaviour and evaluation of the farms simulations outcomes. An intermediate step is the aggregation of single farms impacts at territorial level, in order to identify the aggregate impact of each alternative. Alternatives are several contract design, based on different levels of payments. Farm level analysis is based on a real options approach including in the simulations the timing of choice and the uncertainty in the future about price and decoupled payments. Aggregate policy impact is identified through the quantification of economic, social and environmental impacts at territorial level and the weights are elicited with Multiple-Criteria Robust Interactive Decision Analysis (MCRID). Simulations in the case study show that relevant opportunities to improve policy design are available. Multicriteria Analysis is then used to aggregate impacts of many criteria, including not only effects on the environment, but also economic and social impacts.

Taking into account different representations of actor interaction as described by different eco-systems by different policy forums the main research question to be discussed in the paper is: Can policies or standards describing actor roles and responsibilities for technical innovations like mobile payments remove obstacles for introduction of the innovation? Different types of industry forums are not only involved in strictly technical matters but also discuss and describe “visions” about how a new technique might be applied in business life. They suggest different “business architectures”, (not only a “technical architecture”), where roles of different type of actors and relations between actors are outlined based on ideas about so called “eco-systems”. Against this background the paper first discusses how NFC enabled mobile payments currently attracts a lot of attention and identifies four possible development paths “making it happen”. The paper discusses and compares how global policy networks describe the technical and business architectures for mobile payments.

40|$|Letters {{of credit}} remain an {{important}} tool for financing and settling international trade transactions. They enjoy wide acceptance in the trading community because they are considered to carry low financial risk. Letters of credit are subject to specific rules that were first codified by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 1929 and since updated on a regular basis. In October 2006, the ICC announced that a new revision of these rules, the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 2007 Revision (UCP 600), would become effective from 1 July 2007. In this paper, a contextual background to the contracts and mechanisms emanating from letter of credit transactions is firstly provided, followed by discussion of both select major changes to the existing rules and the challenges associated with their implementation. Comments on other associated rules that may impact on the UCP 600 are also incorporated in the discussion. The paper concludes that the ICC’s revision of the UCP 600 has, in some respects, resulted in improvements over current rules, however these may not produce the desired effects, because of the imprecise definition of international standard banking practices leading, in particular, to <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for exporters...|$|E

A plethora of measures have been formulated and implemented to promote development of domestic contractors in these countries, but most attempts have achieved little success. This paper, arising from a larger study on management training needs of contractors in Nigeria, describes findings on constraints on indigenous contractors' performance in the Nigerian industry. Contractor-development programmes perceived as relevant and appropriate to improve their performance in the industry are also reported. The views of indigenous contractors and professionals were compared. There was a strong agreement between both groups on the major constraints in the industry and on the measures perceived as most important for the development of Nigerian contractors. Problems emanating from the business environment were generally perceived by both groups as the most severe constraints. Contractor-development programmes, perceived as very important by both groups, are also the measures required to ameliorate the most important constraints identified: obtaining interim <b>payments,</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in supplies and prices of materials, inadequate access to capital, plant and equipment. Contractor development is inevitably an integral part of a construction industry development programme, given the nature of constraints and development needs emphasized by both groups. The focus therefore should be on establishing a comprehensive programme {{for the development of the}} construction industry. More attention should be placed on contractor training to promote management development of trained construction professionals, now emerging as the new crop of construction entrepreneurs.

Alternatively to direct payments, the production effect of tax reductions is evaluated in order to determine its magnitude. The empirical analysis corroborates the theoretical results of the literature and demonstrates that tax reductions are also distorting, but to a substantially lesser degree if losses are not offset. However, tax reductions, independently whether losses are offset or not, lead to higher government spending than pure direct payment...|$|R
40|$|Expectation of owner payment {{punctuality}} and completeness is {{of primary}} concern to a contractor before it commits {{to a new}} project. When payments are delayed or less than expected, the contractor's financial position and project performance are affected. This thesis proposes a number of analytical tools for contractors to anticipate and deal with late and incomplete payments. These tools allow contractors to estimate payment probability, plot cash flow and analyse different claim/payment strategies. The analytical tools also apply to subcontractors receiving payments from contractors, and to consultants receiving payments from owners or contractors. Initiating from an existing Markov chain formulation of contractor payments, the thesis presents a tree form classification model of owner payment practices. Following the splits of the tree, each owner payment profile ends {{up in one of}} ten terminal nodes, corresponding to ten owner payment types ranging from the worst to the best. A sensitivity study and test of the stationarity hypothesis of the Markov chain formulation of contractor payments is presented to reinforce the validity of the Markov chain formulation. The likelihood of payment to subcontractors, which are subject to double <b>payment</b> <b>uncertainties</b> associated with owners and contractors, is modelled. Suggestions are made to subcontractors to calculate the age-dependent probabilities of outstanding claim amounts being paid based on contractor and owner typical payment behaviour. The payment lateness and incompleteness associated with each owner type is used in an example to establish the cash flow forecast of a future project. Present worth analysis is performed to assess the feasibility of a project, based on different mark-ups and payment policies to lower level creditors. The classification of owner payment behaviour is incorporated in an overall multi-criteria owner evaluation framework. This framework allows contractors to understand owner characteristics, and consequently aid the mitigation of risks associated with working with owners. This thesis is an original contribution to current contractor's risk analysis practices and an extension of existing contractor claim-payment analysis. It will potentially help improve contractor's cash flow management, reduce project failures and {{contribute to the development of}} the construction industry in general...|$|R

The timing depends on the initial reputation of the government, the costs of taxing labour income, {{and the costs of}} defaulting on government debt, which are endogenized {{as a function of the}} redistributive preferences of the government.

Using a combination of propensity score and Mahalanobis matching I analyse wage differentials and find that on-call workers receive compensation for providing quantity flexibility. Compensation of fixed-term contracts on the other hand is dominated by the negative wage effect of quality uncertainty. I investigate whether this relation still holds after the 1999 policy change that had a substantial impact on the attractiveness of on-call and fixed-term workers from the employers perspective. I find that the policy change has not only influenced the use of on-call and fixed-term contracts, but unintentionally also their compensation. temporary employment; wage differentials; uncertainty...|$|R

In particular, it assesses the influence of supermarket-driven supply chains and of immigration status on these experiences. This thus reveals a labour process which is strongly shaped by structural factors, yet workers’ agency is also shown {{to play an important}} part. The analysis is organised around working and living spaces. It first explores the living spaces of the camp in which migrant workers were required to reside {{as a result of the}} conditions attached to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. Such conditions, it is argued, give rise to both social and physical enclosure and thus to employers’ control of migrant workers. Secondly, the thesis focuses on everyday work spaces, illustrating how migrants’ work efforts are influenced by two features of production operating in UK food supply chains: just in time and total quality control. The role of surveillance and technology are shown to be important in habituating migrants’ bodies and their work efforts. The analysis of spaces of work also reveals how the piece rate form of <b>payment</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> over rates of pay are used to gain workers’ consent and intensification of work effort. Moreover, it contributes to understanding of the bodily effects of that effort. The thesis further explores leisure and consumption spaces away from the camp. These can be sites of stigma, racism and exclusion and simultaneously reveal the working of a transnational social field. The analysis of these spaces provides evidence of how immigration status and nationality can shape both migrants’ own identities and how others perceive them...|$|R

We focused on the (relatively narrow) pre-crisis sample and ignored wealth accumulation and health issues.

Future analysis should address the aspects that we have excluded from consideration in our first attempt (the role of the business cycle, redundancy <b>payments</b> and the <b>uncertainty</b> created by ever-changing pension rules). By extending the reference sample, our findings will progressively approximate full population predictions. Nevertheless, we view our results as a robust minimum bound on the extension of voluntary non-participation and as a first policy proposal on what action may be taken to mitigate this issue. Another avenue for future improvement involves general equilibrium considerations: our partial equilibrium analysis detaches itself from the impact of institutional changes on prices and labor demand. It is highly unlikely that the induced second-round effects of the reforms would change our qualitative conclusions, but they would most certainly affect our quantitative answers.|$|R
