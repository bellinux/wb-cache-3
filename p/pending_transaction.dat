40|$|We propose signature-accelerated {{transactional}} memory (SigTM), {{a hybrid}} TM system {{that reduces the}} overhead of software transactions. SigTM uses hardware signatures to track the read-set and write-set for <b>pending</b> <b>transactions</b> and perform conflict detection between concurrent threads. All other transactional functionality, including data versioning, is implemented in software. Unlike previously proposed hybrid TM systems, SigTM requires no modifications to the hardware caches, which reduces hardware cost and simplifies support for nested transactions and multithreaded processor cores. SigTM is also the first hybrid TM system to provide strong isolation guarantees between transactional blocks and nontransactional accesses without additional read and write barriers in non-transactional code. Using a set of parallel programs that make frequent use of coarsegrain transactions, we show that SigTM accelerates software transactions by 30 % to 280 %. For certain workloads, SigTM can match {{the performance of a}} full-featured hardware TM system, while for workloads with large read-sets it can be up to two times slower. Overall, we show that SigTM combines the performance characteristics and strong isolation guarantees of hardware TM implementations with the low cost and flexibility of software TM systems...|$|R

A front running firm either buys for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its own customers, the block trade, or the public market.|$|E

This paper develops a general solution for these problems, at a level of abstraction transparent to guest VMs and their device drivers. A key part of this solution is a novel VMMlevel abstraction that transparently handles <b>pending</b> I/O <b>transactions,</b> termed Netchannel. Netchannel provides for (1) virtual device migration and device hot-swapping for networked as well as locally attached devices, and (2) remote access to devices not directly attached to networks via transparent device remoting, an example being a disk locally present on a bladeserver node. A Xen-based prototype of Netchannel demonstrates these capabilities for block and for USB devices, for both bulk and isochronous USB access methods. Within the same administrative domain, seamless access to these devices is maintained during live VM migration and during device hotswapping. Experimental evaluations with micro-benchmarks and with representative server applications exhibit comparable performance for Netchannel-based remote vs. local devices...|$|R

40|$|In {{any large}} {{corporate}} acquisition, {{there is an}} interim period between {{the time that the}} parties enter into a merger agreement and the time the transaction is effected and the purchase price paid. During this period, the business of the acquired company may deteriorate, thus raising {{the question of whether the}} counterparty must perform on the agreement and pay the purchase price. Merger agreements typically address this problem through 2 ̆ 2 material adverse change 2 ̆ 2 (MAC) clauses, which provide that a party may walk away from the transaction without penalty if the counterparty has suffered a MAC. Although the definition of MAC is usually very complex and intensely negotiated, when a company 2 ̆ 7 s business has deteriorated between the signing and closing of a deal, the parties will often disagree about whether the impairment amounts to a MAC within the meaning of the agreement. MAC clauses have thus given rise to more litigation than any other provision of merger agreements, and the amounts in controversy in such cases have often been spectacular. With the fate of transactions worth tens of billions of dollars turning on the proper interpretation of MAC clauses, the economic functioning of MA C clauses is therefore crucially important to the market for corporate control. MAC clauses usually identify various kinds of risks to the company 2 ̆ 7 s business that may arise during the interim period and assign some of those risks to one party and some to the other. The economic theory of contract law suggests that such allocations will be efficient; for example, that risks will be assigned to cheaper cost avoiders or superior risk bearers. In order to investigate the efficient allocation of risk under MAC clauses, this Article reports the results of an empirical study of MAC clauses in 353 transactions involving public companies in the United States announced between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, classifying such transactions by the form of consideration paid (i. e., cash, stock, or a mix of both). On the basis of this study, this Article identifies four kinds of risks typically allocated in MAC clauses: (a) systematic risks, such as broad economic or market factors affecting firms generally; (b) indicator risks, which are risks that the company in question will not meet predetermined measures of its financial performance, such as internal projections or estimates by industry analysts; (c) agreement risks, such as attrition of employees or loss of customers arising from the announcement of the agreement; and (d) business risks, the kinds of risks that arise in the ordinary course of the company 2 ̆ 7 s operations, such as large environment liabilities for a petroleum company. The study shows that in both cash mergers, and stock-for-stock and cash-and- stock transactions, although business risks are allocated to the party itself, systematic risks and agreement risks are generally allocated to the contractual counterparty. Although indicator risks more often than not stay with the party itself, they are shifted to the counterparty in a significant minority of agreements. The allocation of business risks to the party itself is readily explicable in terms of the party being either the cheaper cost avoider or superior risk bearer of such risks. The efficient allocation of systematic risks to counterparties, however, turns out to be very difficult to explain. In particular, in both stock-for-stock and cash-and- stock mergers, MAC clauses usually contain reciprocal provisions that shift systematic risks between the parties so that, during the interim period, parties often bear each other 2 ̆ 7 s systematic risks. Neither party can plausibly be thought to be the cheaper cost avoider or superior risk bearer with respect to such risks of the other party, especially when the risks of very large acquirers are shifted to relatively small targets. This risk-swapping phenomenon thus requires another explanation. The solution lies in realizing that, when MAC clauses allocate systematic risks to the counterparty, the party is relieved not only of the systematic risk itself but also of an additional but related risk: namely, the risk that the counterparty will declare (either honestly or opportunistically) that the party has been MAC 2 ̆ 7 d by the materialization of the risk. This additional risk is significant because it is much worse for a party to be declared MAC 2 ̆ 7 d by its counterparty on the basis of a materializing risk than just to suffer the materialization of that risk. A public dispute about whether the company has been MAC 2 ̆ 7 d exacerbates the disruption of its business that the <b>pending</b> <b>transaction</b> has already caused; imperils its relations with employees, customers, creditors, and others with whom it does business; publicly releases negative information about the company that otherwise would have remained confidential; exposes the company to disparagement by the counterparty; and, if the dispute is litigated, can even lead to a public certification by a court that the company is, in effect, damaged goods. All of these additional risks can be completely eliminated by shifting the underlying systematic risk to the counterparty. With the counterparty bearing the risk, it has no incentive to declare a MAC based on the materialization of the risk. The allocation of such risks in typical MAC clauses is thus efficient, not because the risks being shifted in such clauses can be borne more efficiently by the parties to whom they are shifted, but because, in the act of shifting them, different but related risks arising from the acquisition process itself are being eliminated. The shifting of agreement and indicator risks, though not entirely parallel, can be explained in related ways...|$|E

40|$|Most mergers filed at the {{enforcement}} agencies are conglomerate in nature with only minor horizontal overlaps.

Hence, the agency’s actions are not fully checked by the threat of litigation. This paper explores whether the FTC’s decisions to challenge conglomerate transactions that could feasibly settle differ from the controlling case law. We find that the representative enforcement regimes are remarkably similar, though the FTC is more accepting of efficiencies arguments, while the court considers buyer sophistication as a mitigating factor. In aggregate, the differences generally cancel out leaving comparable levels of enforcement.

40|$|Asset {{securitization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important financial innovations recently. With an impressive growth in terms of volume of issuance, from almost zero to five trillion USD, in a period of 15 - 20 years, it {{is one of the}} most rapidly growing markets in the financial world. Yet, little is known about this, literally invisible market. Companies engage in asset securitization for a variety of reasons and numerous advantages and disadvantages of asset securitization can be found throughout the literature. Asset securitization has an impact on a number of stakeholder groups: shareholders, managers, employees, investors, the financial markets and ultimately the overall economy and society. Asset securitization is one of the reasons for the financial crisis that started in mid 2007. Since the recent financial turmoil, it became clear the asset securitization was the primary funding source for companies in the financial industry and it was the primary supplier of credit in developed economies. Because of its importance and impact, it is very important that we study the reasons, the motivations, the consequences and the effects from this so powerful financial innovation. And it is important to study it from as many different aspects as possible. Many questions surrounding asset securitization are unanswered and it is important to answer them sooner. This study investigates the wealth effects from asset securitization on the shareholders of the securitizing companies. We study whether the announcement about a <b>pending</b> securitization <b>transaction</b> has any impact on the stock price of the securitizing company. That way we can discover whether asset securitization creates wealth, destroys wealth or has no impact on wealth at all. Not many studies have been done on this topic so far. The existing seven studies are focused mainly on the US and the EU market and report contradicting results. In this study, for the first time, data from Australia is being used. The Australian securitization market is the second, single most active securitization market in the world, after the US market. We conduct quantitative analysis on a sample of 98 securitization transactions during the period 2000 - 2006. With this sample, we cover almost 29 % of the number of securitization transactions during that period and almost 39 % in terms of volume of issuance. To analyze the data we use standard event study methodology, common for this type of studies.    Our analysis reveals that investors in Australia do not perceive asset securitization favorably. Securitizing companies’ stock price decreases in the 10 days around the securitization announcement day, resulting in statistically significant wealth losses for the originating companies’ shareholders. Furthermore, the wealth losses are significant for less frequent securitizers, for securitizers that engage in small volume securitization transactions and for securitizing companies with low asset quality.    With this study we make theoretical and practical contribution. We lend empirical support to the previous theories and we help managers, shareholders and investors shape their forecasts. ...|$|R

60|$|The famous set of {{pictures}} called “Marriage à la Mode”, {{and which are}} exhibited at Marlborough House [1853], in London, contains {{the most important and}} highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old earl. Pride and pomposity appear in every accessory surrounding the earl. He sits in gold lace and velvet—as how should such an earl wear anything but velvet and gold lace? His coronet is everywhere: on his footstool on which reposes one gouty toe turned out; on the sconces and looking-glasses; on the dogs; on his lordship’s very crutches; on his great chair of state and the great baldaquin behind him; under which he sits pointing majestically to his pedigree, which shows that his race is sprung from the loins of William the Conqueror, and confronting the old alderman from the City, who has mounted his sword for the occasion, and wears his alderman’s chain, and has brought a bag full of money, mortgage-deeds, and thousand-pound notes, for the arrangement of the <b>transaction</b> <b>pending</b> between them. Whilst the steward (a Methodist, therefore a hypocrite and cheat, for Hogarth scorned a Papist and a Dissenter) is negotiating between the old couple, their children sit together, united but apart. My lord is admiring his countenance in the glass, while his bride is twiddling her marriage ring on her pocket-handkerchief; and listening with rueful countenance to Counsellor Silvertongue, who has been drawing the settlements. The girl is pretty, but the painter, with a curious watchfulness, has taken care to give her a likeness to her father, as in the young viscount’s face you see a resemblance to the earl, his noble sire. The sense of the coronet pervades the picture, as it is supposed to do the mind of its wearer. The pictures round the room are sly hints indicating the situation of the parties about to marry. A martyr is led to the fire; Andromeda is offered to sacrifice; Judith is going to slay Holofernes. There is the ancestor of the house (in the picture it is the earl himself as a young man), with a comet over his head, indicating that the career of the family is to be brilliant and brief. In the second picture, the old lord must be dead, for madam has now the countess’s coronet over her bed and toilet-glass, and sits listening to that dangerous Counsellor Silvertongue, whose portrait now actually hangs up in her room, whilst the counsellor takes his ease on the sofa by her side, evidently the familiar of the house, and the confidant of the mistress. My lord takes his pleasure elsewhere than at home, whither he returns jaded and tipsy from the “Rose”, to find his wife yawning in her drawing-room, her whist-party over, and the daylight streaming in; or he amuses himself with the very worst company abroad, whilst his wife sits at home listening to foreign singers, or wastes her money at auctions, or, worse still, seeks amusement at masquerades. The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counsellor, who kills him, and is apprehended whilst endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the alderman in the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue’s dying speech at Tyburn, where the counsellor has been executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral:—Don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counsellors: don’t marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money: don’t frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband: don’t have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.

Transaction-based bandwidth management The designed Transaction-Based Bandwidth Management Scheme (TB-BMS) operates at application-level and intelligently allocates the bandwidth by monitoring the profit oriented sensitivity variations in the transactions, which are linked with various profit profiles created over type, time, and history of transactions. The scheme mainly consists of transaction classifier, bandwidth determination and transactions scheduling modules. We have deployed these scheme over a downlink of HWNs, since the uplink caries simple quires from customers to superstore server. The scheme uses transaction scheduling algorithm, which decides how to schedule an outgoing transaction based on its priority with efficient use of available BW. As we observe, not all superstore transactions can have the same profit sensitive information, data size and operation type. Therefore, we classify the superstore transactions into four levels based on profit, data size, operation type and the degree of severity of information that they are handling. The aim of transaction classification module is to find the transaction sensitivity level(TSL) for a given transaction. The bandwidth determination module estimates bandwidth requirement for each of the transactions. The transactions scheduling module schedules the transactions based on availability of bandwidth as per the TSL of the transaction. The scheme schedules the highest priority transactions first, keeping the lowest priority <b>transaction</b> <b>pending.</b> If all the highest priority transactions are over, then it continues with next priority level transactions, and so on, in every slot. We have simulated the hybrid wireless superstore network environment with WiFi and GSM technologies. We simulated four TSL levels with different bandwidth. The simulation under consideration uses different transactions with different bandwidth requirements. The performance results describe that the proposed scheme considerably improves the bandwidth utilization by reducing transaction blocking and accommodating more essential transactions at the peak time of the business. Transaction-based resource management In the next work, we have proposed the transaction-based resource management scheme (TB-RMS) to allocate the required resources among the various customer services based on priority of transactions. The scheme mainly consists of transaction classifier, resource estimation and transactions scheduling modules. This scheme also uses a downlink transaction scheduling algorithm, which decides how to schedule an outgoing transaction based on its priority with efficient use of available resources. The transaction-based resource management {{is similar to that of}} TB-BMS scheme, except that the scheme estimates the resources like buffer, bandwidth, processing time for each of transaction rather than bandwidth. The performance results indicate that the proposed TB-RMS scheme considerably improves the resource utilization by reducing transaction blocking and accommodating more essential transactions at the peak time. Transaction-based Quality of Service management In the third segment, we have proposed a police-based transaction-aware QoS management architecture for the downlink QoS management. We derive a policy for the estimation of QoS parameters, like, delay, jitter, bandwidth, transaction loss for every transaction before scheduling on the downlink. We use Policy-based Transaction QoS Management(PTQM) to achieve the transaction based QoS management. Policies are rules that govern a transaction behavior, usually implemented in the form of if(condition) then(action) policies. The QoS management scheme is fully centralized, and is based on the ideas of client-server interaction. Each mobile terminal is connected to a server via WiFi or GSM. The master policy controller (MPDF) connects to the policy controller of the WiFi network (WPDF) and the GSM policy controller(PDF). We have considered the simulation environment similar to earlier schemes. The results shows that the policy-based transaction QoS management is improves performance and utilizes network resources efficiently at the peak time of the superstore business. Transactions-Aware Topology Management(TATM) Finally, we have proposed a topology management scheme to the superstore hybrid wireless networks. A wireless topology management that manages the activities and features of a wireless network connection. It may control the process of selecting an available access points, authentication and associating to it and setting up other parameters of the wireless connection. The proposed topology management scheme consists of the transaction classifier, resource estimation module, network availability and status module and transaction-aware topology management module. The TATM scheme is to select the best network among available networks to provide transaction response(or execution). We have simulated hybrid wireless superstore network with five WiFi and two GSM technologies. The performance results indicate that the transaction-based topology management scheme utilizes the available resources efficiently and distributed transaction loads evenly in both WiFi and GSM networks based on the capacity...|$|R
