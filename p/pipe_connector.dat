5000|$|Ernest Bradfer {{was born}} in Nantois on 29 March 1833.His father was Jean-Baptiste Bradfer (1808-88).Ernest was educated in Nancy, Bar-le-Duc, Paris and then Strasbourg.The Bradfers were both ironmasters and {{industrialists}} in Naix-aux-Forges and Bar-le-Duc.In 1859 they partnered with the ironmaster Joseph-Bernard Viry and his son Louis to open a foundry and blast furnace in Bar-le-Duc. In 1866 they bought out Viry and the Bradfer-Viry company became Bradfer père et fils (Bradfer Father & Son). It produced iron piping for water and gas. Ernest then bought the mines in Maron, Meurthe-et-Moselle.In 1876 they joined with Antoine Aubin Durenne, who owned the patent for the Lavril <b>pipe</b> <b>connector,</b> and founded [...] "Bradfer et fils & Cie A.A.

50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the <b>pipe</b> <b>connector</b> onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} procedure is developed which incorporates a thermodynamically derived constitutive law for {{shape memory alloy}} material behavior. The constitutive equations include the necessary internal variables {{to account for the}} material transformations and are utilized in a one-dimensional finite eelement procedure that captures the unique shape memory alloy responses of pseudoelasticity and of the shape memory effect at all temperatures, stress levels andloading conditions. Detailed material properties for the alloy used are necessary for the analysis. The solution of the geometrically andphysically nonlinear problem is achieved by application of a Newton'smethod in which a sequence of linear problems is numerically solved. Due to consistent linearization, a quadratic rate of convergence is obtained. Several test cases are presented to illustrate the potential of the finite element procedure. Cases simulating the stress-strain behavior of a bar of shape memory alloy under simple uniaxial loading as well as restrained recovery responses at different temperatures compare well with experimental and analytical results. Two further generalizued applications are examined: the use of a shape memory alloy ring as a <b>pipe</b> <b>connector</b> and eigenfrequency tuning of a composite beam with embedded shape memory wires. The results of these analyses correlate well with analytical results and the methodology for the incorporation of the finite element procedureinto general cases is demonstrated.

Increase of productivity {{and quality of}} this construction work requires improvement of both concrete pumps and their tooling. The concrete pumps tooling consists of standardized concrete conveying <b>pipes</b> and <b>connector</b> bends radius of up to 2 m.

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of developing and implementing connector bends with radius greater than 2 m. Methodology. The criterion of efficiency in using bends with radius of more than 2 m in <b>connector</b> concrete <b>pipes</b> is reduction of resistance to movement of the concrete, enhancing the productivity of concrete pumps.

30|$|Typically, {{hydrocarbon}} production networks have several fluid routing alternatives that are applied by {{opening and closing}} on–off valves. This usually sends the wells’ fluids through a specific pipeline, pump or compressor, or to a particular separator, among other requirements. This paper presents a general methodology to compute all fluid routing configurations of a production network using a graph representation of it. The particular implementation case discussed in this paper involves interacting with a preexisting steady-state computational model of the production network. The method starts by extracting from the model the name list of elements in the network and their type. Equipment (wells, separators, junctions, pumps, compressors, valves, etc.) is tagged as nodes and <b>pipes</b> (flowlines, <b>connectors)</b> are tagged as edges. The nodes are further classified by type: sources (wells), internals (e.g., junctions) or sinks (separators). The start and end element of each edge is recorded. This process yields a network connectivity list. A depth-first search is executed from each source to each sink. The search keeps track of the edges that must be active in each path and honors (if any) pre-specified edge directions. All paths for one source node in one component are combined to form all feasible edge combinations for that source node, and these combinations are again combined for all the source nodes in each component. This is repeated for all graph components. The unique combinations are stored and reported at the end. The method has been tried in a production network with seven wells representing a typical subsea production system in the North Sea where the wells {{have the option to}} produce (through two flowlines) to two separators on the platform. The production network model was available in a commercial software; thus, there was no access to the code or the underlying equations. The model was controlled from an external computational routine using automation. The graph was extracted from the model, all operating configurations of the network were computed (2187), and then each one was applied (by enabling or disabling flowlines) and evaluated in the commercial software. This allowed to identify routing configurations that provided maximum total oil production or maximum total gas production. There were only 306 configurations that yielded a total oil production close (within 10 %) to the maximum recorded oil production. The input data of the production system model are given in the appendix for verification and benchmarking by a third party. Details about the implementation are provided.|$|R
