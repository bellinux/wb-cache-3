40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{evaluate}} the investment from an environmental point of view because a trend to look at investment from a non-economic perspective is increasing. The analysed investment is a <b>painting</b> <b>cabin</b> with an efficient filter reducing pollution by 97, 9 %. The impact of the <b>painting</b> <b>cabin</b> is calculated from the company itself and also for population of the village where the company operates. Two kinds of method are used: market and non-market evaluations. The market evaluation is based on estimation of saving of pollution fees and the non-market evaluation means a value of air quality for residents. In this work two non-economic evaluation methods are used: Willingness to pay (WTP) and Willingness to accept (WTA). The conclusion deals with the results of these methods and especially with a difference between them and gives a recommendation how to estimate the value and investment from an environmental point of view by using WTA/WTP methods...|$|E

50|$|Cottagers are {{beginning}} to head north from Muskoka to more wilderness locations such as those found at Algonquin Moose Lodge in South River. Algonquin Moose Lodge is a resort that opened up in 2017. The lodge has accommodations {{for all types of}} budgets and varied accommodations such as a 3,200 square foot custom built log home, a smaller log home (that was original to the property) as well as some smaller cottages and even a tipi. This 32 acre resort is Algonquin's last frontier of unspoiled northern wilderness. A colourful local landmark is the Algonquin Motel, which uses <b>painted</b> <b>cabins</b> and rooms to attract visitors. The motel has been in operation for about seventy years.|$|R

This evaluation has been done in order to assess the occupational exposure to VOCs and to know the working conditions of the cleaners, but also {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} personal protective equipment (PPE), the engineering control and the work practices. The xylenes have been chosen as indicators of exposition because they are the main components in the cleaning solvents used, with a level of concentration between 50...|$|R

Knowing {{of the presence}} of Panay and the merchantmen, the Imperial Japanese Navy requested verification of the order, which was received before the attack began about 13:27 that day. Although there were several large American flags flown on the ship under the command of Lieutenant Commander James J. Hughes, as well as one <b>painted</b> atop the <b>cabin,</b> the Japanese planes continued strafing and bombing. Panay was hit by two of the eighteen 60 kg bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters. The bombing continued until Panay sank at 15:54. Storekeeper First Class Charles L. Ensminger, Standard Oil Tanker Captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded.|$|R
40|$|England's canal network, {{critical}} to the nation's predominance {{in the development of}} modern industry, goes largely unnoticed today except by some scholars of transportation. As I suggest in my introduction, one of the reasons may be that since the Second World War the canals have been cleaned up and turned into an attraction for boaters and tourists. With their brightly <b>painted</b> <b>cabins</b> occupied by families on vacation, the boats, now motorized, glide slowly and silently past the bucolic banks of the canals. These are, in appearance, as originally proposed by the development companies and drawn and engraved for the newspapers: beautiful country spaces to be admired and enjoyed by the public. Another reason may be the exertion of a willful nostalgia: because the comparatively slow-moving canals can appear pre-industrial we choose to think of them that way. These choices have made the English canal system part of a pre-modern England, imagined just as the canals were being built. That England would always stand as "a living emblem" of itself remained for the most part uncontested (putting Cromwell to one side) until the construction of the canals. No narrative was required to explain the meaning of the countryside of estates and villages: they were "taken as a given" and had "no apparent origins". The canals visibly introduced time into what was perceived as an unchanging landscape. Time entered not only in the speed of transport on the canals but also in the factories that ran by the clock and the canals that ran by timetable. The geological layers unearthed in the digging of the canals revealed the passage of eons of time and the instability of the earth itself. Time entered in the movement of people and goods in bustling new towns that were in the interior of the country, made prosperous in part by the access the canals gave them to the seas. There was enthusiasm for the progress of English industry and science, a sense of national pride, and great expectations for the wealth of the country. There was a sense that if the old landscape and the new could not be reconciled, the identity of the nation would be lost. The general ambivalence about the changes the canals would bring began at the top with the landed nobility who first financed and built them. Their desire to extract wealth from their own lands overcame their fear of a dynamic population. Gainsborough, in his Cottage Door paintings, appealed to his audience's sense of nostalgia for the passing of the timeless English landscape at the very moment that the canals were being built and many of them were investing in them. Ambivalence is also present in Constable's attempts to cope with landscapes expressive of both time and space. The desire to return to an almost mythic prior time is palpable and his attempt to leap into the future with The Leaping Horse avoids the issue in the other direction. The heyday of canals, from 1765 to 1835, is the interstice between the early days of modernity in England and modern England in its full-blown glory. It is also a curious period in which the development of one technology, the canal, as it was elaborated in the landscape, propelled two generations of artists to work on the same problem: the visual representation of time and space. If one sets a later date for modernity (which I believe would be incorrect), one has the additional liability of facing a closed system of a time-based society and visual culture. By setting the onset of modernity in the 1760 's, the anxiety and the failure of artists to develop the presence of both time and space in their work. At the very cusp of the period, in a work such as Turner's Dudley, Worcestershire, time does not empty space of meaning, any more than the supremacy of space in pre-modern England truly nullified time...|$|R
