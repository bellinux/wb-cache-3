2500|$|However, did Congress {{have the}} [...] "power to proscribe any opinion or belief {{which has not}} {{manifested}} itself in any overt act"? That raised much more serious constitutional questions, Jackson said. He agreed that [...] "The law sometimes does inquire as to mental state, but only, so far as I recall, when it is incidental to, and determines the quality of, some overt act in question." [...] Citing Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), Jackson observed that the Constitution barred punishment even of the very serious crime of treason unless there was some overt act. But under the majority's decision, Jackson said, [...] "since Congress has never outlawed the <b>political</b> <b>strike</b> itself, the Court must be holding that Congress may root out mere ideas which, even if acted upon, would not result in crime." [...] That was anathema to the Constitution. Agreeing that the Bill of Rights was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought. [...] "I think that, under our system, it is time enough for the law to lay hold of the citizen when he acts illegally, or in some rare circumstances when his thoughts are given illegal utterance. I think we must let his mind alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thatcher was {{committed}} to reducing {{the power of the}} trade unions but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched strikes that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically. [...] The most significant of these was carried out by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). However, Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up coal stocks, and there were no cuts in electric power, unlike 1972. Police tactics during the strike concerned civil libertarians: stopping suspected strike sympathisers travelling towards coalfields when they were still long distances from them, phone tapping as evidenced by Labour's Tony Benn, and a violent battle with mass pickets at Orgreave, Yorkshire. But images of massed militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working, along with the fact that (illegally under a recent Act) the NUM had not held a national ballot to approve strike action. Scargill's policy of letting each region of the NUM call its own strike backfired when nine areas held ballots that resulted in majority votes against striking, and violence against strikebreakers escalated with time until reaching a tipping point with the killing of David Wilkie (a taxi-driver who was taking a strikebreaker to work). The Miners' Strike lasted a full year, March 1984 until March 1985, before the drift of half the miners back to work forced the NUM leadership to give in without a deal. Thatcher had won a decisive victory and the unions never recovered their political power. This aborted <b>political</b> <b>strike</b> marked a turning point in UK politics: no longer could militant unions remove a democratically elected government. It also marked to beginning of a new economic and political culture in the UK based upon small government intervention in the economy and reduced dominance of the trade unions and welfare state.|$|E

Their activities around the book document the editor in a blog. Since the escalation of the financial crisis in autumn 2008, it has come in Europe to {{a significant increase in the}} number of <b>political</b> <b>strikes</b> and general strikes. Increasingly, unions fight back in this way against the prevailing austerity. A breakthrough towards a new policy is not succeeded, however. Nevertheless, general strikes have become key parts of the new constitution of worker resistance and are playing an ever more important role in the struggle for democracy and redistribution in Europe...|$|R

Beaten decisively on its own chosen field, it had abandoned that field and come over to the political field of the socialists; for the general strike was a <b>political</b> <b>strike.</b> Besides, {{organized labor}} had been so badly beaten that it did not care. It joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation. The workers threw down their tools and left their tasks by the millions. Especially notable were the machinists. Their heads were bloody, their organization had apparently been destroyed, yet out they came, along with their allies in the metal-working trades.|$|E

Vinson answered all questions affirmatively. Citing In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945); Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392 (1927); and Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), among others, Vinson noted that the Constitution often permitted otherwise irrelevant beliefs, personal traits, or employment status to be infringed upon in certain, limited circumstances.|$|R
40|$|<b>Political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> are understudied {{modes of}} {{collective}} action despite their being dynamic mobilizations and their growing usage {{around the world}} to challenge capitalist globalization. Traditional conceptions of social movements underemphasize the extent to which class relations and position in the world-system structure political opportunities. The study of <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes,</b> as uniquely powerful class-based collective action, reveals the importance of reintroducing issues of political-economy into social movements research. To examine the social origins and determinants of <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes,</b> I use a mixed-methods approach that includes both comparative case studies and statistical analyses. Arthur Banks' Cross-National Time-Series provides one of the largest, comprehensive data sets collecting national-level information on <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> (i. e. strikes that involve at least 1, 000 workers who are employed by at least two different employees and that target the State, its authority, or its policies) around the world between 1919 and 2010. 	Using bootstrapped negative binomial regressions, I find that core countries experience significantly more <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> than countries in the periphery and semi-periphery. However, this effect decreases over time as the majority of <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> occurring after 1975 occur in the periphery and, to a lesser extent, the semi-periphery due to the onset of neo-liberal capitalist globalization. In contrast to conventional social movement expectations of high-risk actions occurring in weak, non-democratic nations, I find that <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> occur in states that are coherent democracies and have strong capacities to defend themselves militarily from internal and external challengers. Comparative case studies of the five countries with the largest quantities of <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> further reveal that <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> have historically concentrated in nations with histories of military dictatorship and fascism. Lastly, I find that <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> are significantly associated with economic crisis (i. e. unemployment) but not with higher concentrations of social movement organizations (i. e. unions). 	These findings strongly suggest that the occurrence of <b>political</b> mass <b>strikes</b> is highly dependent on the class character of the state (i. e. {{the degree to which the}} state has adopted the functions of capitalist accumulation) and the state's regulation of and intervention in the economy...|$|R

2500|$|Part V of the {{decision}} discussed whether <b>political</b> <b>strikes</b> posed such a significant issue as to permissibly infringe on freedom of speech. Vinson refused to substitute the Court's judgment for the congressional determination {{that this was the}} case. In accepting the authority of government to promote strong unions, Vinson observed, the Court had repeatedly also accepted the authority of government to infringe in sometimes substantial ways upon individual liberties. The Taft-Hartley Act's penalties, Vinson held, were not direct infringements on the freedom to speak and thus not as onerous as infringements the Court had approved in the past. Vinson rejected the suggestion that the statute had not been narrowly drawn. Although legislation could have been enacted which made <b>political</b> <b>strikes</b> themselves unlawful (rather than require anti-communist affidavits), Vinson asserted that: ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{reasoning}} by {{the majority}} in American Communications Association v. Douds has not been well-received by legal scholars. One historian characterized the decision as combining [...] "guilt by association" [...] with the discredited [...] "bad tendency test". One legal scholar has called Vinson's heavy reliance on the Commerce Clause as [...] "implausible". Douds also seems to have got some facts wrong: The <b>political</b> <b>strikes</b> Vinson relied on for examples in the case were not Communist-led but rather routine labor conflicts. The majority (unwittingly or not) believed in a distinctly American myth about a monolithic Communist Party controlled from overseas, endowed {{with the ability to}} deceive American workers, and capable of bringing the nation to its knees through the use of <b>political</b> <b>strikes.</b> Vinson's balancing test had a decidedly pro-government bias, and the decision appeared to undermine a decade's worth of First Amendment decisions. Vinson's claim that the Taft-Hartley Act did not proscribe belief has been called [...] "sophistry." [...] And the majority's claim that any flaws in its approach can be easily rectified by appealing to the Supreme Court was not only scoffed at by Justice Black but has also been sharply criticized by legal scholars.
