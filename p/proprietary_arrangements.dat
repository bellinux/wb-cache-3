40|$|The {{threat posed}} by {{influenza}} pandemics raises serious ethical issues, as well as questions of global health governance. In order to create pre-pandemic vaccines, global health authorities need access to virus from regional outbreaks. But because the countries where these outbreaks occur are unlikely {{to benefit from the}} vaccine, they are sometimes reluctant to share this seed stock, and may try to make <b>proprietary</b> <b>arrangements</b> with pharmaceutical companies, as briefly occurred in Indonesia. Although these arrangements may increase developing countries 2 ̆ 7 access to vaccine, they hamper the global cooperation necessary to prepare for influenza outbreaks. Developing countries, in contrast, point to the United States 2 ̆ 7 decision not to use adjuvants in influenza vaccines with the 2009 H 1 N 1 outbreak, even though this is common in Europe, and it might make tens of millions of individual doses available for donation to developing countries. Similar issues bedevil preparation efforts, particularly concerning advance contracts for vaccines. This paper will examine a number of these challenges, and the global health policies needed to address them, based on Indonesia’s 2007 decision not to share viral samples with the WHO, as well as events during the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic...|$|E
50|$|Water {{treatment}} filters {{that can}} be backwashed include rapid sand filters, pressure filters and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Diatomaceous earth filters are backwashed according to the <b>proprietary</b> <b>arrangement</b> of pumps, valves and filters associated with the filtration system. Slow sand filters and self-cleaning screen filters employ mechanisms other than backwashing to remove trapped particles. To keep water treatment filters functional, {{they have to be}} cleaned periodically to remove particulates. Ineffective backwashing {{is one of the main}} reasons that water treatment filters fail.|$|R
5000|$|The core {{principle}} of the new passive [...] RFID tag design marketed by Omni-ID was that it contained a complex and <b>proprietary</b> [...] <b>arrangement</b> of metal layers within the tag which reflected and boosted the signal broadcast from an RFID reader. This allowed the tag to be read accurately even when placed on metal, on a liquid container, or even when immersed. This was confirmed in independent testing in November, 2008.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{computing}} {{is becoming}} pervasive, {{and with it}} comes the demand for unfettered network access for mobile users. Currently, mobile network access is provided by {{a relatively small number}} of service providers, in part due to the high costs of operating wireless network systems and the accompanying "backbone" architectures. Mobile users have to establish <b>proprietary</b> billing <b>arrangements</b> with their service providers, and are limited to using the wireless networks run by their service provider. The existence of the Internet as the baseline network backbone with its unifying TCP/IP architecture, and the advances in low cost wireless network technology allows for a new means of wireless network access for mobile users. Small scale service providers can simply install low cost wireless network base stations and plug them into the Internet, providing network access to any willing mobile user. The low barriers to entry makes it likely that there will be a large number of service providers [...] ...|$|R
