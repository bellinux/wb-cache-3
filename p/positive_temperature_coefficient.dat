25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (<b>Positive</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|So-called self-resetting fuses use a {{thermoplastic}} conductive element {{known as}} a Polymeric <b>Positive</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (or PPTC) thermistor that impedes the circuit during an overcurrent condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC thermistor is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to low resistance. These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a shorted mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient.</b> This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|E

For both the plutonium and uranium solutions, the feedback coefficient experiences a local minimum near the over/under moderation transition point.

25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E
25|$|Inherent safety. LFTR designs use {{a strong}} {{negative}} temperature coefficient of reactivity to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The first is that thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the graphite moderator, that usually causes a positive contribution to the temperature coefficient. The third effect {{has to do with}} thermal expansion of the fuel. If the fuel overheats, it expands considerably, which, due to the liquid nature of the fuel, will push fuel out of the active core region. In a small (e.g. the MSRE test reactor) or well moderated core this reduces the reactivity. However, in a large, under-moderated core (e.g. the ORNL MSBR design), less fuel salt means better moderation and thus more reactivity and an undesirable <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

40|$|Microflow sensors offer great {{potential}} for applications in microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip systems. However, thermal-based sensors, which are commonly used in modern flow sensing technology, are mainly made of materials with <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> (PTC) and suffer from a self-heating effect and slow response time. Therefore, the design of novel devices and careful selection of materials are required to improve the overall flow sensor performance. In this work we propose graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) {{to be used as}} microflow sensor. Temperature distribution in graphene channel was simulated and the analysis of heat convection was performed to establish the relation between the fluidic flow velocity and the temperature gradient. It was shown that the negative <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (NTC) of graphene could enable the self-protection of the device and should minimize sensing error from currentinduced heating.

2500|$|Many sound {{reinforcement}} loudspeaker systems incorporate protection circuitry, preventing {{damage from}} excessive power or operator error. [...] <b>Positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> resistors, specialized current-limiting light bulbs, and circuit-breakers were used {{alone or in}} combination to reduce driver failures. [...] During the same period, the professional sound reinforcement industry made the Neutrik Speakon NL4 and NL8 connectors the standard input connectors, replacing 1/4" [...] jacks, XLR connectors, and Cannon multipin connectors which are all limited {{to a maximum of}} 15 amps of current.

2500|$|The first {{successful}} light bulb filaments {{were made of}} carbon (from carbonized paper or bamboo). Early carbon filaments had a negative {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the [...] "flashing" [...] process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or [...] "graphitized" [...] filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient,</b> like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of temperature and light intensity on the current-voltage characteristics of polymer-fullerene bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The open-circuit voltage varies linearly with temperature in the range 200 K- 300 K and approaches a value of 930 mV at T= 80 K. Strictly <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> were found for both, the short-circuit current density and the fill factor. These cause the device efficiency to increase steadily with temperature up to T= 330 K. The short-circuit current density increases almost linearly with light intensity. The fill factor is not significantly influenced by the incident light intensity in the temperature range from 260 K to 330 K. At lower temperatures, a negative slope of the fill factor is observed. Since the maximum power point varies sublinearly with light intensity, a decrease of the power efficiency is obtained at light intensities higher than 3 mW/cm 2. ...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{is brought}} forward {{to show that}} at {{concentrations}} of urea high enough to split the egg albumin molecule the solubility changes produced by urea are profoundly modified. The degree of precipitation after dialysis is the net result of two changes produced by the urea: the first, normally spoken of as denaturation, which makes the protein insoluble in dilute solution and the second, a splitting of the molecule which makes it soluble. These two reactions may proceed independently and simultaneously or the second reaction may follow the first, {{taking place in the}} denatured molecule only. In view of the decrease in the opalescence with time, the latter process is more probable. Both of these reactions have <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients,</b> but as the concentration of urea increases the second reaction is more affected by increase in temperature than the first, and consequently the resulting opalescence decreases rather than increases with temperature. This accounts for and explains reports of negative <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of denaturation, when denaturation is measured by the amount of insoluble material found on dilution. The occurrence of these two reactions, one leading to an increase and the other to a decrease in the amount of insoluble protein, should be taken into account when denaturation changes in egg albumin with urea are studied...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of stable}} {{isotopes}} as climate proxies is widely accepted for climate reconstruction. Re-establishing climate signals, e. g. temperature, from isotope values of biological materials requires {{some knowledge of}} the system's response behaviour. The related problems are discussed in conjunction with stable isotopes of two different terrestrial archives: carbon isotope data of tree rings from southern Germany and oxygen isotope data of diatoms from Lake Holzmaar, Germany. Carbon isotope <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Delta delta(13) C/Delta T) derived from tree rings were chosen as an example for non-linear transformation of environmental signals through biological systems explaining negative and <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Thin radial tree ring sections taken from tree rings of different species (poplar, beech and oak) show carbon isotope variations of up to 3 parts per thousand with a characteristic, annually recurring isotope pattern. This behaviour is discussed in view of time resolution, isotope signature conservation {{and the question of}} storage and remobilisation of photosynthates with time. For Lake Holzmaar it is shown that isotope proxy signals derived from diatoms may not be unambiguously translated into abiotic environmental forcing factors, such as for example temperature. Corresponding measurements reveal that the isotopic input signal varies considerably and nonlinearly with temperature. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this paper, we demonstrate that the new 1700 V SPT IGBT achieves the same desirable characteristics as {{the successful}} 1200 V SPT generation. The results presented here show that despite the low on-state and switching losses of 1700 V SPT IGBT, high levels of short circuit withstand capability and switching ruggedness have been realized. In addition, the unique Soft-Punch-Through structure achieves low levels of EMI. In parallel to the 1700 V SPT IGBT, a new fast and soft recovery 1700 V diode has been developed with very low reverse recovery losses and high ruggedness under all operating conditions. Both the 1700 V IGBT and diode exhibit <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the forward voltage drop at nominal currents, making them ideally suited for safe parallel operation in high current modules.

40|$|Abstract. Zener diodes {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} barriers to protect equipment operating in a potentially explosive atmosphere. Although normally not conducting, the zeners must have a high power rating so that their junction temperature meets safety factors when shunting the maximum fuse current. This often requires two or three lower voltage commercial zeners connected in series. Silicon carbide diodes have much higher thermal conductivity and maximum allowed junction temperature, so {{it should be possible}} to use one SiC zener in the place of two or three commercial diodes and/or allow use of higher fuse ratings. Low voltage SiC Zener diodes were fabricated and tested to evaluate potential benefits of their application as a component of intrinsically safe barriers.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the outdoor {{monitoring}} of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) {{with the aim of}} improving the stability and performance of OPVs under real world conditions. This is important as in order for OPVs to become commercially viable they must make the transition from small laboratory cells to larger modules. Over the course of several outdoor monitoring campaigns various types of OPV modules have been benchmarked against a number of other technologies: polycrystalline silicon, cadmium indium diselenide and dye sensitised solar cells. The principal performance parameters are examined in detail, analysing their dependence on irradiance and temperature. OPVs were shown to have <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> for efficiency, ISC and fill factor and a negative <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> for VOC. One of the main causes of degradation is ingress of water and oxygen into the module and subsequent photo-oxidation of the active layer and it was shown that UV filtering would improve stability. To improve the yield of OPVs outdoors, modules were laminated to different corrugated substrates and subjected to indoor characterisation and outdoor monitoring. The corrugated modules were shown to have three advantages: the effective area of the module, allowing for curvature, is reduced which leads to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency per unit area; substantial enhancement at high angles of incidence led to increased output during early morning and evening; under diffuse irradiance performance improved by up to 25...|$|R

Electrical resistivity of the nanocomposite thin films decreased progressively by six orders of magnitude as the carbon volume fraction was increased from 1 % to 10 % and showed a characteristic composite behaviour in the smearing region prior to the percolation threshold. The dominant conduction mechanism was shown to be fluctuation induced tunnelling in the Coulomb gap with an optimum hop energy (Wopt) and a hop distance (Ropt) of about 23. 1 ± 0. 05 meV and 15. 8 ± 0. 04 nm, respectively for a 1 vol% nanocomposite, consistent with the T- 1 / 2 behaviour in the model of Adkins (1989 J.

The NTC parameters, characteristic of thermistor performance of these thin films, indicated that polymer based nanocomposites can potentially be considered for NTC thermistor applications. The materials presently studied, when compared with commercially available ceramic thermistors, were shown to exhibit smaller thermal sensitivity parameters, which originate from their smaller activation energy for charge transport.

A large amount of experimental data was collected. The wafer BJTs were able to block over the rated 600 V in the common-emitter configuration and the TO- 220 BJTs were able to block over the 1200 V rated voltage. In the thermal analysis, it is found out that at higher temperatures the forward and reverse (blocking) characteristics were stable at 100 °C and 200 °C. The transistors show <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of forward voltage (Vf). In general the current gain () characteristics obtained (with VCE = 6 V) were approximately as expected for the BJTs.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. In {{this thesis}} {{advanced}} fuel cycles for the incineration, i. e. deep–burn, of weapons–grade plutonium, reactor–grade plutonium from pressurised light water reactors and reactor–grade plutonium + the associated Minor Actinides in the 400 MWth Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Demonstration Power Plant was simulated with the VSOP 99 / 05 diffusion code. These results were also {{compared to the}} standard 9 g/fuel sphere U/Pu 9. 6 % enriched uranium fuel cycle. The addition of the Minor Actinides to the reactor–grade plutonium caused an unacceptable decrease in the burn–up and thus an unacceptable increase in the heavy metal (HM) content in the spent fuel, which is intended for direct disposal in a deep geological repository, without chemical reprocessing. All the Pu fuel cycles failed the adopted safety limits in that either the maximum fuel temperature of 1130 °C, during normal operation, or the maximum power of 4. 5 kW/sphere was exceeded. All the Pu cycles also produced <b>positive</b> Uniform <b>Temperature</b> Reactivity <b>Coefficients,</b> i. e. the <b>coefficient</b> where the <b>temperature</b> of the fuel and the graphite moderator in the fuel spheres are varied together. these <b>positive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> were experienced at low temperatures, typically below 700 °C. This {{was due to the}} influence of the thermal fission resonance of 241 Pu. The safety performance of the weapons–grade plutonium was the worst. The safety performance of the reactor–grade plutonium also deteriorated when the heavy metal loading was reduced from 3 g/sphere to 2 g or 1 g. In view of these safety problems, these Pu fuel cycles were judged to be not licensable in the PBMR DPP– 400 reactor. Therefore a redesign of the fuel cycle for reactor–grade plutonium, the power conversion system and the reactor geometry was proposed in order to solve these problems.
