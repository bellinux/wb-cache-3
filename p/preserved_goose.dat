40|$|Gout {{arthritis}} is {{a disease}} that attacks the joints due to abnormal purine metabolism. One of the prevention of gout is to avoid consuming foods high in purines such as offal foods, foods that have been <b>preserved,</b> <b>goose</b> meat. Elderly who suffer from gout athritis often have a relapse; {{this is the case}} because it deals with the knowledge and awareness related atrhritis gout sufferers. of the value - the value of health or health behaviors so that, still play an optimal role in the provision of health education. This study as a research plan Quasi Experiment using pre-test and post-test control group design. Collection date usid a questionnaire while the test data analysis using Independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test. The test results Independent sample t-test pre-test treatment group and control group (p-value = 0. 112). Post-test treatment group and control group (p-value = 0. 001). The test results pairet sample t-test pre-test and post-test control group (p-value = 0. 770), while the pre-test and post-test (p-value = 0. 001) treatment group. Conclusion of the study is the level of knowledge about the disease gout arthritis before health education about gout diet is largely lacking and pretty, the level of knowledge about the disease gout arthritis after health education about gout diet is largely good, while the elderly who do not receive health education is largely self and there are significant health education about gout diet to decrease the knowledge about the disease gout arthritis in elderly Posyandu elderly Bagas Kartasura Sane...|$|E

5000|$|After the Second World War, West Germany {{abandoned}} the goose step {{in favor of}} a Western march step. East Germany <b>preserved</b> the <b>goose</b> step and renamed it the [...] "drilling step" [...] (exerzierschritt) to avoid references to old Prussian and Wehrmacht military traditions. The 200-year German tradition of goose stepping finally ended with German reunification in 1990, as East German forces were absorbed into the Bundeswehr and conformed to West German military customs. Although goose-stepping has no official sanction, the practice is not illegal in Germany. Some civilian marching bands and riflemen's associations continue to goose-step while others dropped it altogether.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas {{are expected to}} play {{a prominent role in}} the conservation of marine resources and fisheries management. In the Basque Country (northern Spain) the small Marine Reserve of Gaztelugatxe (158 ha) was established in 1998. One of the aspects taken into account in protecting this area was the overexploitation of the goose barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. Now, after five years of protection, differences in density, biomass, size and weight of the goose barnacle are investigated inside the protected area (Aketze and Gaztelugatxe locations) and outside of it, at the nearest locations (Izaro and Ogo√±o) which have been continuously exploited. This contribution demonstrates that the reserve could be an efficient tool in <b>preserving</b> the <b>goose</b> barnacle populations in the area. Hence, density, biomass and allometric coefficients are higher in the {{protected areas}}. These locations are also associated with higher percentages of juveniles, together with a high number of large-sized individuals...|$|R
5|$|Teeth {{belonging}} to the dusky shark are fairly well represented in the fossil record, though assigning Carcharhinus teeth to species can be problematic. Dusky shark teeth dating to the Miocene (23-5.3 Ma) have been recovered from the Kendeace and Grand Bay formations in Carriacou, the Grenadines, the Moghra Formation in Egypt, Polk County, Florida, and possibly Cerro La Cruz in northern Venezuela. Teeth dating to the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (11.6-3.6 Ma) are abundant in the Yorktown Formation and the Pungo River, North Carolina, and from the Chesapeake Bay region; these teeth differ slightly from the modern dusky shark, and have often been misidentified as {{belonging to}} the oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus). Dusky shark teeth have also been recovered from the vicinity of two baleen whales in North Carolina, one <b>preserved</b> in <b>Goose</b> Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (c. 3.5 Ma), {{and the other in}} mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (c. 12,000 years ago).|$|R
40|$|Native poultry breeds of East-European {{countries}} suffered considerable losses {{during the}} Second World War {{and as a}} result of the ''socialization'' of agriculture. Currently, steps are being taken to protect against extinction of all that remains. Most advanced in the programme of preservation of the native breeds of chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and other domestic and game birds are: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia & Ukraine. The authors are aware of the limited range of the presented material but a serious drawback has been the lack of information available from Albania, Bulgaria, Byelarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and former Yugoslavia. The studies carried out so far suggest that in the countries of Eastern Europe there is awareness of the necessity to maintain for future generations established native breeds of poultry not only as genetic resources indispensable for further breeding activities, but also as live evidence of the great achievements of many generations of past breeders. The present survey has allowed us to summarize information on 56 indigenous breeds, varieties and strains of chickens, 13 of turkeys, four of Japanese quail, three of guinea fowl, nine of ducks and 36 of <b>geese</b> <b>preserved</b> in East-European countries as poultry genetic resources. The most impressive poultry breed collection is in Russia, with 50 native breeds (24 of chickens, seven of turkeys, one of Japanese quail, three of guinea fowl, four of ducks and 11 of geese). Ukraine and Poland are also remarkable for the large poultry genetic resources numbering respectively 20 (eight of chickens, one of turkeys, four of ducks and seven of geese) and 18 (seven of chickens, two of Japanese quail and nine of geese) native breeds, varieties and strains...|$|R
