50|$|During the 1930s {{the plant}} was further developed, turning from raw iron {{production}} to steel production using open hearth furnaces; again Freyr, Brassert & Co. were chosen to supply the plant's design. A <b>pipe</b> <b>foundry</b> was opened in 1936, and in 1938 construction of a steel conversion plant using the Siemens-Martin (Open Hearth) process was begun. The first (60t capacity) open hearth furance opened 19 March 1939, additional furnaces were added during the 1940s and early 1950s, and {{the capacity of the}} furnaces increased - by 1956 the plant had six furnaces, each of 190t capacity. Construction of the plant's first rolling mill (Walserij West) was begun in the late 1930s. During occupation during World War II the mill was confiscated and shipped to Watenstedt (Salzgitter), Germany where it was installed in the Reichswerke Hermann Göring steel plant. Post-war the mill was returned to the Netherlands, and remained in operation until decommissioned in 1992.|$|E
50|$|McWane {{was born}} in Virginia, where his father {{operated}} a foundry business.

In 1908, McWane joined John Eagan's ACIPCO as a senior executive. He became the firm's president in 1915, and was responsible for much of its modernization and expansion until he was forced out by Eagan in 1921. Afterwards, McWane opened his own <b>pipe</b> <b>foundry</b> in Birmingham. It was the Roaring Twenties, and it quickly became successful, adding a second facility in Utah in 1926. McWane moved to a stately home in Mountain Brook in 1929. He also became a trustee of Lynchburg College in Virginia. While on business in Chicago, he died from a heart attack, in 1933.|$|E
