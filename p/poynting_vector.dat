40|$|International audienceWe present new {{results on}} wave <b>vectors</b> and <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> of chorus {{rising and falling}} tones {{on the basis of}} 6 years of THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) observations. The {{majority}} of wave vectors is closely aligned with the direction of the ambient magnetic field (B 0). Oblique wave vectors are confined to the magnetic meridional plane, pointing away from Earth. <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> are found to be almost parallel to B 0. We show, for the first time, that slightly oblique <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> are directed away from Earth for rising tones and toward Earth for falling tones. For the majority of lower band chorus elements, the mutual orientation between <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> and wave vectors can be explained by whistler mode dispersion in a homogeneous collisionless cold plasma. Upper band chorus seems to require inclusion of collisional processes or taking into account azimuthal anisotropies in the propagation medium. The latitudinal extension of the equatorial source region can be limited to ± 6 o around the B 0 minimum or approximately ± 5000 km along magnetic field lines. We find increasing Poynting flux and focusing of <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> on the B 0 direction with increasing latitude. Also, wave vectors become most often more field aligned. A smaller group of chorus generated with very oblique wave normals tends to stay close to the whistler mode resonance cone. This suggests that close to the equatorial source region (within  20 o latitude), a wave guidance mechanism is relevant, for example, in ducts of depleted or enhanced plasma density...|$|R

25|$|This {{solution}} includes {{near field}} terms {{which are very}} strong near the source but which are not radiated. As seen in the accompanying animation, the E and H fields {{very close to the}} source are almost 90° out of phase, thus contributing very little to the <b>Poynting</b> <b>vector</b> by which radiated flux is computed. The near field solution for an antenna element (from the integral using this formula over the length of that element) is the field {{that can be used to}} compute the mutual impedance between it and another nearby element.|$|E
25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the <b>Poynting</b> <b>vector)</b> is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E

Center wavelength and full width at half maximum of the spectrum are assumed to be 280 and 10 nm, respectively. The dipole source is polarized in the direction either parallel to the MQW plane for the excitation of the TE mode or perpendicular to the MQW plane for the excitation of the TM mode. In the computational domain shown in Figure  1, the dipole source for the TE and TM modes is set to be polarized in the x and z directions, respectively. The propagating light is completely absorbed without reflection in the PML. The <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> are calculated on the surfaces near PMLs and used to determine LEE of LED structures. LEE is defined as the fraction of emitted power out of the LED structure to the total emitted power, which is determined by the ratio of <b>Poynting</b> <b>vectors</b> integrated over extraction surfaces to total integrated Poynting vectors[18].

2500|$|The {{previous}} process excites {{more and}} more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein’s law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx, [...] where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium. [...] I is the modulus of <b>Poynting</b> <b>vector</b> of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in polar auroras).|$|E
2500|$|The law of {{conservation}} of momentum is usually taken {{to imply that}} any engine which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship (changing orientation, on the other hand, is possible).

[...] Field propulsion methods which do not rely on reaction mass thus must try {{to take advantage of}} this fact by coupling to a momentum-bearing field such as an EM wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft.

The fact that electrical energy could by transmitted {{at a distance}} without wires was actually observed by many inventors and experimenters, but lack of a coherent theory attributed these phenomena vaguely to electromagnetic induction. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell's equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the [...] "wireless" [...] carrier of electromagnetic energy. Around 1884 John Henry Poynting defined the <b>Poynting</b> <b>vector</b> and gave Poynting's theorem, which describe the flow of power across an area within electromagnetic radiation and allow for a correct analysis of wireless power transfer systems.

2500|$|The {{different}} angles of refraction {{for the two}} polarization components are shown in the figure {{at the top of}} the page, with the optic axis along the surface (and perpendicular to the plane of incidence), so that the angle of refraction is different for the p polarization (the [...] "ordinary ray" [...] in this case, having its polarization perpendicular to the optic axis) and the s polarization (the [...] "extraordinary ray" [...] with a polarization component along the optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case the electric polarization of the birefringent material is not exactly in the direction of the wave's electric field for the extraordinary ray. The direction of power flow (given by the <b>Poynting</b> <b>vector)</b> for this inhomogenous wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave vector resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the extraordinary ray may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its optic axis, placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.|$|E
