40|$|Effectiveness of the Dutch licence <b>on</b> <b>probation.</b> A simple {{demerit point}} system {{is used in}} the Netherlands during the first five years after having {{obtained}} the driving licence. This licence <b>on</b> <b>probation</b> (the Dutch 'beginner's licence') was introduced on 30 March 2002. In this report it has been investigated whether, after introduction, the number of severe crashes among young drivers (many of whom have a licence <b>on</b> <b>probation)</b> has seen a larger decrease than the number of crashes among a group of somewhat older drivers (of whom only a small percentage has a licence <b>on</b> <b>probation).</b> The number of severe crashes per 1. 000 driving licence holders did not decrease more for the younger group than for the group of somewhat older drivers. This indicates that it is improbable that the licence <b>on</b> <b>probation,</b> as it has been applied, has had a positive effect on the novice driver's involvement in crashes...|$|R
