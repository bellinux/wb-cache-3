5|$|More than 50% of the film's {{lifetime}} collections {{were from}} the Nizam region. The film also did well in the overseas box office. It was released in New Jersey with three <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> three screens and collected a record share of more than 150,000 dollars, turning the highest amount raised overseas by a Telugu film; the previous record holder was Trivikram Srinivas' Jalsa (2008), which collected more than 100,000 dollars. It grossed 102,000 dollars in its first two days in New Jersey and a share of 95,000 dollars in Virginia with two prints as of mid August 2009. It collected a share of 78,000 dollars in the San Francisco Bay Area with a single print. It managed to sell 2300 tickets in Minneapolis; the previous record for tickets sold there for a Telugu film was 1200. The film's overseas records were beaten two years later by Dookudu (2011), although disputes have arisen over which film holds the Tollywood all-time sales record.|$|E
5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E

25|$|We must {{be careful}} here, because it is quite {{possible}} that an algorithm will (temporarily) leave blanks in between figures, then come back and fill something in.

25|$|In {{subsequent}} years, Wain's cats {{began to}} walk upright, smile broadly and use other exaggerated facial expressions, and would wear sophisticated, contemporary clothing.

Such anthropomorphic portrayals of animals were very popular in Victorian England and were often found in <b>prints,</b> <b>on</b> greeting cards and in satirical illustrations such as those of John Tenniel.|$|E
25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} his wet plate collodion process.

There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> albumen or salted paper.|$|E

25|$|The prints proved quite popular, and at {{some point}} the {{lithograph}} was redrawn and a larger run printed; in some of the later versions the figures were numbered. William Buckland kept a supply of the <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> hand and circulated them at his geology lectures. Copies were soon sent to geologists outside Britain, including Cuvier in France. In Berlin, Leopold von Buch, presented the lithograph on 4 February 1831 to an audience, praised the then recent developments in British Geology and raised new questions about the processes of geohistorical change.|$|E

Another Galway-based newspaper is the Galway Advertiser, a free paper printed every Thursday {{with an average of}} 160 pages and a circulation of 70,000 copies.

25|$|The Fire Bulge and Breakthrough were {{released}} together in 2,202 <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> 7 May 1970 (including more than 200 prints in 70mm), {{two days before}} the 25th anniversary of Victory Day. Richard Stites reported that the Communist Party instructed all its members to purchase tickets. 56.1 million people watched the first, of which 56 million returned after the intermission for the second. Those figures were lower than expected, as popular pictures about the war which did not enjoy such promotion had much larger audiences. Yet still, The Fire Bulge/Breakthrough reached the first place at the Soviet box office for 1970. Together, they are also the 31st and the 32nd highest-grossing Soviet films ever.|$|E
25|$|The motif did not {{disappear}} in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as {{the range of}} religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of Daniel Hopfer and others make frequent use of the hand {{in a variety of}} contexts, and the personal emblem of John Calvin was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> the Dutch Revolt for example. In a high Rococo setting at the Windberg Abbey, Lower Bavaria, the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp.|$|E

25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered suggestions about posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap the shutter. White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of printing techniques and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum bichromate <b>prints.</b> <b>On</b> a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the Autochrome color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one Autochrome during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E

He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's <b>prints</b> <b>on</b> the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E
