30|$|PDT {{has emerged}} as an {{alternative}} and promising noninvasive treatment for cancer [17]. PDT utilizes the fact that certain compounds coined as photosensitizers, when exposed to light of a specific wavelength, are capable of generating cytotoxic ROS such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide to kill cancer cells [18, 19]. TiO 2, ZnO, and other semiconductor nanomaterials are regarded as the potential photosensitizing agents among the photosensitizers for PDT, due to their unique phototoxic effect upon the irradiation. They {{have been used in}} the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas as well as cancers of the head, neck, lung, esophagus, and bladder [20]. Compared to other photosensitizers, TiO 2 Ws which we prepared are bio-safe and non-cytotoxic, leading to <b>priority</b> <b>application</b> in clinical chemotherapy.

40|$|Abstract. Future Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{satellite}} {{networks are}} envisioned as distributed architectures of autonomous data processing nodes. Such ad hoc networks should deliver reliable communication channels for control commands and data among ground stations and satellites minimizing delay and power. The LEO satellite networks {{are different from}} the generic ad hoc scenario. In this paper, we first analyze the specifics of ad hoc LEO satellite networks. Next, we propose a cross-layer protocol architecture that includes three cross-layer optimizations: simple integrated MAC/PHY layer, novel Balanced Predictable Routing (BPR) and a dedicated QoS aware TCP sliding window control mechanism. They all contribute to the end-to-end delays improvement and successful delivery increase. It also fulfills the QoS requirements. According to our simulations, the coverage of ground stations is improved. The throughput percentage of all data types is improved by 5. 8 % on average and the QoS of high <b>priority</b> <b>application</b> is guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} methodological {{approaches to}} statistical patent analyses. The references to timescales, countries of origin, and patent offices largely determine {{the outcome of}} such analyses; in particular, for country comparisons. For instance, considerable differences appear if results are compared based on <b>priority,</b> <b>application,</b> or grant years. For interpreting the patent figures at specific offices it proves important to consider the geostrategic position of the office. Advanced approaches such as the triad concept lead to more balanced results, but their assessment has to include a consideration of international patent flows. For quality indicators {{it has to be}} taken into account that patents are always two-dimensional and have technical and economic aspects. In principle early quality indicators primarily cover the technological content. A further issue is the definition of samples aiming at a large number of suitable documents which is sometimes contradictory to the target of completeness...|$|E
40|$|Patent filings {{worldwide}} {{have been}} subject to a combined growth {{in terms of the number}} of applications filed and their size. This is putting patent systems under tremendous pressure, as witnessed by the evolution of backlogs at several patent offices. The present article presents an analysis of the evolution in patent voluminosity observed at the European Patent Office (EPO) over the past two decades. The results demonstrate that the average size of applications has doubled during this period and that the largest influence comes from applications filed via the PCT route and/or with a US <b>priority</b> <b>application.</b> Voluminosity indicators are clearly influenced by geographical origins and technological areas. The increasing voluminosity has a significant impact on EPO workload and processing efficiency. There is therefore a justified need for regulatory action. Evidence from recent changes in US patent fee policy is shown to have a significant knock-off effect on voluminosity indicators. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{technological}} activities of Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies and to compare them with the technological activities of other world regions. Using data from the EPO World Wide Statistical Database for the period 1980 - 2009 the analysis is based on counts of <b>priority</b> patent <b>applications</b> over time. In terms of <b>priority</b> patent <b>applications,</b> CEE reduced its technological activities drastically in absolute and per capita terms after 1990. The level of <b>priority</b> patent <b>applications</b> in this world region maintained more recently a stable level below the performance of EU 15, South EU and the former USSR.

However, these applications differ {{a lot in}} terms of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We propose a combination of three different QoS mechanisms over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network elements, in order to manage efficiently the scarce frequency spectrum. The first mechanism is a Call Admission Control (CAC) where connections are admitted only if the network is capable of providing the required resources. The second is a Radio Resource Reservation mechanism that ensures bandwidth to ongoing high <b>priority</b> <b>applications.</b> Finally, a scheduling mechanism provides a more regular behaviour to services. 1...|$|R
