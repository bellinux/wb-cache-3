In this context, various alkyne <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters</b> and phosphorylated epoxy monomers are developed via novel synthetic routes. To evaluate the FR potential of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters</b> bound to a polymer backbone, a selected polymeric FR is integrated via extrusion/molding and stirring into various polymer systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements on}} the absolute viscosity (eta) and density (rho) of trisubstituted <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters</b> which {{are useful in}} understanding their now mechanism necessary for accessing their role as plasticizers. The effect of chain length and branching has been examined on the eta and rho trends. From eta data, by using the Vogel-Tammann-Fulchur (VTF) equation, the VTF temperature (T-o) has been obtained which also represents the ideal glass transition temperature. T-o {{is related to the}} flexibility of the molecules. It is observed that T-o initially decreases with molecular weight, reaches ii minimum, and increases thereafter. The initial decrease in T-o has been attributed to the enhanced flexibility of the phosphate esters. Reversal of flexibility with relative molar mass beyond 400 is due to the gentle collision of the arms of the trisubstituted <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters.</b> This has been further corroborated from the molar mass exponent as exhibited in the eta-molar mass plot. The isomeric effect on eta has also been investigated in tricresyl phosphates, hitherto for the first time. The ortho isomer has highest eta among the isomers.

In this study, we demonstrated that (1) EPPase is found in the cytosol of yolk cells, (2) ecdysteroid-phosphates are localized in yolk granules, being bound to the yolk protein vitellin (Vn), and (3) Vn-bound ecdysteroid-phosphates are scarcely hydrolyzed by EPPase, although free ecdysteroid-phosphates are completely hydrolyzed by EPPase. Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which ecdysteroid-phosphates dissociate from the Vn-ecdysteroid-phosphate complex, and indicated that the acidification of yolk granules causes the dissociation of ecdysteroid-phosphates from the Vn-ecdysteroid-phosphate complex and thereby ecdysteroid-phosphates are released from yolk granules into the cytosol. Indeed, the presence of vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase in the membrane fraction of yolk granules was also verified by Western blot analysis. Our experiments revealed that Vn functions as a reservoir of maternal ovarian ecdysteroid-phosphates as well as a nutritional source during embryonic development. This is the first report showing the biochemical mechanism by which maternal Vn-bound ecdysteroid-phosphates function during early embryonic development. rights:社団法人日本動物学...|$|E

A broad variety of enzymatic reactions {{is associated with the}} consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), including, in particular, phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by kinases, formation of adenosine cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylate cyclases, and ATP decomposition by ATPase. We have studied the effect of a series of adenosine (ATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP) and guanosine (GTP, GDP) <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters,</b> and of pyrophosphate (PP) on the fluorescence emission of the europium tetracycline (EuTC) complex. We found that these compounds have strongly different quenching effects on the luminescence emission of EuTC. The triphosphates ATP and GTP behave as strong quenchers in reducing the fluorescence intensity of EuTC to 25 [*]% of its initial value by formation of a ternary 1 : 1 : 1 complex. All other phosphate esters showed a weak quenching effect only. The applicability of this fluorescent probe to the {{determination of}} the activity of phosphorylation enzymes is demonstrated by means of creatine kinase as a model for non-membrane-bound kinases.

Eadie-Hofstee analysis revealed that hexokinase kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) for [14 C]glucose phosphoric ester formation were similar in lean- and fa/fa-rat islets. For glucokinase, {{there was no difference in}} Vmax. between phenotypes. A non-significant tendency to increased sensitivity to glucose was noted in the fa/fa-rat islets (P = 0. 13). In lean-rat islets, the glucokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose (3 mM) decreased Vmax. by 80 % and increased the apparent Km from 3. 3 +/- 0. 7 mM to 12. 2 +/- 2. 0 mM (P < 0. 05). There was no difference in Km or Vmax. in mannoheptulose-treated versus control islets from fa/fa rats.

40|$|The intragastric {{administration}} of ethanol to fed rats caused in their liver, within about 1 h, a 20 -fold {{decrease in the}} concentration of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate, an activation of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphatase, an inactivation of phosphofructo- 2 -kinase but {{no change in the}} concentration of cyclic AMP.

There was also a relatively slow activation of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphatase and inactivation of phosphofructo- 2 -kinase. Glycerol and acetaldehyde had effects similar to those of ethanol on the concentration of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>esters</b> in the isolated liver cells. 4 -Methylpyrazole cancelled the effect of ethanol but reinforced those of acetaldehyde. High concentrations of glucose or of dihydroxyacetone caused an increase in the concentration of hexose 6 -phosphates and counteracted the effect of ethanol to decrease the concentration of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate. As a rule, hexose 6 -phosphates had a positive effect and sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate had a negative effect on the concentration of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate in the liver, so that, at a given concentration of hexose 6 -phosphates, there was an inverse relationship between the concentration of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate and that of sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate. These effects could be explained by the ability of sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate to inhibit phosphofructo- 2 -kinase and to counteract the inhibition of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphatase by fructose 6 -phosphate. sn-Glycerol 3 -phosphate had also the property to accelerate the inactivation of phosphofructo- 2 -kinase by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase whereas fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate had the opposite effect.

In the catalytic ozonation, TMP and phosphate were two major P-containing byproducts resulting from OMT degradation.

For instance, osteoporosis patients are observed to have elevated PAP serum levels. Furthermore, research has shown that transgenic mice that over-expressed the PAP gene developed mild osteoporosis. These observations therefore make human PAP an attractive target to develop anti-osteoporotic drugs. This project employed the strategy of using a substrate analogue, where the lead compound (as shown below) with Ki value of 8 µM against pig PAP was chosen as the basis in this rational drug design. Therefore acyl derivatives of α-aminoarylmethylphosphonic acids (as shown below) were designed as potential new potent PAP inhibitors. Docking studies suggested that the derivatives would have high binding affinity due to the phosphonate moiety (substrate mimic) binding to the binuclear metal centre, which are as intended. Furthermore, the long acyl chains make favourable interactions with the long hydrophobic groove adjacent to the dimetal centre, and depending on the size and substitutions on the aromatic ring, the ring might occupy the space in any of the small pockets {{in the vicinity of the}} active site; all of which contribute to the predicted high binding affinities of the derivatives to the enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Glyco-, phospho-, nucleo- and lipoproteins {{play key}} roles in {{biological}} signalling cascades, by which chemical signals are passed across the cell membrane and {{further to the}} cell nucleus. For {{the study of the}} biological phenomena associated with these protein conjugates, structurally well-defined peptides containing the characteristic linkage region of the peptide backbone with the carbohydrate, the Lipid or the <b>phosphoric</b> acid <b>ester</b> can be applied advantageously. The multifunctionality and the pronounced acid- and base-lability of lipo-, phospho-, nucleo- and glycopeptides, however, renders their synthesis a formidable challenge to conventional or ganic synthesis. This review highlights the potential of enzymatic transformations, in particular for the removal of protecting groups, as central techniques for the construction of complex and sensitive biologically relevant peptide conjugates under particularly mild conditions and with high selectivity...|$|R
