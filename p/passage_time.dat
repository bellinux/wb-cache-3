500|$|Although {{the canal}} was {{originally}} {{designed to be a}} narrow canal with narrow locks for boats [...] wide, in 1794 an agreement was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal company to create a link near Red Moss near Horwich, so broad locks were built to accommodate the [...] wide boats using that canal. [...] This meant removing some of the narrow locks that had already been built. [...] An extension to the original canal feeder was built at Weddell Brook in Bury, alongside the River Irwell. The route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was changed, however, and the planned link never materialised. [...] The design changes to the canal were not completely without merit, since they allowed two narrowboats to use each lock simultaneously, saving <b>passage</b> <b>time</b> and water.|$|E
500|$|The bullet time {{mode that}} Max Payne {{was known for}} was improved; the {{developers}} {{referred to it as}} [...] "version 2.0". The mode, which allows Max to move in slow motion to react and kill enemies more easily, was enhanced to give Max a refill of a portion of the Bullet Time gauge, as well as slowing down the <b>passage</b> <b>time</b> even further, as Max moves further [...] "into the zone" [...] with each consecutive kill. This was done to encourage players to aggressively dive head-on into dangerous situations rather than crouching at a safe distance and waiting for enemies to come to them. A new reload animation was also introduced, which, when Max reloads while in Bullet Time, allows him to duck to avoid bullets, spin around to survey the combat situation, and briefly pause to give the player a moment to think of a strategy. Development tools were made available for Max Payne 2 by Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment to allow players to create modifications for the game. Modifications can perform several functions, such as the ability to add new weapons, skills, perspectives, surroundings, and characters.|$|E

Ladder <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> {{are defined}} {{from the point}} fish last leave the transition pool until their last record {{at the top of}} the ladder at the exit to the forebay. Ladder <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> ranged between 2 to 4 hours for most fish (Figures 1 - 3). Median and mean <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> during 2003 were similar to those observed in previous years (Peery, 2003). We found a higher degree of variability in steelhead <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> in the north ladder at John Day Dam (coefficient of variation CV = 459) as there were several steelhead with longer travel times (10 - 700 hrs). Less variability was observed in other ladders (CV ranged from 58 at The Dalles north ladder to 167 at McNary north ladder) Variability in ladder <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> at all fish ladders were less for spring, summer, and fall Chinook salmon. Ladder <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> formed a binomial distribution with the deviation from normality being greater for those fish with longer <b>passage</b> <b>times</b> (Figures 4 - 6).

A man who has not seen a friend for a generation, keeps him in mind always as he saw him last, and is somehow surprised, and is also shocked, to see the aging change the years have wrought when he sees him again.
