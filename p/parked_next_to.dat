5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, {{known as}} When the Whistle Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who {{died during the}} {{previous}} year. The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is <b>parked</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the speaker's stage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, <b>parked</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
25|$|At 18:10 local time, Pukanić {{approached}} his Lexus LS 600h L with Niko Franjić, the Nacional director of marketing. According to first news report, a bomb {{placed in the}} trash can next to the car exploded soon after. However, an October 25 special edition of Večernji list dedicated to the bombing put the bomb on a motorcycle <b>parked</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Lexus which then exploded before {{the two men had}} a chance to enter the car. Pukanić was instantly killed by the blast while Franjić remained alive for a few more seconds. Two graphic design students from a nearby school were injured by shrapnel. The incident happened on a parking lot in Palmotićeva Street, near Stara Vlaška Street and Josip Lang Square, only two street blocks east of the main Zagreb square, Ban Jelačić Square. Police immediately blocked the traffic around the site of assassination, causing immense traffic jams all over the city center. A man was seen running away from the explosion down Palmotićeva Street. He was described as being in his early thirties, wearing a baseball cap and running with no regard for traffic.|$|E

500|$|During a dentist's {{appointment}} on October 6, 1977, Greene {{notices a}} car being <b>parked</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> his but makes {{nothing of it}} because the man who left the car was unknown to him. Returning to his car, Greene is stopped {{a small group of}} young boys riding bikes. In a gesture of admiration to the spunkiest of them, he gives the boy a necklace with a meaningful history to him. He notices Ferritto driving by slowly, and accepts that he is about to die, [...] Ferritto detonates a bomb on the car next to Greene's, killing Greene instantly. An epilogue, by Manditski, reveals that the investigation of Danny Greene's murder led to the collapse of the Mafia, not only in Cleveland, but all over the United States.|$|E
2500|$|After {{beginning}} with the cold-front passage at 3:10 pm on January 28 at Watertown, the blizzard's winds peaked at [...] at 7:00 pm. That night, about 150people were stranded at the Chesebrough-Pond factory in Watertown. Three radio announcers at radio station 1410 AM WOTT in Watertown were stranded without food, {{and each of them}} worked 8-hour shifts to keep the station on 24hours per day, playing music and taking hundreds of calls from North Country residents in need of services, such as fuel, food or reassurance. Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies brought the announcers provisions via snowmobile on the fifth day of their entrapment. Oddly enough, though the snow was piled up over the roof of the studios on Gifford Road, the morning announcer's VW Bug <b>parked</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the building was totally clear of snow, thanks to prevailing winds. It took him over 5hours to travel the [...] to his home in Brownville, as only one lane was clear on several of the roads he traveled.|$|E
