Since PVC conduit has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than other types, it must be mounted to allow for expansion and contraction of each run.

40|$|Clouds and {{aerosols}} {{impact on}} climate, both independently and through their interaction with one another. Thus, in climate models, {{it is important}} to make cloud schemes and in-cloud chemistry as realistic as possible. To this end, the UQAM sub-grid scale cloud scheme was added to LCM 11, a one-dimensional version of the Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model (NARCM). The goal of this project is to assess whether it is necessary to complete parameterization of sub-grid scale processes in LCM 11 by implementing sub-grid scale parcel chemistry. <b>Parallel</b> <b>runs</b> of LCM 11 with and without parcel chemistry were performed under various chemical scenarios. The production of sulphate, the main anthropogenic constituent of tropospheric aerosols, was compared within <b>parallel</b> <b>runs.</b> Sulphate production was not significantly changed by the implementation of parcel chemistry. Thus, for the scenarios assayed in this project, the addition of sub-grid scale parcel chemistry to LCM 11 is deemed unnecessary...|$|R

50|$|By 1910 the two {{stations}} were joined together, the three platforms at Princes Bridge. One was {{an extension of}} Flinders Street platform 1 (number 1 east) while {{the other two were}} an island platform with tracks numbered 15 and 16. Track 15 was a dead end, but track 16 (the northern-most track) had a traverser between it and a <b>parallel</b> <b>run</b> around siding to allow steam locomotives to change ends. A footbridge provided pedestrian access to the east end of the island platform, with the 'Flinders Street D' signal box located beyond it. Further north-east of the main lines to Jolimont was a locomotive siding and a coal stage, and carriage siding were located to the south-east. By 1957 the sidings had been rationalised, with the locomotive facilities and traverser removed. The sidings now formed part of Jolimont Yard.|$|E
