40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a research project}} with the aim to develop concepts and tools for architectural design, taking the ideas of "behaviour settings" as a starting point, to enable a more relevant holistic view in object oriented design of buildings. In this paper we introduce the concept of "architectural object" as a representation of a real "situation" involving people, behaviour, experience and environment, based on our idea that architectural design results in "situations" similar to but not identical to "behaviour settings". The purpose is to define a selection of possible configurable architectural objects that reflect the variability of situations possible to achieve using an industrialised building system. As architectural objects they shall {{be able to manage}} comprehensive information to be used in process tools for building design, production and facilities management. This paper presents a theoretical foundation for the use of architectural objects in a BIM environment. It also presents an analysis of the object structure that is applied to configure building projects in a company with off site <b>production</b> of <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> and proposes how these objects could be developed into architectural objects. The conclusion of the case study is that the company architects' view of the <b>volume</b> <b>elements</b> and their constituent design modules implicitly includes a conceptual model of user activities and phenomenal properties of the built environment. By fomalising these concepts and making them explicit as part of the architectural object, the related information can be accessible to all parties in the processes, design, production and facilities management. The information can be used for gaining experience of the building in use, for simulation, as input to brief development, and other analyses of interest. In an industrialized building process including <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> architectural objects could be developed during the product development phase and applied during building project design as configurable design units. Future research will investigate further possible application of the idea of architectural objects, specifically to support the architectural design process in industrialized house-building...|$|R
