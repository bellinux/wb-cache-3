5000|$|Honda {{drastically}} {{altered the}} head castings, tightening the valve angle from the 38degrees of the RC30 to 26degrees in the RC45. By reducing the valve angle, they straightened the port, along with making it higher, thus reducing the turbulence generating ‘short turn’ of the cylinder head. Honda {{also made the}} intake ports shorter and utilised intake valves that were 2 mm larger in diameter. The exhaust ports were also modified with a higher <b>port</b> <b>roof,</b> which reduced flow restrictions. The exhaust valves were also larger than the RC30’s in diameter ...|$|E

It is fitted with two gun <b>ports</b> on the <b>roof.</b> The optional armament mounted on the vehicle includes 7.62mm and 12.7mm machine guns, a 25mm anti-aircraft gun and a 40mm automatic grenade launcher.|$|R
50|$|The eight ton GVM M26-15 has a {{sustained}} road speed of 80 km/h, double lane change capability of 70 km/h, gradient of 60% and a side slope capability {{of more than}} 25°. Wide windows ensure a good situational awareness while twelve shooting <b>ports</b> plus two <b>roof</b> hatches and a 360° cupola with a pintle mount for a light machine gun ensures quick and furious retaliation from the crew {{in case of an}} ambush.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the hull}} and the {{superstructure}} {{are made of}} steel and aluminum. The propulsion plant consists of two Caterpillar diesel engines, with a total power of 5060 kW (over 5520 bhp), and controllable-pitch propellers producing a speed of over 17 knots. A hydraulically operated system of shell <b>ports,</b> doors, flaps, <b>roofs,</b> bath platforms, gangways and cranes provide the most possible ease of operation and comfort. The anchors, launches, life rafts and navigation lanterns are hidden behind covers and do not disturb the aesthetics of the yacht.|$|R
50|$|Power and {{telephone}} lines were down in <b>Port</b> Hedland, many <b>roofs</b> and fences were torn down and trees were uprooted. At least one house was destroyed. The Pilbara region was declared a disaster zone, and the Australian Defence Force was on standby to provide extra help. At around 10 p.m on 8 March, the Bureau of Meteorology's Port Hedland weather radar was {{damaged by the}} cyclone and was offline for nearly a day. Tropical Cyclone Jacob struck almost the same area as George only three days later, {{although it was not}} as damaging or deadly as George. It did however cause some minor flooding.|$|R

His Mech Tech weaponry {{consists of}} a lance and a shield that transforms into a bladed blaster. The figure also features light and sound effects; {{some of which are}} triggered when his Mech Tech weapon or those from other figures are placed on the <b>ports</b> on the <b>roof</b> in vehicle mode. In robot mode, his eyes light up and he says, [...] "I am Sentinel Prime!" [...] when his chest is pressed downward. Also says [...] "What has happened to the AllSpark?" [...] and [...] "Good to see you alive, Optimus".|$|R
5000|$|Canadian {{legal expert}} Michael Spratt wrote, [...] "... there’s no {{question}} that Canadian police sometimes look more like post-apocalyptic military mercenaries than protectors of the peace. Our police services have been acquiring more and more military toys — a dangerous trend that’s gotten {{little in the way}} of critical analysis in the mainstream media." [...] Growing numbers of Canadian police agencies have acquired armored vehicles in recent years. In 2010 the Ottawa Police Service bought a Lenco G3 BearCat armored personnel carrier for $340,000, which has [...] "half-inch-thick military steel armoured bodywork, [...]50 caliber-rated ballistic glass, blast-resistant floors, custom-designed gun <b>ports</b> and... a <b>roof</b> turret."The G20 protests in Toronto in 2010 showed that the militarization of protest policing is not only occurring in the United States. Police in Toronto used a sound cannon, or Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) -- a weapon that was developed for use in conflicts in the Middle East, as well as barricades, pre-emptive arrests and riot units. According to Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, [...] "the more interesting aspect of the militarization of the police is actually on the strategy side"; police are [...] "increasingly training with military-style tacticians, especially when it comes to situations like crowd control and, increasingly, surveillance." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{affecting}} both Fiji and Wallis and Futuna, Fran posed a {{major threat}} to parts of Vanuatu, as it became the fourth of five tropical cyclones to affect the island nation during the 1991-92 season. Ahead of the system impacting the island nation between March 8-10, schools were closed and several evacuation centres were opened, while communication equipment was secured and the National Disaster Management office broadcast hourly warnings. During March 9 the system passed about 15 mi to the north of Erromango and about 50 mi to the south of the island of Efate as a category 5 severe tropical cyclone. Erromango was estimated to have experienced hurricane-force winds of 130 km/h, while storm force winds of 56 km/h and wind gusts of 146 km/h were experienced at Bauerfield on Efate. On the island of Efate damage was widespread but variable, with places that were exposed to the south and west worst hit, including the village of Pango located just outside <b>Port</b> Vila. The <b>roofs</b> of 130 homes were destroyed and as a result suffered water damage, including on the Parliamentary complex of buildings. Port Vila was without electricity and fresh water supply for several days, while there was major damage reported to several buildings. Roads were blocked and On Erromango considerable damage to crops was reported while several homes were damaged. It was thought by the Vanuatu Meteorological Service that if Fran had passed about 20 mi to the north, then the situation {{would have been a lot}} worse.|$|R
