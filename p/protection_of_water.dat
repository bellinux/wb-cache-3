25|$|According to the Vietnamese Legislation, {{the entire}} {{population}} owns the water resources and single users and organizations are legally allowed to use {{them in order to}} meet their daily life and production. Apart from that, they are obligated {{to take care of a}} responsible water use and are supposed to protect all water resources. Nevertheless, the management of water resources is uniformly organized by the state. The legal framework concerning the management of water resources in general and the irrigation framework in particular is quite complicated in structure. Mainly, there are two documents providing rules and regulations for the use of water resources for irrigation. These are the Law on Water Resources (from the year 1998) and the Law on Land (replaced 1993). Especially for irrigation, there is the ordinance for the Exploitation and Protection of Irrigation Works and there are different secondary regulations concerning water use and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> resources. Besides, Vietnam has approved of and ratified different international conventions. The most important ones are the Ramsar convention (1989), the International Convention on Biodiversity (1993), the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin (1195), the Basel Convention (1995), the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2002), the UN Framework on Climate Change (2002), the Kyoto Protocol on the Clean Development Mechanism (2002).|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 a new, {{comprehensive}} Water Law (Loi 10-95) was passed.

It foresees measures to promote water use efficiency, better allocation of water resources and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> quality {{through the application of}} the user pays principle and the Polluter pays principle. The law also provided the legal basis for the establishment of river basin agencies for integrated water resources management, inspired by examples of such agencies in France and Spain, among other countries. In 1996 the Oum Er-Rbia agency was established as the first basin agency in Morocco. In 2000 agencies in the country's other six major basins were created. However, the basin agencies took many years and they still remain relatively weak entities. More than a decade after having been passed the law it is still not fully implemented.|$|E
