40|$|The Paper {{presents}} a constitutive model for describing the stress-strain behaviour of partially saturated soils. The model is formulated {{within the framework}} of hardening plasticity using two imdependent sets of stress variables: the excess of total stress over air pressure and the suction. The model is able to represent, in a consistent and unified manner, many of the fundamental features of the behaviour of partially saturated soils which had been treated separately by previously proposed models. On reaching saturation, the model becomes a conventional critical state model. Because experimental evidence is still limited, the model has been kept as simple as possible in order to provide a basic framework from which extensions are possible. Tbe mode 1 is intended for partially saturated soils which are slightly or moderately expansive. After formulating the model for isotropic and biaxial stress states, typical predictions are described and compared, in a qualitative way, with characteristic trends of the behaviour of partially saturated soils. Afterwards, the results of a number of suction-controlled laboratory tests on compacted kaolin and a sandy clay are used to evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce, quantitatively, observed behaviour. The agreement between observed and computed results is considered satisfactory and confirms the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproducing</b> the most important features of partially saturated soil behaviour using a simple general framework.

40|$|AbstractFor sure, {{to carry}} out a debate on the whatness of art is an attempt that should be affirmed. However, to discuss the whatness of art just through the {{concepts}} may end up with the ignorance of the most important element for creation of art, human being and its social and artistic position. For this reason, what should be done is to answer the whatness of art through analyzing the people in the field of art. As it is known, in modern differentiated societies, entrance to the field of art is usually performed through the processes of formal education. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} discuss on the social resources of the dominant art definitions by focusing on those that appear most likely to have the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproducing,</b> transforming or refusing the existing approaches to art. To achieve this goal, semi-structured interviews were made with 20 first class students who have just started their education and 20 fourth class students who will graduate in 2011 - 2012 academic year from Dicle University, Department of Fine Arts Training. As a result of these interviews, it was established that the university students’ relationship with the art is very limited before and during their university education, their knowledge is insufficient and in accordance with this, they seem to agree on a definition of art which enables them to enter the field of art...|$|R

40|$|The unknown, be it what {{exists in}} the deepest ocean trench or in the {{farthest}} outreach of space, has always served as food for the imagination of mankind. The discovery that human life could be successfully sustained in space opened mankind’s eyes to the infinite possibilities that were uncovered, but also raised a plethora of questions concerning the hazards linked to space travel and possible settlement of planets other than Earth. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} to determine the risks associated with space travel and to develop countermeasures against them. However, much remains to be discovered before long-term space missions are considered a feasible option. In this thesis, we considered two stressful conditions found in space that are radiation and microgravity, and we developed and used various models of space simulation. To that end, either acute or chronic irradiations were applied respectively before or during microgravity simulation on endothelial cells and on fibroblasts. These models were used to address two concerns of the European Space Agency (ESA), which are related to the cardiovascular risks associated with spaceflight and to the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> vertebrates <b>reproducing</b> in space...|$|R
40|$|Dynamical {{downscaling}} with high-resolution regional {{climate models}} may offer the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> realistically <b>reproducing</b> precipitation and weather events in climate simulations. As resolutions fall to order kilometers, {{the use of}} explicit rather than parametrized convection may offer even greater fidelity. However, these increased model resolutions both allow and require increasingly complex diagnostics for evaluating model fidelity. In this study we use a suite of dynamically downscaled simulations of the summertime U. S. (WRF driven by NCEP) with systematic variations in parameters and treatment of convection as a test case for evaluation of model precipitation. In particular, we use a novel rainstorm identification and tracking algorithm that allocates essentially all rainfall to individual precipitation events (Chang et al. 2016). This approach allows multiple insights, including that, at least in these runs, model wet bias is driven by excessive areal extent of precipitating events. Biases are time-dependent, producing excessive diurnal cycle amplitude. We show that this effect is produced not by new production of events but by excessive enlargement of long-lived precipitation events during daytime, {{and that in the}} domain average, precipitation biases appear best represented as additive offsets. Of all model configurations evaluated, convection-permitting simulations most consistently reduced biases in precipitation event characteristics...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAutomatically {{computing}} a cinematographic consistent {{sequence of}} shots over {{a set of}} actions occurring in a 3 D world is a complex task which requires not only the computation of appropriate shots (viewpoints) and appropriate transitions between shots (cuts), but the ability to encode and <b>reproduce</b> elements <b>of</b> cinematographic style. Models proposed in the literature, generally based on finite state machine or idiom-based representations, provide limited functionalities to build sequences of shots. These approaches are not designed in mind to easily learn elements of cinematographic style, nor do they allow to perform significant variations in style over the same sequence of actions. In this paper, we propose a model for automated cinematography that can compute significant variations in terms of cinematographic style, {{with the ability to}} control the duration of shots and the possibility to add specific constraints to the desired sequence. The model is parameterized in a way that facilitates the application of learning techniques.

50|$|Throughout colony development, the foundress {{remains the}} highest-ranked member. Workers rarely display {{dominance}} behaviors to the foundress. The dominance hierarchy in Polistes japonicus is determined not by body size but by worker age, similarly to the related species Polistes instabilis. Depending {{on the development}} of the colony, either young workers or older workers are higher in the dominance hierarchy. In the first-brood period of these wasps, older workers are more likely to be ranked higher in the dominance hierarchy, but the opposite is true in the mixed brood period. The dominance hierarchy promotes efficient foraging during the first-brood period and in the mixed brood period it functions to determine which workers might have a chance to produce offspring of their own. In moving up the dominance hierarchy, it is more common for the younger workers to do this because they are less physically and physiologically damaged as a result of working for a shorter period of time. Young workers could also seem more successful as a result of the older workers being uninterested due to their age and the unlikely <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> them <b>reproducing.</b> Rank is important in this species because this social dominance hierarchy functions as a mechanism to select who will supersede the foundress and be able to reproduce.|$|R
