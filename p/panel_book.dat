50|$|The {{introduction}} to the <b>panel's</b> <b>book</b> also states that Bacque ignored that Eisenhower himself was the one warning his superiors about food shortages as early as February 1945—months before the war had even ended—then again in May when Eisenhower requested food imports from the United States. Tent stated that Bacque also misleadingly cited only part of a June 1945 war report that 630,000 tons of imported wheat would meet the minimum German civilians minimum food requirements, leaving the reader thinking that the food shortage could easily be solved by United States shipments, without informing the reader of an accompanying report that the Allies brought in 600,000 tons of grain, {{and that it was}} quickly used up.|$|R
5000|$|The New Orleans <b>panel's</b> <b>book</b> {{introduction}} concluded [...] "that Bacque {{is wrong}} {{on nearly every}} major and nearly all his minor charges seem to us to be overwhelmingly obvious. To sum up: Eisenhower was not a Hitler, he did not run death camps, German prisoners did not die by the hundreds of thousands, there was indeed a severe world food shortage in 1945, there was nothing sinister or secret about DEF designation or about the Other Losses column. Bacque's [...] "Missing Million" [...] were old and young boys in the militia dismissed early from the American camps; they were escapees from camps and POWs/DEFs transferred from camp to camp in Germany and Europe for various reasons." ...|$|R

40|$|Displaying scanned book {{pages in}} a web browser is difficult, due to an array of {{characteristics}} of the common user’s configuration that compound to yield text that is degraded and illegibly small. For books which contain only text, this can often be solved by using OCR or manual transcription to extract and present the text alone, or by magnifying the page and presenting it in a scrolling <b>panel.</b> <b>Books</b> with rich illustrations, especially children’s picture books, present a greater challenge because their enjoyment is dependent on reading the text {{in the context of}} the full page with its illustrations. We have created two novel prototypes for solving this problem by magnifying just the text, without magnifying the entire page. We present the results of a user study of these techniques. Users found our prototypes to be more effective than the dominant interface type for reading this kind of material and, in some cases, even preferable to the physical book itself...|$|R
