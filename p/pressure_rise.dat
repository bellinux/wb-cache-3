5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
25|$|The {{idealized}} compressive dynamic turbo-machine {{achieves a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> by adding kinetic energy/velocity to a continuous flow of fluid through the rotor or impeller. This kinetic energy is then converted {{to an increase}} in potential energy/static pressure by slowing the flow through a diffuser. The <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> in impeller is in most cases almost equal to the rise in the diffuser section.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} axial direction, the {{centrifugal}} component in the energy equation does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the energy equation is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into <b>pressure</b> <b>rise.</b> Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> per stage which constitutes a stator and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> in a stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E

40|$|In the past, an {{increase}} of beam intensity in RHIC has caused several decades of <b>pressure</b> <b>rises</b> in the warm sections during operation. This {{has been a major}} factor limiting the RHIC luminosity. About 430 meters of NEG coated beam pipes have been installed in the warm sections to ameliorate this problem. Beam ion induced desorption is one possible cause of <b>pressure</b> <b>rises.</b> A series beam studies in RHIC has been dedicated to estimate the desorption rate of various beam pipes (regular and NEG coated) at various warm sections. Correctors were used to generate local beam losses and consequently local <b>pressure</b> <b>rises.</b> The experimental results are presented and analyzed in this paper...|$|R

Observations during the latest runs show beam induced electron multipacting {{as one of the}} causes for these <b>pressure</b> <b>rises.</b> Experimen-tal studies are carried out at RHIC using devoted instru-mentation to understand the mechanism leading to electron clouds. In the following, we report the experimental elec-tron cloud data and the analyzed results using computer simulation codes...|$|R
25|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> {{results in}} a {{stagnation}} temperature rise. For a given geometry the temperature rise depends on {{the square of the}} tangential Mach number of the rotor row. Current turbofan engines have fans that operate at Mach 1.7 or more, and require significant containment and noise suppression structures to reduce blade loss damage and noise.|$|E
25|$|Axial flow {{compressors}} {{produce a}} continuous flow of compressed gas, {{and have the}} benefits of high efficiency and large mass flow rate, particularly {{in relation to their}} size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a large <b>pressure</b> <b>rise,</b> making them complex and expensive relative to other designs (e.g. centrifugal compressors).|$|E
25|$|To {{weigh the}} {{advantages}} between centrifugal compressors {{it is important}} to compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.|$|E

The dependence of the <b>pressure</b> <b>rises</b> on various beam characteristics such {{as the number of}} protons per bunch, the number of bunches per batch and the shape of the vacuum chambers as well as the electron current collected by a pick-up will be discussed. The results of the observed clean up i. e. "beam scrubbing" will be presented as well as the consequences of the electron cloud phenomenon on the SPS operation with the LHC nominal beam intensity. Finally, a clear effect of the bunch spacing and of the missing bunches in the batch on the <b>pressure</b> <b>rises</b> and on the pick-up signals has been observed and will be discussed...|$|R
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are often}} used in small gas turbine engines like APUs (auxiliary power units) and smaller aircraft gas turbines. A significant {{reason for this is}} that with current technology, the equivalent flow axial compressor will be less efficient due primarily to a combination of rotor and variable stator tip-clearance losses. Further, they offer the advantages of simplicity of manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer stages to achieve the same <b>pressure</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
25|$|For either event, {{cavitation}} {{occurs on}} the upstream side of valve. Clinically, cavitation is of primary {{concern in the}} mitral position. This position is especially harsh due to the sudden ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> which drives the valve closure against a low left atrial pressure which {{is said to be}} the worst case condition thus position for cavitation to occur. Cavitation is also suspected as a contributing factor in blood cell damage and increased risk of thromboembolic complications.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earliest}} period, gunpowder has been {{composed of a}} nitrate salt, sulfur, and carbonaceous matter. The Nitrate component is the Oxidizing agent, Sulfur is a low melting Reducing agent and serves {{to aid in the}} transfer of heat through the gunpowder mass, and Carbon is a reducing component producing hot, high pressure gas. The utility of gunpowder lies in its ability to accelerate a projectile by the explosive expansion of gas. The development of new explosive materials in the 19th century naturally led to improvements in the rate and magnitude of <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> as well as new means for ignition of the charge.|$|E
25|$|Low {{pressure}} operation. Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores {{are designed to}} operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the containment building cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very high boiling points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful pressure increase. There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a large <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Ricardo was {{studying}} the phenomena affecting the combustion within the petrol engine and the diesel engine. He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased flame speed, {{and that he}} could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> and good fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> and efficiency.|$|E

500|$|The {{magnitude}} of Patricia's rapid intensification {{is among the}} fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h). This represents a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). This fell {{just short of the}} world-record intensification set by Typhoon Forrest in 1983, which featured a pressure drop of 100mbar (hPa; 2.95inHg) in just under 24hours. With a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg), Patricia is the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. The previous record was 941mbar (hPa; 27.73inHg) set by Hurricane Odile in 2014.
