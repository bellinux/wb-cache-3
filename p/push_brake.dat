40|$|The {{limitations}} of current simulation packages {{in addressing the}} true longitudinal behaviour of railway bogie dynamics during braking/traction has prompted {{the development of a}} Rail Bogie Dynamics (RBD) program in this thesis. The RBD program offers novel features for the calculation of the speed profile {{as a function of the}} brake torque as well as explicitly determining wheelset angular velocity. With such capability, the speed profile is no longer treated as an input calculated as a priori as required by most of the current simulation systems. The RBD program has been developed using a formulation that includes the wheelset pitch degree of freedom explicitly with a coordinate reference system that is fixed in space and time. The formulation has made the simulation of the bogie dynamics during braking/traction possible in a natural way using the brake/traction torque as the input and the resulting speed profile as the output without any need for working out the speed profile as a priori. Consequently, severe dynamics during braking such as the wheelset skid and the onset of wheel climb derailment can be modelled and critical parameters investigated using the RBD program. The RBD program has been validated, where possible, through a series of simulations using a commercial software package (VAMPIRE). For cases which cannot be simulated by VAMPIRE such as the wheelset skid, a novel experimental program has been designed and commissioned in the Heavy Testing Laboratory of the Central Queensland University as reported in this thesis. One of the possible applications of the RBD program in examining the effect of asymmetric brake shoe force in bogies equipped with one-side <b>push</b> <b>brake</b> shoe arrangement is illustrated in this thesis. It is believed that the model and RBD program will have significant benefit in understanding the true longitudinal behaviour of wagons in suburban passenger trains that operate under braking/ traction torques for most of their travel. Similar studies will also be useful to freight train wagon dynamics during entry and exit of speed restriction zones and tight curves. " [...] abstract...|$|E

50|$|Power brakes are {{a system}} of {{hydraulics}} used to slow down or stop most motor vehicles. It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal {{is connected to the}} vacuum booster which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder which compresses a liquid and forces it through the brake lines to the brakes themselves. The liquid that is <b>pushed</b> into the <b>brakes</b> activates the brake calipers which in the case of disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>push</b> against the <b>brake</b> rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels.

50|$|When {{the brakes}} are applied, brake fluid is forced under {{pressure}} from the master cylinder into the wheel cylinder, which in turn <b>pushes</b> the <b>brake</b> shoes into contact with the machined surface {{on the inside of the}} drum.

50|$|Rim brakes {{are also}} often {{enhanced}} by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe shaped plates which are bolted between the brake pistons (Or {{arms in the}} case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the tyre. This increases the force needed to <b>push</b> the <b>brakes</b> apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever and in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes this has a second benefit which is to protect the brake line which loops over the tyre between the brake pistons from being accidentally hit and broken.|$|R

50|$|Another type {{of power}} brake {{installed}} in automobiles {{is called the}} drum brake. This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel.

When the driver <b>pushes</b> the <b>brake</b> pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the drum of the brake to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel.

50|$|The {{vacuum booster}} {{was invented in}} 1927 {{in order to provide}} a shorter {{stopping}} distance. Vacuum boosters provide brake assist for the driver by multiplying the force out of the booster creating more than the force that was used to <b>push</b> on the <b>brake</b> pedal. The booster works by pulling the air out of the booster chamber with a pump creating a low pressure system inside. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the input rod on the booster is pushed in which lets atmospheric pressure into the booster. This, in turn, pushes the diaphragm toward the master cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Currently, {{vehicles}} are often equipped with {{active safety systems}} {{to reduce the risk}} of accidents, many of which occur in the urban environments. The most popular include Antilock Braking Systems (ABS), Traction Control and Stability Control. All these systems employ different types of sensors to constantly monitor the conditions of the vehicle, and respond in an emergency situation. In this paper the use of ultrasonic sensors in safety systems for controlling the speed of a vehicle is proposed. An intelligent mechatronic system includes an ultrasonic wave emitter provided on the front portion of a car producing and emitting ultrasonic waves frontward in a predetermined distance. An ultrasonic receiver is also placed on the front portion of the car operatively receiving a reflective ultrasonic wave signal. The reflected wave (detected pulse) gives the distance between the obstacle and the vehicle. Then a microcontroller is used to control the speed of the vehicle based on the detection pulse information to <b>push</b> the <b>brake</b> pedal and apply brake to the car stupendously for safety purpose...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{wheelchair}} handrim is a {{key factor}} in the wheelchair ergonomics and has been shown to affect both user's comfort and propulsion efficiency. Since the handrim is used for both <b>pushing</b> and <b>braking,</b> friction is an important aspect influencing thermal comfort on hands. This study was aimed at investigating the influence of handrim design on hands’ temperature during manual wheelchair propulsion. Ten able-bodied subjects performed an “ 8 -shaped” propulsion protocol on a flat floor, repeated twice, each time with a different pair of handrims: the standard round metallic tube handrims, and the ergonomically designed handrims. Temperature on hands’ surface was measured with a thermographic camera at three moments: before starting the protocol and immediately after each protocol with a different handrim. The results show that the average maximum temperature on hands’ surface after propelling the wheelchair with the conventional handrims (36. 77 + 1. 66 oC) was significantly higher (p= 0. 01) than after propelling with the ergonomic handrim (36. 22 + 1. 33 oC). Measuring the temperature on hands with a thermographic camera was shown to be a useful technique to investigate thermal aspects of the hand-operated devices...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they <b>push</b> the <b>brake</b> pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|R
2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc <b>pushes</b> the inner <b>brake</b> pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|R
