As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} data on physician {{malpractice insurance}} premiums and state tort law to analyze how <b>physicians</b> <b>in</b> various medical specialties are differentially affected by caps on noneconomic damages. As higher premiums {{put pressure on}} legislators to enact damage caps, I instrument caps on noneconomic damages with enactment of tort reform measures that do not affect malpractice premiums to uncover the effect of caps on noneconomic damages on such premiums. I find evidence to support that, in terms of dollars saved, <b>physicians</b> <b>in</b> high risk specialties benefit more from noneconomic damage caps than <b>physicians</b> <b>in</b> low risk specialties. However, in percentage terms, I find that <b>physicians</b> <b>in</b> all specialties essentially benefit equally from caps on noneconomic damages...|$|R

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Australian Army's director general of medical services, Major General Rupert Downes tapped Fairley as consulting physician.

He joined the AIF Headquarters in Cairo in September, taking advantage of the initial quiet period to familiarise himself with the AIF's medical units and their commanders. As the British Army in the Middle East had no consulting <b>physician</b> <b>in</b> tropical diseases, Fairley accepted an offer to act in this capacity as well.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (1859–1930) was a Scottish {{writer and}} <b>physician.</b> <b>In</b> {{addition}} to the series of stories chronicling the activities of Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr John Watson {{for which he is}} well-known, Doyle wrote {{on a wide range of}} topics, both fictional and non-fictional. In 1876 Doyle entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School, where he became a pupil of Joseph Bell, whose deductive processes impressed his pupil so much that the teacher became the chief model for Holmes. Doyle began writing while still a student, and in October 1879 he had his first work—"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley"—published in Chambers's Journal. He continued writing short works—both fictional and non-fictional—throughout his career, and had over 200 stories and articles published.|$|E

Kajaani was severely affected by famine in 1867-1868 which devastated much of Finland, but the town gradually recovered {{and by the end of}} the century had grown to more than 1200 inhabitants. Kajaani Town Hall was built in 1831, the former City Library in 1852, Kainuu's first elementary school in 1883, and Kajaani Church in 1896 as it grew into a notable settlement.|$|E

5|$|No {{attempt to}} arrest Blackburn was made, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with his family in}} early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known <b>physician</b> <b>in</b> Louisville. Thousands {{died as a result of}} failing to heed Blackburn's advice to boil potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.|$|E
5|$|The signatories had {{all been}} active in Lithuania's {{independence}} movement. Antanas Smetona, Donatas Malinauskas, and several others had participated in secret Lithuanian fellowships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These groups were involved in promoting the illegal distribution of Lithuanian-language publications using the Latin alphabet, which was banned by the Tsarist government from 1866 to 1904, as well as fighting other attempts at Russification by the authorities. Antanas Smetona, Steponas Kairys, Alfonsas Petrulis, and Mykolas Biržiška were expelled from their secondary schools for these activities. Jonas Basanavičius, the future chairman of the Council of Lithuania when the Act was signed, worked as a <b>physician</b> <b>in</b> Bulgaria and furthered the cause of public health there. Despite the demands of his medical work abroad, he contributed continuously to Lithuanian affairs. He organized {{the publication of a}} major underground newspaper, Aušra; its first issue appeared in 1883. Basanavičius was active in Bulgaria's political life as well, representing its Democratic party. Many of the signatories had participated in the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius, which shaped the political future of the Lithuanian state.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British <b>physician,</b> <b>in</b> Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E
