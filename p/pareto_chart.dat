5000|$|Identify how {{the process}} inputs (Xs) affect the process outputs (Ys). Data are {{analyzed}} to understand the magnitude of contribution of each root cause, X, to the project metric, Y. Statistical tests using p-values accompanied by Histograms, <b>Pareto</b> <b>charts,</b> and line plots are often used to do this.|$|R
5000|$|Bar charts have a {{discrete}} range. Bar charts are usually scaled {{so that all}} the data can fit on the chart. Bars on the chart may be arranged in any order. Bar charts arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called <b>Pareto</b> <b>charts.</b> Normally, bars showing frequency will be arranged in chronological (time) sequence.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> is {{a special}} type of histogram, used to view causes of a problem in order of {{severity}} from largest to smallest. It is a statistical tool that graphically demonstrates the Pareto principle or the 80-20 rule.|$|E
50|$|When the {{observation}} period has concluded, the assessor should generate a <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> from the resulting data. This chart then determines {{the order in}} which the process is to be investigated and sources of variation that lead to defects removed.|$|E

For instance, Kaoru Ishikawa defined the flowchart {{as one of the}} seven basic tools of quality control, next to the histogram, <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart,</b> check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, and the scatter diagram. Similarly, in UML, a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the activity diagram, which is a type of flowchart, {{is just one of many}} different diagram types.|$|E

50|$|Continuous {{improvement}} (CI) {{is motivated}} and tracked using value stream performance boards. Typically these visual boards are updated weekly and used by the value stream CI team to identify improvement areas, initiate PDCA projects, and monitor their progress. These boards show the value stream performance measurements, <b>pareto</b> <b>charts</b> (or other root cause analysis), and information about the CI projects. The boards also show the current and future state maps together with the project plan to move from current to future state. The Value Stream Performance Boards become “mission control” for both break-through improvement and continuous improvement of the value stream.|$|R

50|$|The control charts: a {{statistical}} {{approach to the}} study of manufacturing process variation for the purpose of improving the economic effectiveness of the process. These methods are based on continuous monitoring of process variation. The control chart, also known as the ''''Shewhart chart' or 'process-behavior chart'''' is {{a statistical}} tool intended to assess the nature of variation in a process and to facilitate forecasting and management. A control chart is a more specific kind of a run chart. The control chart is one of the seven basic tools of quality control which include the histogram, <b>pareto</b> <b>chart,</b> check sheet, control chart, cause and effect diagram, flowchart and scatter diagram. Control charts prevents unnecessary process adjustments; provides information about process capability; provides diagnostic information and it is a proven technique for improving productivity.|$|E

As it is seen, for the fluids R 11, R 123, and R 141 B which are dry or isentropic fluids, the obtained range in <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> for their exergy is much lower than other fluids. It means that the optimization results for these three fluids in all the three methods show similar or close exergy efficiency, while for other fluids, {{it is not the}} same and the obtained range is significantly great. The results of the <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> of the fluid C 5 F 12 contain the points with lowest exergy efficiency. In Table  9 that shows {{the highest and}} lowest thermal efficiency of <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> for different fluids. Again, it is seen that the fluids R 11, R 123, and R 141 B have the lowest efficiency. This also indicates closeness of the thermal efficiency of these fluids according to the <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> results. Again, C 5 F 12 has the lowest thermal efficiency. In Table  10, the lowest and highest obtained costs in the <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> of the fluids optimization are shown. Again, the fluids R 11, R 123, and R 141 B cover a smaller range that indicates the closeness of the <b>Pareto</b> <b>chart</b> results for the three fluids.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the combined influence of process parameters (independent variables) such as homogenization speed (X 1), duration (X 2), and temperature (X 3) during the preparation of dacarbazine-loaded cubosomes. Box–Behnken design was used to rationalize the influence of these three factors on two responses, namely particle size (Y 1) and encapsulation efficiency (Y 2). Independent and dependent variables were analyzed with multiple regressions to establish a full-model second-order polynomial equation. F value was calculated to confirm the omission of insignificant parameters or interactions of parameters from the analysis to derive a reduced-model polynomial equation to predict the Y 1 and Y 2 of dacarbazine-loaded cubosomes. <b>Pareto</b> <b>charts</b> were also obtained to show the effects of X 1, X 2, and X 3 on Y 1 and Y 2. For Y 1, there was a model validated for more accurate prediction of response parameter by performing checkpoint analysis. The optimization process and <b>Pareto</b> <b>charts</b> were obtained automatically and they predicted the levels of independent parameters X 1, X 2, and X 3 (0. 889794, 0. 11886, and 0. 56201, respectively) and minimized Y 1. The optimal process parameters (homogenization’s speed[*]=[*]~ 24, 000  rpm, duration[*]=[*] 5. 5  min, and temperature[*]=[*] 76 °C) led to the production of cubosomes with 85. 6  nm in size and 16. 7 % in encapsulation efficiency. The Box–Behnken design proved to be a useful tool in the preparation and optimization of dacarbazine-loaded cubosomes. For encapsulation efficiency (Y 2), further studies are needed to enhance the result and improve the model for such water-soluble drug encapsulation in cubosomes...|$|R
