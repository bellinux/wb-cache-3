(1981) and the susceptibility of LDL isolated to in vitro oxidation by copper ions was evaluated according to the procedure described by Wallin et al. (1993). In brief, freshly sampled plasma (1000  µL) was taken in a centrifuge tube (thin-walled <b>polyallomer,</b> 13  ×  51  mm, Beckman Instruments), and the density was adjusted to 1.3  g/mL {{by the addition of}} solid 0.1140  g of potassium bromide (KBr) and 0.025  g of sucrose. Then the tube was gently over layered with 2  mL of a salt solution with a density of 1.1  g/mL [11.42  mg of sodium chloride (NaCl) and 75.98  mg of KBr/mL], which then was overlaid with 2  mL of distilled water to fill the tube. Centrifugation (Optima XL- 100  K, Beckman) was performed at 280, 000 g at 4  °C for 7  h. The LDL fraction was collected using a syringe by inserting the needle directly into the LDL band and applying gentle suction. The isolated LDLs were desalted by dialysis against 10  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150  mM NaCl at 4  °C. The protein content of the LDL was determined by the modified Lowry method (Markwell et al. 1978) with bovine serum albumin used as a standard.|$|E
40|$|Authors: Gustavo Tiscornia, Oded Singer and Inder M. Verma This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Lentiviral Vectors Expressing siRNA,” Chapter 3, in [*Gene Transfer: Delivery and Expression of DNA and RNA*]([URL] (eds. Friedmann and Rossi). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2007. ### INTRODUCTION This protocol combines the specificity of small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing cassettes with the versatility of lentiviral vectors to stably transduce {{a wide range of}} cell types. A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed against a given target is cloned into a plasmid containing the pol III promoter. The design uses a 5 ′ forward primer upstream of the pol III promoter and a 3 ′ reverse primer that includes the entire shRNA sequence (i. e., sense, loop, and antisense sequences followed by five Ts), followed by 22 bases complementary to the last 22 bp upstream of the + 1 transcriptional start site of the pol III promoter. An NheI-compatible restriction site is included at the 5 ′ end of both forward and reverse primers. A single round of PCR is used to amplify this template. The resulting DNA fragment contains an shRNA expression cassette that can be cloned into a simple cloning vector, tested, and then transferred to the lentiviral vector, or cloned into the lentiviral vector directly. This procedure uses a unique restriction site in the 3 ′ long terminal repeat (LTR). During integration, the 5 ′ LTR of the provirus is copied from the 3 ′ LTR, cloning the H 1 -driven shRNA into the 3 ′ LTR, resulting in duplication of the silencing cassette. This strategy maximizes the silencing power of the lentiviral vector. The combination of the lentiviral and siRNA technologies provides a powerful tool to achieve long-term down-regulation of specific target genes both in vitro and in vivo. ### RELATED INFORMATION Figure 1 presents a schematic representation of the protocol. One undesirable consequence of this procedure is that the siRNA target sequence is also present in the mRNA expressing the marker gene, resulting in somewhat lower expression of the marker. In an alternative method, [Design and Cloning of an shRNA into a Lentiviral Silencing Vector: Version B]([URL] (Tiscornia et al. 2008), the position of the silencing cassette is upstream of the marker expression cassette, thus avoiding down-regulation of the marker. Because the silencing cassette is not in the 3 ′ LTR, only one copy of the silencing cassette is delivered per viral particle. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. The siRNA expression cassette consists of a nucleotide sense sequence (identical to the target sequence in the mRNA to be down-regulated), followed by a 9 -bp loop, an antisense sequence, and a stretch of five Ts (T 5) as a pol III transcriptional termination signal downstream from an H 1 promoter. After PCR amplification, this is packaged into the NheI site of a transfer vector containing all the cis-acting elements required for replication and packaging of RNA into viral particles, including a Rev-responsive element (RRE) to enhance nuclear export of unspliced viral genomic RNA, woodchuck hepatitis virus regulatory element (WPRE) to enhance expression of the transgene, and a central polypurine tract (cPPT) purported to increase efficiency of nuclear import of the preintegration complex. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is used as a marker. A number of algorithms have been developed to predict effective siRNA sequences (e. g., [[URL] or [[URL] A database search is recommended to filter out candidate targets that are present in other genes to avoid silencing of these loci. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Centrifuge - Dishes (tissue-culture, 15 -cm) - Dishes (tissue-culture, six-well) - Filters (0. 22 - or 0. 45 -μm) - Incubators preset to 37 °C (3 % and 10 % CO 2) - Microcentrifuge - PCR machine - Rotors (SW 28 and SW 55) (Beckman) - Tubes (50 -mL) - Tubes (centrifuge, <b>polyallomer,</b> 5 -mL) (Beckman) - Tubes (centrifuge, <b>polyallomer,</b> 30 -mL) (Beckman) - Tubes (microcentrifuge) - Vortexer ### METHOD **Design and Cloning of shRNAs** 1. Select a target within the gene to be silenced and design primers to amplify the silencing cassette. For GFP, the target would be: GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTC (Tiscornia et al. 2003). The 3 ′ reverse primer would be: 5 ′ CTGTCTAGACAAAAAGCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCTCTCTTGAAGAACTTCAGGGTCAGCTTGCGGGGATCTGTGGTCTCATACA 3 ′, where the H 1 sequence is in italic bold, XbaI (NheI compatible) is underlined, and the loop is bold underlined. - Mix 10 ng of the pGEM-T plasmid containing the H 1 promoter (the template) and 10 μM (final concentration) each of the 5 ′ forward primer and the 3 ′ reverse primer, with the Advantage GC 2 polymerase mix, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Add 7 % (v/v) DMSO or a similar agent to a regular Taq polymerase reaction to prevent hairpin formation. - *Use the GC-melt additive as 10 X*. - Amplify using the parameters listed below: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") *This results in an amplified fragment of ~ 400 bp that can be cloned in an A/T vector for sequencing or directly cloned in the lentivector plasmid*. 4. Digest the insert with XbaI and gel-purify. 5. Digest the lentivector plasmid with NheI, gel-purify, and then dephosphorylate. 6. Validate the cloned shRNA cassettes by transfecting or transducing (as lentiviral particles) to a cell line that expresses the target gene. - *Typically, 50 ng of vector are ligated to 100 ng of insert and transformed into competent bacteria. Plasmid DNA from the resulting colonies can be screened by digestion with SspI. The parental vector should have only one SspI site, whereas the vector containing the insert will acquire an additional SspI site located in the H 1 promoter. It is important to verify the integrity of the hairpin by sequencing using the H 1 -F primer 5 ′-TGGCAGGAAGATGGCTGTGA- 3 ′, because mutations in the hairpin can significantly reduce the efficiency of down-regulation*. 7. Alternatively, coexpress a tagged cDNA of the target gene together with shRNA silencing cassettes in an easily transfected cell line (e. g., 293 T). - *This is useful when target mRNA is restricted to certain cell types or a specific antibody against the target is unavailable. Typically, transfect 200 ng of target cDNA plasmid plus 500 - 1000 ng of the plasmid containing the silencing cassette per well (six-well cluster) and harvest the cells for immunoblot analysis 48 - 72 h after transfection*. **Preparation of Lentiviral Vectors** 8. Twenty-four hours before transfection, prepare plates and cells: - i. To increase cell adherence, precoat twelve 15 -cm dishes with 10 mL of PBS containing 0. 001 % (w/v) poly-L-lysine. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Aspirate the liquid. - ii. Immediately seed the 293 T cells (from two 15 -cm plates of confluent cells) to the twelve 15 -cm plates in DMEM with 10 % FBS. - *Addition of 1 % antibiotic-antimycotic solution does not interfere with transfection*. - iii. Grow the cells overnight. - Make sure that the cells are 70 %- 80 % confluent and evenly distributed at the time of transfection to optimize viral titer. 9. Transfect the plasmid mix into the cells using the CaPO 4 precipitation method: - i. Aliquot the four plasmids into a 50 -mL tube. For each set of twelve 15 -cm dishes, use: - 270 μg of lentivector - 176 μg of pMDL (Gag-Pol) - 95 μg of pVSV-G - 68 μg of pREV - ii. Prepare 13. 5 mL of a 0. 25 M solution of CaCl 2 from a 10 X stock solution of CaCl 2. Add to the plasmid mix. - iii. Add 13. 5 mL of 2 X BBS to the mixture from Step 9. ii. Mix gently by inversion. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature. - iv. Add 2. 25 mL of the transfection mixture from Step 9. iii dropwise to each plate. Swirl the plates gently to distribute. Incubate in a 3 % CO 2 atmosphere overnight at 37 °C. 10. Approximately 16 - 20 h after transfection, remove the media. Add 15 mL of fresh DMEM with 2 % FBS to each plate. Incubate in a 10 % CO 2 atmosphere overnight at 37 °C. 11. Collect the supernatant from the plates. Filter through 0. 22 - or 0. 45 -μm filters. Add 15 mL of fresh medium to each plate and incubate overnight. - *Filtered supernatants can be stored for several days at 4 °C*. 12. Collect media from the plates and filter as in Step 11. 13. Pool collected supernatants from Steps 11 and 12. Transfer to 30 -mL centrifuge tubes, using 25 - 29 mL per tube. Concentrate the viral particles by centrifuging in an SW 28 rotor at 19, 400 rpm for 2 h at 20 °C. 14. Resuspend all pellets in a total of 1 mL of HBSS. Wash tubes a second time with 1 mL of HBSS. 15. Add HBSS to the resuspended pellets and tube washing fluid to a final total volume of 3 mL. 16. Prepare a 1. 5 -mL cushion of 20 % sucrose in HBSS in 5 -mL centrifuge tubes. Layer the resuspended pellets on the sucrose cushion. Centrifuge using an SW 55 rotor at 21, 000 rpm for 1. 5 h at 20 °C. 17. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of HBSS. Wash the tube with an additional 100 μL of HBSS. 18. Shake the resuspended viral preparation on a low-speed vortexer for 15 - 30 min. 19. Centrifuge for 10 sec to remove debris. Aliquot the cleared viral solution. - *The solution can be stored at - 80 °C for many months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles*. 20. Titrate the viral preparations by quantitating levels of the capsid protein p 24 using a p 24 ELISA kit (or by biological titration if an adequate marker is contained in the lentivector). - Titers normally range between 10 e 9 and 10 e 10 viral particles/mL but can be lower if transfection efficiency of packaging plasmids is suboptimal. ### REFERENCES 1.

This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (<b>polyallomer</b> centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (<b>polyallomer</b> centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.

Sullivan ### Abstract Ocean viruses are abundant, ubiquitous, {{and play}} {{important}} roles in global biogeochemical cycles through mortality, horizontal gene transfer and manipulation of host metabolism. However, the ability to link viruses to their hosts in a high-throughput manner bottlenecks our ability to understand virus-host interactions in complex communities. Here, we present viral tagging (VT), a method that combines mixtures of isotope labeled host cells and fluorescent viruses with flow cytometry. In a single experiment, we can screen 10 e 7 uncultivated ocean viruses with a single strain of Synechococcus. These viruses can then be sequenced to quantitatively link objectively defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts. ### Introduction As ocean ecology attempts to advance from observations to predictions, modeling becomes of fundamental importance. While two decades of viral ecology {{research has focused on}} community level understanding through measuring viral abundance, production, decay, and frequency of infected cells (reviewed by Ref 1), {{little is known about the}} fundamental question of “who infects whom?”. Cultivation-based methods can directly link a virus strain to its host; however, it is impossible to characterize millions of viruses per milliliter of seawater and thousands to 100 s of thousands of “viral types” per sampling site (2) using traditional low-throughput cultivation methods. For example, Fluorescently Labeled Viruses (FLVs) have been used as probes to “tag” their host cells for examination under the microscope (3 - 5), a method that is limited only by being low-throughput. Here, as illustrated in Fig 1, we expand upon the use of FLVs to tag host cells by (i) incorporating flow cytometry to enable high-throughput detection and sequencing of infected host cells, and (ii) isotope labeling host cells to minimize the bacterial DNA in the viral tagging metagenome. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. Overview for viral tagging (VT) ** - A. Environmental viruses are fluorescently-labeled green, then mixed with potential host bacteria which are labeled with heavy isotope, but flow cytometrically green-negative. - B. Flow cytometry data triggered on forward scatter for the fluorescently labeled virus and host bacteria co-incubated at desire VBR. Tagged cells infecting by viruses with extra fluorescence can be sorted out from non-infected cells. - C. DNA is extracted from the sorted, viral-tagged population. Isotopically light viral DNA is then separated from heavy host DNA using a density gradient for the downstream amplification and sequencing. ### Materials 1. 15 N ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. NLM- 467 - 1). - Quant-iT Pico Green (Invitrogen P 7589). - SYBR Gold (Invitrogen S 11494). - TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA). - MTN buffer (0. 6 M NaCl, 0. 1 M Tris-Cl pH 7. 5, 0. 1 M MgCl 2). - Bovine serum albumin (BSA). - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). - Fluorescent polystyrene FLOW Check™ microspheres (1 μm yellow-green beads; Polysciences Inc., PA, cat# 23517 - 10). ### Equipment 1. Ultracentrifuge, we used a Beckman L 70 ultracentrifuge with Beckman VTi 65 vertical rotor and 13 × 48 mm OptiSeal <b>polyallomer</b> tubes (4. 9 ml capacity). - Appliskan plate reader (Thermo Electron, Vantaa, Finland). - Sonication bath, we used VWR Signature Ultrasonic cleaner B 1500 A-DTH. - Refrigerated centrifuge, we used Eppendorf 5417 R. - Flow cytometer, we used iCyt Reflection flow cytometer (Sony Biotechnology) and a MoFlo™ XDP cytometer (Beckman Coulter). - Nanosep 10 K centrifugal tubes (Pall OD 010 C 33). ### Procedure **Isotopic Labeling of Cyanobacteria and DNA Analysis** 1. Prepare SNAX medium according to directions (6), but use 15 N ammonium chloride which will provide the heavy isotope. Grow cyanobacteria in the medium with heavy nitrogen and transfer at least 3 times before use. - Extract DNA from bacterial grown in heavy nitrogen using standard methods. - Quantify the DNA using Quant-iT Pico Green (Invitrogen #P 7589). - Use at least 10 µg of DNA for density gradient centrifugation. - For density gradient centrifugation, a Beckman VTi 65 vertical rotor was used with 13 × 48 mm OptiSeal <b>polyallomer</b> tubes (4. 9 ml capacity). - Mix the DNA with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7. 6) to a final volume of 0. 9 ml. - Mix the DNA with 4 ml of CsCl prepared in TE to a density of p 1. 8 (measure the density of the final solutions, they should be p 1. 7). - Dispense 4. 9 ml of the DNA sample in CsCl into the OptiSeal tube and plug with the black caps. - Centrifuge at 44, 000 rpm (= 184, 678. 5 g) in a Beckman L 70 or L 80 ultracentrifuge for 48 hr at 18 °C (Caution: do not centrifuge at lower temperatures as CsCl may precipitate out). - Collect 0. 2 - 0. 25 ml fractions and measure the density of each. - Calculate amount of DNA in each fraction using Quant-iT Pico Green (perform in dulicate) to determine the density of the fractions with DNA. Estimate the ratio of isotopic labeled cells. **Preparation of SYBR Gold working stock** 1. Thaw 10, 000 x stock of SYBR Gold in the dark and vortex vigorously. - Centrifuge for 10 min at 3000 x g. - Dilute 1 : 100 (to 100 x) with TE buffer and then filter through 0. 02 µm filter. - Aliquot into 50 or 100 µl amounts and store frozen at - 20 °C. **SYBR-Gold Staining of Virus** 1. Thaw prepared 100 X SYBR Gold the dark, one time only (do not refreeze). - Vortex thawed SYBR Gold vigorously before using to stain viruses. - If using CsCl-purified virus, dialyze in modified MTN buffer. - Stain the viruses by adding prepared SYBR Gold to the viral suspension to a final concentration of 5 x for a concentrated viral stock (equal to or greater than E+ 09) or 1 x for less concentrated viral stock (SYBR Gold will degrade upon exposure to light. The final volume should be 500 µl. - Prepare a blank without virus to assess how well the excess SYBR Gold is washed away. - Vortex the sample for 10 sec on high to mix the dye and viruses. - Incubate 10 min in the dark at room temperature. - Heat at appropriate temperature for 10 min, using foil to cover the heat block to keep the sample in the dark. The staining temperature will depend on the host-virus system used, the infectivity of stained viruses in various temperature should be pretested. - Cool down the sample in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Do not vortex the sample when it is still hot or you will disrupt the phage particles. **Wash Background Stain Away** 1. You will need one Nanosep 10 K centrifugal tube for each stained virus preparation plus one for the SYBR-Blank. - Prepare 0. 02 µm filtered 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA; equal to 10 mg/ml) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); this should be filtered fresh before viral washing. - Wash Nanosep 10 k tubes by adding 500 µl MTN buffer, let stand 10 min, then spin until almost dry (5, 000 x g, 10 min) and discard the flow-through. - Add 500 µl 0. 02 µm filtered 1 % BSA, let stand 1 hr at room temperature and spin until almost dry (5, 000 x g, 15 - 30 min); discard the flow-through. - Then wash with 500 µl 0. 02 µm filtered MTN buffer. - Concentrate the 500 µl stained and cooled virus preparations and the SYBR-Blank in the pre-treated Nanosep devices using 3, 000 x g for 15 - 30 min, at 10 °C to get to < 50 µl volume. - Wash the reduced volume of stained virus or SYBR-Blank with 500 µl 0. 02 µm filtered MTN buffer and repeat spin as in step # 6. - Repeat # 7 for a total of 6 washes being sure to bring volume to < 50 µl each time. - Transfer the 50 µl of washed viruses and SYBR-Blank from the Nanosep into fresh collection tubes (1. 5 ml centrifuge tubes) and keep the collection tubes on ice. - Add 50 µl 0. 02 µm filtered buffer to each Nanosep and sonicate for 3 min using the settings of 50 W at 42 kHz; then pipet up and down on the filter carefully so as not to puncture the membrane and add to the appropriate stained virus or blank tubes and transport the collection tubes of washed viruses on ice. **Virus Tagging** 1. Perform the tagging as soon as possible after staining and washing the virus. - Count the host cells and the SYBR-stained viruses to determine the amount of each to add. The virus-to-bacterium ratio (VBR) will depend on the host-virus system used, but in general will be 1 to 10. Incubate washed viruses with isotope labeled host cells for 60 minutes. - Prepare the flow cytometer for use and trigger on forward angle or side scatter. - Examine the 0. 02 µm filtered MTN buffer and set voltages so that noise is minimized. - Examine the host cells alone to set voltages to determine proper concentration to use and to determine where they are located on the plot of 520 nm vs scatter. Use fluorescent polystyrene FLOW Check™ microspheres (final concentration is 1 : 1 to host cells) as an internal standard for counting and sorting. - Mix the host cells with the SYBR-Blank, incubate dark for 10 min and mix the tube gently. Examine the mixture – the host cells should not increase in 520 nm fluorescence. - Mix the host cells with the stained and washed virus at the appropriate VBR and examine after appropriate incubation times. If the stained viruses attach to the host cells, then the cells will show an increase in fluorescence at 520 nm. - Sort and collect the viral-tagged cells, which are of increased fluorescence. - Sorted viral-tagged cells can be subjected to DNA extraction and separation of 15 N-labeled “heavy” host DNA from non-labeled “light” viral DNA by CsCl density ultracentrifugation. See “Cesium Chloride Virus Purification and Dialysis” protocol (7). - Light DNA can be linker amplified (8) for sequencing by 454 Roche Titanium and Illumina HiSeq 2000. Please note that our linker ligation step of the library prep strongly selects against ssDNA and further, RNA viruses would not be sequenced in a DNA metagenome. ### Timing The time required for isotope labeling of host cells is variable, for 3 inoculation of Synechococcus WH 7803 are about 3 - 4 weeks. The viral wash steps usually take about 3 hs. The sorting takes about 1 hour for E+ 08 cells, depending on the number collected and the experience of the investigator. Thus the whole procedure can be accomplished within 4 - 5 weeks. ### Troubleshooting 1. Increase in 520 nm fluorescence of the mixture of cells and the SYBR-Blank. The washing procedure for the viruses is probably not adequate. - No increase in 520 nm fluorescence of the mixture of cells and the strained and washed viruses. The washing procedure for the viruses might have failed and lost most of the viruses, count the number of viruses recovered from washing. Otherwise increase the VBR to add more viruses per cell. ### Anticipated Results Following the viral tagging method and DNA isolation and extraction, resulting DNA can be sequenced and used for viral community analysis (see Figure 1). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2.
