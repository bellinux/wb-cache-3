5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding <b>potential</b> <b>jurors.</b> The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5000|$|A {{peremptory}} challenge {{also allows}} attorneys to veto a <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> on a [...] "hunch".|$|R
5000|$|In England, these {{objections}} {{would have}} to be very well based, such as the defendant knowing a <b>potential</b> <b>juror,</b> to be allowed.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} struck one <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> who was black, a gun-owner who stated {{he watched}} Fox News. This particular prospective juror {{had been a}} defense favorite.|$|R
25|$|In March 2017, {{the defense}} {{asked the court}} to call up 2,000 people as <b>potential</b> <b>jurors.</b> They wished to mail the <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> a {{questionnaire}} so lawyers could winnow the field of <b>potential</b> <b>jurors.</b> The prosecution objected to Cosby's defense team's requests as to the amount of jurors to be questioned, {{the manner in which they}} were to be selected, and the timeframe for jury selection, saying that Cosby was trying to get special treatment.|$|E
25|$|Jury {{selection}} {{for the trial}} began on June 25, 2007, drawing {{from a pool of}} 102 <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> {{from as far away as}} Dillingham and Bethel. Several <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> were challenged because they had already made judgments about Anderson's guilt or innocence or for other reasons. One potential juror was excluded because she had researched Anderson on Wikipedia.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship exposure to forensic crime television has on a <b>potential</b> <b>juror’s</b> willingness {{to find a}} suspect guilty when presented with a case involving only circumstantial and eyewitness evidence. This study also looks at a <b>potential</b> <b>juror’s</b> expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial based upon this exposure. To better understand these relationships, the study utilized social constructionism as the theoretical framework. To collect data, an original survey instrument that included either a violent or non-violent crime scenario was developed. Reponses from 1572 undergraduate students were analyzed to better understand what might influence their willingness to find a suspect guilty and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial. The results indicate that viewership of forensic crime television does not significantly influence a <b>potential</b> <b>juror’s</b> decision to find a suspect guilty or not guilty. After controlling for viewership, {{it appears that the}} number of justice-based classes completed by the <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> does influence their decision to find the suspect guilty. The analysis also shows that gender and the type of scenario (violent versus non-violent) may influence a juror’s willingness to find a suspect guilty. It does not appear that there is a correlation between a juror’s willingness to find a suspect guilty and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial...|$|R
5000|$|A 2012 {{study from}} Duke University {{published}} in the Quarterly Journal of Economics investigated the effect of jury selection and racial composition on trial outcomes. The study found that black defendants (81%) are significantly more likely than whites (66%) to be convicted {{when there are no}} <b>potential</b> black <b>jurors</b> in the pool. Even with only one black member of the jury pool, conviction rates are almost identical (71% for blacks and 73% for whites). While 64% of cases had at least one black <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> in the pool, only 28% of all trials had one or more black members on the seated jury. [...] "Whenever attorneys use peremptory challenges to strike black members of the pool ... they forgo the possibility of excluding another <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> with a similar ex ante probability of convicting," [...] and the composition of the jury indirectly reflects that of the juror pool.|$|R
50|$|According to Section 13 and 21 of the Jury Ordinance, each <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> is {{assigned}} a number. The Registrar is then to print {{the number on}} separate cards of equal size and put into a box. Afterwards, in open court, the Registrar draws cards from the box until a jury is formed.|$|R

25|$|Voir dire for Shea's {{first trial}} {{stemming}} from the 1905 Chicago strike began on September 13, 1906. Selection of the jury took 66 days, and 3,920 <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> were interviewed before a jury could be seated.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{the judge}} {{dismissed}} several <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> and the prosecutor, Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury {{on the ground}} that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.|$|E
50|$|Uttecht v. Brown, , {{was a case}} {{dealing with}} jury {{selection}} in capital {{cases in which the}} Supreme Court of the United States held that appeals courts must defer to a trial judge’s decision on whether a <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> would be able to overcome demur about capital punishment and be open to voting to impose a death sentence.|$|R
50|$|Following a 2010 {{decision}} by the Arkansas Supreme Court regarding newly produced DNA evidence and <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> misconduct, the West Memphis Three negotiated a plea bargain with prosecutors. On August 19, 2011, they entered Alford pleas, which allowed them to assert their innocence while acknowledging that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict them. Judge David Laser accepted the pleas and sentenced the three to time served. They were released with 10-year suspended sentences, having served 18 years and 78 days in prison.|$|R
5000|$|The defense struck one <b>potential</b> <b>juror,</b> {{a female}} African American, as a [...] "stealth juror" [...] {{for failing to}} {{disclose}} that her pastor had advocated strongly on behalf of Trayvon Martin. The state attempted to strike one woman whose husband owns guns, and who said she may have difficulty sending someone to prison. They also attempted to strike a woman who asked why Martin was out at night. The judge denied the strikes and both women {{were part of the}} six person jury.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of trial, 12 jurors and 12 {{alternates}} were selected {{from a pool of}} 250 <b>potential</b> <b>jurors.</b> Over the course of the trial 10 were dismissed {{for a wide variety of}} reasons. Only four of the original jurors remained on the final panel.|$|E
25|$|Looking to {{influence}} <b>potential</b> <b>jurors,</b> Schultz presented {{himself to the}} town as a country squire and good citizen. He donated cash to local businesses, gave toys to sick children, and performed other charitable deeds, a strategy that proved successful. In the late summer of 1935, to everyone's surprise, Schultz was acquitted of tax evasion.|$|E
25|$|In a press {{appearance}} {{following a}} hearing in September 2016, Cosby's lawyers claimed {{for the first time}} that racial bias was to blame for the sex-assault charges against their client. Some prominent criminal defense lawyer commentators, such as Mark Geragos and Carl E. Douglas, stated that this assertion may be an effort to influence <b>potential</b> <b>jurors.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{counsel to}} Governor Bush, Gonzales helped advise Bush in {{connection}} with jury duty when he was called in a 1996 Travis County drunk driving case. The case led to controversy during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign because Bush's answers to the <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> questionnaire did not disclose Bush's own 1976 misdemeanor drunk driving conviction. Gonzales made no formal request for Bush to be excused from jury duty but raised a possible conflict of interest because as the Governor, Bush might {{be called upon to}} pardon the accused party. Gonzales' work in this case has been described as [...] "canny lawyering".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the jury}} {{selection}} process, after voir dire, opposing attorneys may request removal of any juror {{who does not}} appear capable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict, in either determining guilt or innocence and/or a suitable punishment. [...] An example would be a <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> in a murder case, where the sentencing options include {{the death penalty and}} a lesser sentence (such as life without parole), who states that s/he [...] "would sentence a defendant to death if found guilty"; such a statement may indicate the person's unwillingness to fairly consider a life without parole sentence.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{arguments}} on March 1, {{the issue of}} jury selection received the most attention. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor seemed especially bothered by the questioning of one <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> who reported that she had lost $50,000 to $60,000 in the Enron debacle. [...] "How can we be satisfied that a fair and impartial jury was picked when the judge doesn't follow up when the juror said, 'I'm a victim of this crime, Sotomayor asked. The government maintained that the judge and the selection process were appropriate. Sri Srinivasan, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, was Skilling's Washington defense attorney, and Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben argued for the government.|$|R
25|$|On June 28, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court (citing their June 3, 1968 {{decision}} in Witherspoon v. Illinois) upheld Speck's conviction but reversed his death sentence, because more than 250 <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> were unconstitutionally excluded from his jury {{because of their}} conscientious or religious beliefs against capital punishment. The case was remanded back to the Illinois Supreme Court for re-sentencing.|$|E
25|$|The Judiciary Law {{states that}} all litigants (who {{have the right}} to a jury trial) {{have the right to}} juries {{selected}} from a fair cross section of the community and that all eligible citizens shall have both the opportunity and the obligation to serve. <b>Potential</b> <b>jurors</b> are randomly selected from lists of registered voters, holders of a driver's licenses or ID issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles, New York state income tax filers, recipients of unemployment insurance or family assistance, and from volunteers. The grand jury is organized pursuant to article 190 of the Criminal Procedure Law.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 2007, {{hearings}} on pretrial motions began. <b>Potential</b> <b>jurors</b> {{were to be}} brought to court on August 29, 30, and September 4, to fill out questionnaires, but face-to-face questioning of prospective jurors was not planned to begin until September 19, 2007. Opening statements were expected to begin on October 29, 2007; however, they were postponed, and rescheduled for November 5, 2007. The defense stated that the delay was due to possible prejudicial information in a television segment about the case to be aired on November 2. The prosecutor stated the delay was necessary as more time was needed for additional pretrial motions.|$|E
40|$|The law {{relating}} to rape {{is currently the}} subject of much debate following the Home Office figures which state that the UK conviction rate is under 6 %, creating pressure on the Government to implement change. It is well-documented that pre-conceived attitudes about the nature of rape can be a huge barrier to prosecuting rape effectively. Each year the number of women reporting rape increases significantly but the conviction rate remains the same. This article examines the current role and practices of the police and CPS in prosecuting rape cases and considers the impact that rape myths and preconceived attitudes held by the public and <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> members can exert on the trial process...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{criminal}} trial taking place, Crown prosecutors and the defense also sought vast publication bans and sealing orders over the police evidence, preventing the media from reporting {{on the details of}} the case until the jury would hear it during the future trial. The media fought the application, but the judge eventually agreed to both a sealing order and publication ban, stating in his ruling that [...] "there is a real risk that pretrial publicity will undermine the accused's constitutionally protected right to a fair trial." [...] The jury pool was then polled through a [...] "challenge for cause" [...] procedure to determine if a <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> had been influenced by extensive media coverage prior to the publication bans taking effect.|$|R
25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports {{made it hard to}} find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> who refused to say {{whether or not they were}} living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E
25|$|James Kirkland Batson was an African American man {{convicted of}} {{burglary}} and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court {{by a jury}} composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal {{was based on the}} jury selection, or voir dire, phase of the trial. During this phase <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During voir dire the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.|$|E
25|$|March 23, 2007: Attorneys {{defending}} Addison {{planned to}} contest the use of capital punishment. They intended to explore controversial issues about the law and were expected {{to refer to a}} 1997 trial in which a man convicted of murdering a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In addition, the defense attorneys wanted a change of venue, to gain stricter security; and they wanted to prevent newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while he was in prison and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense said that such photographs could bias viewers against him and complicate his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial. On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request, saying that the trial would not affect jury selection and <b>potential</b> <b>jurors</b> had likely already seen published photos of Addison.|$|E
50|$|In a 5-4 conservative-liberal {{split the}} {{majority}} {{found that the}} 9th Circuit had indeed erred when they overruled the Washington State Court's decision and invalidated Brown's death sentence. The precedents of Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), and Darden v. Wainwright, 447 U.S. 168 (1986), established that a state trial judge may, without presenting any explicit findings or conclusions, remove a juror for cause when the judge determines the juror's views {{on the death penalty}} would substantially limit his or her ability to follow the law and perform the duties of a juror. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, said that appeals courts must defer to a trial judge’s decision on whether a <b>potential</b> <b>juror</b> would be able to overcome qualms regarding the death penalty and be open to voting to impose execution as a sentence.|$|R
50|$|A stealth juror or rogue juror is {{a person}} who, {{motivated}} by a hidden agenda in reference to a legal case, attempts to be seated on the jury and to influence the outcome. Legal scholars believe that lawyers can identify stealth jurors by {{paying close attention to}} non-verbal behavior connected with deception and identifying discrepancies between answers to oral voir dire and written questionnaires. A <b>potential</b> stealth <b>juror</b> may be hard to read and excessively reserved. The <b>potential</b> for stealth <b>jurors</b> to nullify death penalty statutes has prompted calls to eliminate the requirement of a unanimous verdict in jury trials. On the other hand, the argument has been raised that stealth jurors can serve as a defense against bad laws.|$|R
50|$|Another {{issue with}} jury trials is the <b>potential</b> for <b>jurors</b> to {{be swayed by}} prejudice, {{including}} racial considerations. An infamous case was the 1992 trial in the Rodney King case in California, in which white police officers were acquitted of excessive force in the violent beating {{of a black man}} by a jury consisting mostly of whites without any black jurors.|$|R
