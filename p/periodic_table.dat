5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> {{consisting}} of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E

The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted.

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his <b>Periodic</b> <b>Table</b> of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his <b>Periodic</b> <b>Table,</b> Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> At {{the bottom of}} the <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> (Mendeleev's 1871 <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> and Meyer's 1870 <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each horizontal <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higher—more recent—estimate is that the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines. Other predictions of an end to the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> include at element 128 by John Emsley, at element 137 by Richard Feynman, and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The rows of {{the table}} are called periods; the columns are called groups.

5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{protactinium}} {{is located}} in the <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower the}} values of {{ionization}} energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional <b>periodic</b> <b>tables</b> and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some <b>periodic</b> <b>tables,</b> {{and the practice of}} sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.|$|R
50|$|Dmitri Mendeleev {{claimed that}} he {{arranged}} his first <b>periodic</b> <b>tables</b> in order of atomic weight ("Atomgewicht").
