50|$|New {{ideas can}} come {{by way of}} experimenting with tools and methods. Some {{designers}} explore ideas using pencil and paper. Others use many different mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture {{as a means of}} inspiring creativity. Traditionally, objects like <b>pencil,</b> <b>compass,</b> ruler, drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers. One reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} pairs of shoes, one {{of which had been}} made in 1938 and the other in 1939. There was a mineral water bottle of a type {{supplied}} to hotels in Morecambe, Lancaster and Ingleton, and containing a blue 'crown' top not introduced until 1940. Other items found with the man included a wristlet watch, handkerchief, shaving tube, studs, toothbrush, fountain pen, propelling <b>pencil,</b> <b>compass,</b> box of matches, tablets, flashlamp, and toiletries. The man had a key but the police were unable to identify the lock which it opened.|$|E

5000|$|In the past, drafters sat at drawing {{boards and}} used <b>pencils,</b> pens, <b>compasses,</b> protractors, triangles, and other {{drafting}} devices {{to prepare a}} drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released {{and was able to}} produce technical drawings at a faster pace. Many modern drafters operate computer-assisted drafting equipment and software such as AutoCAD, Vectorworks, Revit, or Solidworks but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You remain here,' said I, to my comrades. 'If three {{horsemen}} pass you, {{stop them}} at any hazard. The lady will describe them to you. I {{will be with}} you presently.' One shake of the bridle, and I was flying into Fontainebleau as only Violette could have carried me. At the palace I flung myself off, rushed up the stairs, brushed aside the lackeys who would have stopped me, and pushed my way into the Emperor's own cabinet. He and Macdonald were busy with <b>pencil</b> and <b>compasses</b> over a chart. He looked up with an angry frown at my sudden entry, but his face changed colour when he saw that it was I.|$|R
6000|$|With {{the other}} {{subjects}} under the headings of A and B, {{it is not}} necessary to deal at any length here. Drawing begins at home, and a child should have begun to sketch freely before the formal schooling commences. It is the business of the school to teach drawing and not to teach [...] "art," [...] which, indeed, is always an individual and spontaneous thing, and it need only concern itself directly with those aspects of drawing that require direction. Of course, an hour set aside from the school time in which boys or girls may do whatever they please with paper, ink, pens, <b>pencils,</b> <b>compasses,</b> and water-colour would be a most excellent and profitable thing, but that scarcely counts (except in the Quack Schools) as teaching. As a matter of fact, teaching absolutely spoils all that sort of thing. A course in model drawing and in perspective, however, is really a training in seeing things, it demands rigorous instruction and it must be the backbone of school drawing, and, in addition, studies may be made from flowers that would not be made without direction: topography (and much else) may be learnt by copying good explicit maps; chronology (to supplement the child's private reading of history) by the construction of time charts; and much history also by drawing and colouring historical maps. With geometrical drawing one passes insensibly into mathematics. And so much has been done not only to revolutionize the teaching of modern languages, but also to popularize the results, that I may content myself with a mere mention of the names of Rippmann, S. Alge, Hölzel, and Gouin as typical of the new ways.|$|R

Estate of Henry PaechterHermann Struck was born Chaim Aaron ben David in 1876 in Germany. He {{is best known as}} a master etcher, {{lithographer}} and early Zionist. He studied for five years at the Berlin Academy and in 1908 wrote Die Kunst des Radierens (The Art of Etching), while mentoring artists such as Marc Chagall, Max Liebermann and Lesser Ury. His art was included in an exhibition at the Fifth Zionist Congress and he helped establish the religious Zionist movement called Mizrachi. Struck was an Orthodox Jew but believed that culture and religion could thrive cooperatively in Israel. He immigrated to Haifa where he created an artistic community and participated {{in the development of the}} Tel Aviv Museum and the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{tools of}} the architect were the drawing board or draughting table, T-square and set squares, protractor, <b>compasses,</b> <b>pencil</b> and drawing pens of different types. Drawings were made on vellum, coated linen, and on tracing paper. Lettering would either be done by hand, mechanically using a stencil, {{or a combination of}} the two. Ink lines were drawn with a ruling pen, a relatively sophisticated device similar to a dip-in pen but with adjustable line width, capable of producing a very fine controlled line width. Ink pens had to be dipped into ink frequently. Draughtsmen worked standing up, and kept the ink on a separate table to avoid spilling ink on the drawing.|$|R
40|$|Soybean {{is one of}} {{the major}} food source commodity. As healthy phyto-protein source, since it has high protein and low fat, has {{important}} role in raise people nutrition. Domestic Soybean needs increased fast each years, but until now it wasn’t able to be fulfilled by domestic production, so that needs import in large amount. In 2007, domestic soybean consumption reached 2, 06 million tons, while domestic production in 2007 only 0, 59 million tons (Alimoeso 2007), the rest came from import. The research aimed to find out the influence of organic fertilizer and rhizobacter to soybean plant burangrang cultivation and fertilizer and rhizobacter dose fit with soybean plant burangrang cultivation. Hypothesis stated there is interaction between organic fertilizer and Rhizobacter to soybean plant burangrang cultivation development and result. There expected the organic fertilizer combination influenced soybean plant burangrang cultivation development and result. There expected Rhizobacter influenced soybean plant burangrang cultivation development and result. The research was done in Jiwut village Nglegok sub-district, Blitar Residence with 241 m upper sea height with coordinate (GPS) 643823 Me- 9104094 mN, while research started in 28 August 2009 until 3 December 2009. material used in this research were soybean plant burangrang cultivation, organic fertilizer and Rhizobacter. Tools used in soil management was mattock, while tool for measurement and data collection were plastic pocket, ruler, <b>pencil,</b> <b>compasses</b> and scales. The research used Complete Random Design (RAK) consisted of three repeats. First factor was organic fertilizer and second factor was Rhizobacter. Factor I. Organic Fertilizer (P) with three phases they were P 1 : chicken, P 2 : goat, P 3 : cow, while factor II. Rhizobacter (R) with five phases they were :R 0 : control, R 1 : IMRG kind 5, R 2 : IMRG kind 19, R 3 : IMRG kind 30, R 4 combination IMRG 5 + IMRG 19 + IMRG 30. Research application consisted of soil processing and treatment, maintenance and observation parameter. Obvservation were done by two ways, non-destructive and destructive. Observation parameters consisted of: height, leaves amount, leaf width, seeds amount, weight 100 seeds, dry weight from harvest, seeds result per meter. The result showed no interaction between fertilizer organic and rhizobacter in parameter plant height, leaves amount, and leaf width in all observation age. Chicken fertilizer treatment gave real influence to height parameter in 30 days treatment, cow fertilizer treatment gave real influence to height parameter in 70 days treatment, and in leaves amount parameter, in 60 and 70 days treatment and leaf width in 70 days observation.

60|$|October 20 and 21.--Still cold, with {{a continual}} drizzle of rain, and I {{have not been}} able to leave the cabin. This {{confinement}} makes me feel weak and depressed. Goring came in to see me, but his company did not tend to cheer me up much, as he hardly uttered a word, but contented himself with staring at me in a peculiar and rather irritating manner. He then got up and stole out of the cabin without saying anything. I am beginning to suspect that the man is a lunatic. I think I mentioned that his cabin is next to mine. The two are simply divided by a thin wooden partition which is cracked in many places, some of the cracks being so large that I can hardly avoid, as I lie in my bunk, observing his motions in the adjoining room. Without any wish to play the spy, I see him continually stooping over what appears to be a chart and working with a <b>pencil</b> and <b>compasses.</b> I have remarked the interest he displays in matters connected with navigation, but I am surprised that he should take the trouble to work out the course of the ship. However, it is a harmless amusement enough, and no doubt he verifies his results by those of the Captain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{figure of}} Maury faces eastward, toward the Atlantic Ocean that the [...] "Pathfinder of the Seas" [...] charted. He holds {{in his left}} hand a <b>pencil</b> and <b>compass</b> and in his right hand a copy of his charts. Beside his left foot is his book, Physical Geography of the Sea, as well as a Bible, {{indicating}} the central role that faith played in Maury's life. A globe of the Earth is tilted slightly on its axis behind his head. It represents both land and sea, and the woman standing calmly is a representation of Mother Nature between the land and sea. Around the base of the globe are depictions of people clinging to a sinking boat in bad weather representing the dangers of the sea with a woman in the center, and on the right (north) side of the globe there is a farmer, boy and a dog representing Maury's work promoting land weather service, which dates back further than 1853. Maury attended the International Meteorological Organization in Brussels, Belgium on August 23, 1853, where Maury, leading the way for this conference with his ideas of land and sea weather predictions and representing the United States, promoted his ideas of safety on both land and at sea to many nations which agreed to follow his ideas. Every maritime nation had its ships reporting to Maury at the National (later Naval) Observatory in Washington D.C. These elements represent Maury's work with atmospheric science, to the benefit of all mankind and their enterprises on land and on the sea. Weather warnings and reports had been dreams of Maury during his lifetime up until when he died and he was successful in his work. He thought of the ships at sea as [...] "a thousand temples of science for all of humanity" [...] and believed these brought men and nations closer together in a common self-protection against storms and deaths. There are fish, dolphins, jellyfish and birds around the monument's perimeter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{the past}} all {{engineering}} students took a drafting class. This involved {{the use of}} T-squares, triangles, architectural scales, pounce, eraser shields, bow <b>compasses,</b> <b>pencils,</b> and patience. It gave students {{a sense of how}} drawings and diagrams are made and used. As new subjects have come into the curriculum most engineering programs have dropped the drafting requirement, or at least replaced it with a computerbased CAD course. Also dropped, as a consequence, is the ability of engineering students to visually express the ideas they see in class and those that form in their heads. This paper describes the effort to address this change. This project {{is the result of a}} joint effort between an engineering and an art professor to empower students with the simple skills of producing reliable hand drawings for their notes and when expressing their design ideas. The result is a one-hour, lunch-time seminar open to engineering and science students to improve their technical freehand sketching techniques. They were coached by both professors in the techniques of hand sketching, including drawing straight and orthogonal lines, circles and ellipses, 2 - and 3 -D diagrams, graphs and charts, and labeling and lettering. Specific activities were used to gauge the improvement by the students as they progressed through the onesemester mini-course. This paper shares the best and the worst of this endeavor.
