Shortly afterward Daimler-Benz bought out SMH's remaining stake in the company. MCC was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler-Benz (which soon merged with Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler). The office in Biel was shut down and operations were consolidated at the MCC GmbH design centre in Germany. On January 1, 1999, MCC GmbH {{changed its name to}} MCC smart GmbH, and by 2000, it dropped the last vestiges of the association with SMH, becoming smart GmbH.|$|E
40|$|For highly {{innovative}} products the actual <b>product</b> <b>use</b> is often very uncertain. However, the uncertainty/variability in <b>product</b> <b>use</b> {{and its impact}} on product reliability has rarely been explored. The mismatch between the anticipated <b>product</b> <b>use</b> and the actual <b>product</b> <b>use</b> can lead to considerable unexpected technical and non-technical reliability risks. However, traditional reliability management techniques focus primarily on managing technical reliability risks. This situation results in an increasing amount of no-fault-found or fault-not-found reports in the highly innovative consumer electronics (CE) industry. Under the time-to-market pressure, it is increasingly important to take into consideration the significant factors that determine <b>product</b> <b>use</b> in the early product development process. In the Software Reliability Engineering (SRE) framework, a top-down approach (operational profile) is used to analyse the <b>product</b> <b>use.</b> However, an operational profile cannot be directly applied to analyse <b>product</b> <b>use</b> for CE <b>products</b> due to the differences between the reliability of software products and that of CE products. This paper proposes an enhanced framework to structurally analyse unexpected user-product interactions for highly innovative CE products. In this framework, the product, user and environmental conditions are used to analyse user-product interactions. This framework has been implemented to analyse user-product interactions by using data from a consumer test of a highly innovative CE produc...|$|R

2500|$|Agriculture, livestock, {{forestry}} {{and fishing}} employ over 53% of the state’s population; however, its productivity {{is considered to}} be low. Agriculture includes both seasonal and perennial plants. Major crops include corn, beans, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts, sesame seeds, coffee, cacao, sugar cane, mangos, bananas, and palm oil. [...] These crops take up 95% of the cultivated land in the state and 90% of the agricultural production. Only four percent of fields are irrigated with the rest dependent on rainfall either seasonally or year round. Chiapas ranks second among the Mexican states in the production of cacao, the <b>product</b> <b>used</b> to make chocolate, and is responsible for about 60 percent of Mexico's total coffee output. The production of bananas, cacao and corn make Chiapas Mexico's second largest agricultural producer overall.|$|E

There were two quarries, {{one by the}} northern viewpoint at Windyway producing a blue stone, and the other near the Tegg's Nose summit producing Tegg's Nose Pink. Quarrying was originally by hand, giving a high-quality <b>product</b> <b>used</b> for buildings, gravestones, kerbs, flagstones and cobbles, which was used as far afield as the Isle of Man. Blasting {{was introduced in the}} 1930s, producing crushed stone for roads and airfields, and during the Second World War, rock for runways was extracted using pneumatic drills. A collection of historical quarrying equipment is preserved within the Country Park, including a jaw crusher, crane and a stone saw, which was powered by a steam engine. There is evidence of a railway track around the disused summit quarry. There is also evidence of a bomb crater at the bottom of Teggsnose caused by a German bomber during WW2 which {{can be seen from the}} summit ...|$|E
