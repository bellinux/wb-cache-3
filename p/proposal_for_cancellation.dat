30|$|In CRNs, {{the relay}} nodes can operate either in {{half-duplex}} (HD) or in full-duplex (FD) mode. In half-duplex relaying (HDR), two orthogonal time or frequency channels are allotted for the relay transmission and reception. Whereas, full-duplex relaying (FDR) allows concurrent reception and retransmission {{using the same}} frequency band. Even though FDR leads to two-fold improvement in spectral efficiency, it causes self-interference (SI) because of the coupling between the relay node’s transmitter and receiver circuits [4]. Recently several <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of SI {{have appeared in the}} literature [5, 6]. However, even with advanced SI cancellation methods, a level of residual self-interference (RSI) remains that significantly deteriorates the performance of FD systems [7 – 9]. In a FD-based CRN, the relay nodes in the secondary network operate in the FD mode [10]. The CRN based on FD would differ in performance in comparison to that of conventional HD network, due to the presence of RSI. This paper considers a cognitive FD relay (CogFDR) network in underlay mode, with a multi-hop secondary network, i.e., the secondary network comprises of a secondary transmitter (ST), a secondary receiver (SR), and N FD relay nodes connecting ST and SR. In underlay CRNs, even though the secondary users are allowed to coexist by sharing the spectrum allotted to the primary, they need to choose the transmission powers such that the interference induced at the primary receiver (PR) does not go beyond the maximum tolerable limit. This significantly affects the outage and rate performance of the secondary user in the CogFDR network. Further, the performance is affected by the amount of RSI as well, which is related to the transmission power of the relay nodes and the power gain of the corresponding channel. The major objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a model for finding the secondary users’ outage probability in a multi-hop CogFDR system and to investigate transmit power optimization for improving the secondary users’ rate and outage probability performance.|$|R
