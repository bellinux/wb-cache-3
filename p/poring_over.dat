25|$|The {{traditional}} form of Zen {{has been}} greatly altered by the Meiji restoration, but Japanese Zen still flourishes as a monastic tradition. The Zen tradition in Japan, in its customary form, required {{a great deal of}} time and discipline from monks that laity would have difficulty finding. Zen monks were often expected to have spent several years in intensive doctrinal study, memorizing sutras and <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> commentaries, before even entering the monastery to undergo kōan practice in sanzen with a Zen master. The fact that Suzuki himself was able to do so (as a layman) was largely the invention of New Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|While on harbor patrol, McNulty {{spots the}} body of a dead woman in the water. When Rawls argues the case is not in his jurisdiction, McNulty, spends three hours <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> wind and tide charts to prove the death {{occurred}} within city limits. When port authority officer Beadie Russell finds thirteen dead women in a shipping container on the Baltimore docks, McNulty again intervenes and, {{with the help of the}} medical examiner, proves that the deaths were not accidental: the air pipe to the container was deliberately closed off, and, with the help of a mining engineer, they are able to prove that the ship was within the city limits when it happened. The case is given to Bunk and Lester, who don't look forward to investigating these difficult cases.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a time of {{enlightenment}} progression occurring in all intellectual fields. However, the English language was deteriorating into a tangled mess. A group of London booksellers commissioned well-known essayist Samuel Johnson to compile a set of rules governing the English Language. After nine years and the help of six assistants the first edition of A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. Johnson's great knowledge of letters, words and literature brought uniqueness to his dictionary. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's personal touch. A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read with pleasure. The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, which a reader could be content spending an evening <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format has certainly shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.|$|E

25|$|Even {{since the}} Sylhet Referendum, it was {{propagated}} that the Hindus had voted against Pakistan {{and therefore they}} were the enemies of Pakistan. On 6 February 1950, the verdict of Bagge Tribunal was declared. The Muslims of Sylhet had anticipated that Karimganj would fall within Pakistan, but it was awarded to India. Some Muslim lawyers of Sylhet Bar Association and Muslim muktears of Karimganj threatened that there would terrible violence. On 10 February, a huge poster was hung at Bandar Bazar, the city centre of Sylhet. The poster titled Atrocities on Mussulmans by Hindus in Hindusthan, depicted the Muslims being dragged by means of ropes tied around their necks by Hindus armed with sticks and other weapons. Rivers of blood were flowing in Lumding and Kolkata, because of the Muslim killings. Local Muslims were <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> the poster and inciting fellow Muslim to take revenge on the Hindus. On 11 February, at a rally at Gobinda Park, there was cry for Hindu blood. It was rumoured that Fazlul Haque had been murdered in Kolkata. The situation deteriorated rapidly in Sylhet. On 13 February, Section 144 imposed in Sylhet, {{in accordance with the}} decision taken by the Chief Secretaries of East Bengal and West Bengal at Dhaka. A Hindu youth named Prithwish Das was stabbed at Zinda Bazar. On 14 February, rumour spread that the Muslims were being massacred at Karimganj. The Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet, addressing a meeting of lawyers made an irresponsible statement that 5,000 Muslims were killed in Karimganj and that Muslims were arriving in large numbers from Karimganj into Sylhet. In the evening, Moti Das, a Bengali Hindu youth was killed near Jallapar. Three Manipuris were stabbed, two of whom died later.|$|E

PopMatters wrote, [...] "You can spend hours <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> the lyric sheet and attempting to grok Doom’s infinitely dense verbiage. If language is arbitrary, then many of Doom’s verses exploit the essence of words stripped of meaning, random conglomerations of syllables assembled in an order that only makes sense from a rhythmical standpoint", the critic added. The Observer stated that [...] "the densely telegraphic lyrics almost always reward closer inspection" [...] and that DOOM's [...] "rhymes miss beats, drop {{into the middle of}} the next line, work their way through whole verses" [...] allows for a smooth listen.|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{was first}} {{introduced}} to locative media websites through links from a friend, and initially found the phenomenon to be [...] "excessively nerdy and very conceptual". Despite his finding compelling {{the idea of a}} digital grid mapping the surface of the earth, Gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and geohacking, and instead reworked the material into the locative art of the novel. [...] "When I started, I thought that the 'locative art' stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction", he commented in a subsequent interview. [...] "Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that." [...] The conception of the artworks in the novel was derived from the lowbrow art movement, and was inspired by the movement's talismanic Juxtapoz, the only art magazine Gibson was reading regularly at the time. The novel exhibits Gibson's characteristic brand awareness (a key plot element of Pattern Recognition), which he honed while <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> catalogues of products as part of his writing process. The author found the writing process unnerving, as the solution to the mystery of the container – the novel's MacGuffin – did not come to him until after he had written several hundred pages of manuscript.|$|E
500|$|Although {{boys were}} taught at Confucian academies for the {{ultimate}} goal of government service, girls were often taught by their brothers how to read and write. By Song times, more women of the upper and educated classes were able to read due to advances in widespread printing, leaving behind a treasury of letters, poems, and other documents penned by women. Some women were educated enough to teach their sons before they were sent to an official school. For example, the mother of the statesman and scientist Shen Kuo taught him basic education and even military strategy that she had learned from her elder brother. Hu Wenrou, a granddaughter of a famous Song official Hu Su, was regarded by Shen Kuo as a remarkable female mathematician, as Shen would occasionally relay questions to Hu Wenrou through her husband in order for her to review and investigate possible errors in his mathematical work. Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), whose father was a friend of Su Shi, wrote many poems throughout her often turbulent life (only about 100 of these survive) and became a renowned poet during her lifetime. After the death of her husband, she wrote poems profusely about <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> his paintings, calligraphy, and ancient bronze vessels, as well as poems with deep emotional longing: ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{days after}} {{receiving}} his Ph.D, Andrić wrote the Foreign Minister {{asking to be}} reinstated and submitted {{a copy of his}} dissertation, university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andrić stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andrić spent much of his time writing. His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926). In October 1926, he was assigned to the consulate in Marseille and again appointed vice-consul. On 9 December 1926, he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris. Andrić's time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation. His uncle had died in 1924, his mother the following year, and upon arriving in France, he was informed that his aunt had died as well. [...] "Apart from official contacts," [...] he wrote Alaupović, [...] "I have no company whatever." [...] Andrić spent much of his time in the Paris archives <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> the reports of the French consulate in Travnik between 1809 and 1814, material he would use in Travnička hronika (Travnik Chronicle), one of his future novels.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, Time Out {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "Zodiac isn't {{a puzzle}} film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite {{contrary to the}} flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be." [...] Peter Bradshaw in his review for The Guardian commended the film for its [...] "sheer cinematic virility," [...] and gave it four stars out of five. In his review for Empire magazine, Kim Newman gave the film {{four out of five}} stars and wrote, [...] "You'll need patience with the film's approach, which follows its main characters by <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> details, and be prepared to put up with a couple of rote family arguments and weary cop conversations, but this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can't be confirmed." [...] Graham Fuller in Sight & Sound magazine wrote, [...] "the tone is pleasingly flat and mundane, evoking the demoralising grind of police work in a pre-feminist, pre-technological era. As such, Zodiac is considerably more adult than both Seven, which salivates over the macabre cat-and-mouse game it plays with the audience, and the macho brinkmanship of Fight Club." [...] Not all British critics liked the film. David Thompson in The Guardian felt that in relation to the rest of Fincher's career, Zodiac was [...] "the worst yet, a terrible disappointment in which an ingenious and deserving all-American serial killer nearly gets lost in the meandering treatment of cops and journalists obsessed with the case." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{these few}} years at Riebeek West Jan worked assiduously at his studies — self-evidently, given his achievements. His {{academic}} abilities were soon noted by his headmaster, {{who went out}} of his way to provide Jan with further curricular reading. Yet this was to prove insufficient to meet what was becoming an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge. Jan borrowed books and yet more books from the headmaster, <b>poring</b> <b>over</b> them at all times rather than engaging in the childish pursuits of the other children, separated from them by his strong work ethic. A few weeks before the School Higher examination this had its consequences — Jan fell ill, an illness exacerbated by his unremitting study. With a strict injunction from his doctor, ordering a complete rest with an absolute prohibition on work and reading, Jan was packed off to bed. Nevertheless, despite the doctor's orders, Jan went to strenuous lengths to evade the ban. One story told of him during this enforced convalescence describes how he used to involve the headmaster's youngest son in his subterfuges, bribing the four-year-old child to bring him books from his father's study. This enjoyed considerable success until the day of an unannounced visit from the headmaster's wife. In his sparsely furnished room there were few possibilities, but Jan made the best job that he could of concealing his by now substantial collection of books. The headmaster's wife upon entering the room found Jan, as expected, in bed. However the boy did not look to be comfortably resting as he ought, in fact he looked positively uncomfortable. She offered to make Jan's bed for him, he declined, insisting that he was perfectly comfortable; she insisted and, being the headmaster's wife, got her way. Embarking upon her deed of kindness she found, to her astonishment, the real reason for Jan's restlessness — underneath his bedclothes he was making a valiant effort to conceal an immense pile of contraband books! ...|$|E
