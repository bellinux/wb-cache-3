30|$|According to the International Association of Science Parks (IASP), a {{technological}} park {{is an organization}} managed by specialized professionals that aims to increase the local community’s wealth by promoting innovation culture and industrial and institutional competitiveness. In order to do this, the park needs to encourage and manage the flow of knowledge/technology among the university, research and development (R&D) institutions, industry and market; to simplify the creation/development of innovative companies through incubation; and to provide services with value added, besides physical space. Other terminologies known are science <b>parks,</b> innovation <b>parks,</b> <b>poles,</b> and technopolis. 1 Nowadays, STIPs emerge in contexts of regional economic development. Their aims are to support the development of innovative and high-tech goods/services, {{the creation of new}} ventures, and the promotion of UIG linkages (Wegermann 2010).|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{how they}} are used {{and where they are}} located, <b>parks</b> on <b>poles</b> are an {{excellent}} alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees {{at the edge of a}} forest has the potential to work well. Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New <b>parks</b> on wood <b>poles</b> have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.|$|R
