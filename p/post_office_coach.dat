50|$|The Early Years: Sherburnâ€™s {{geographic}} location {{in all probability}} {{dates back to the}} mid 1860s. At that time, George Archer had a sod tavern on the north banks of what was then Lake Manyaska located just south of Sherburn. Marked by a lone Cedar tree, pioneer travelers used it as a rest stop as they traveled from Fairmont to Jackson. Soon there were pioneer settlers and a <b>post</b> <b>office.</b> As stage <b>coaches</b> from Fairmont to Jackson and St. James to Estherville crossed the area, it was concluded that there was a definite need for a settlement.|$|R
50|$|The lands {{located on}} the east half of lots 9, 10 and 11 of {{concession}} 7 were first patented to David Thompson on May 20, 1801. By 1830, it was a well settled community. John Smith (Schmidt), a farmer from Edgeley, came to Pine Grove where he erected a grist mill and saw mill in 1828. In 1831 he built a store. In 1840 John Smith sold the mill to John W. Gamble who later became the first reeve of Vaughan Township. The mill was sold to Gooderham and Worts in 1860. By the time of Confederation, Pine Grove was home to a flour mill, churches, three hotels, a blacksmith shop, harness shops, a spool factory, one common school and a large general store with a <b>post</b> <b>office.</b> A stage <b>coach</b> ran daily to Weston.|$|R
5000|$|Transport on a country-wide scale {{began in}} 1710 with the {{introduction}} by the General <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> of mail <b>coaches</b> on the main routes between towns. Private operators added to the routes, and an established [...] "turnpike" [...] road system started in the 1730s. In 1715 the Irish Parliament took steps to encourage inland navigation, {{but it was not}} until 1779 that the first 19 km (12 mi) section of the Grand Canal was opened. The addition of the Royal Canal and river navigation (particularly on the River Shannon) meant that freight could be transported more easily. Charles Bianconi established his horse-car services in the south in 1815, the first of many such passenger-carrying operations. Despite these improvements huge areas of Ireland still relied on a basic road system; turnpikes were still slow and canals were expensive.|$|R
