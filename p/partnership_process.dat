40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the International Labour Process Conference: [URL] article presents a detailed review of the vast partnership literature which has emerged over the last decade. It begins by examining definitions of partnership, and suggests that while academic definitions are unhelpfully vague, practitioner definitions tend to conflate <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> with <b>partnership</b> outcomes. An alternative definition based upon <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> and practices is offered. This is followed by a review of the conceptual advocates/critics debate, and the abundance of empirical partnership studies exploring trade union representative capacity/mutual gains outcomes. It is proposed that while recent empirical evidence identifies a variety of outcomes and presents various typologies of partnership, there is an absence of debates on typologies in the literature. The article then identifies several limitations of the existing literature including ideological positions, a lack of sensitivity to context and to different types of partnership, and a focus on outcomes. The article concludes by suggesting a need to understand more about the <b>process</b> of <b>partnership,</b> to clarify the meaning and expectations of partnership, and stresses the importance of evaluating partnership in context...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) {{is regarded}} as a facilitator for both small and large firms to speed up transactions between firms and their suppliers and customers, achieve real-time communication, lower transaction costs, and enhance speed and flexibility. However, understanding whether and how IT helps small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to create business value still remains unclear. Drawing upon resource-based view theory, source-positional advantage-performance framework, we develop and test a theoretical model to explore the interrelationships between IT resources (IT expertise, IT infrastructure), IT capability (IT integration), IT-enabled inter-firm <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> (activity integration, coordination, partnership enhancement), and organizational performance in the fast growth SME context. We propose that IT business value depends on how firms employ IT resources to develop IT capability which facilitates inter-firm <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> along value chains. Structural equation modeling is employed to test our theoretical conceptualization of 310 Australian fast-growth SMEs across different industrial sectors. Results show that IT contributes to fast growth SME performance through the development of IT capability and enhancement of inter-firm partnership activities. This research highlights the role of IT in business value creation {{and the ways in which}} IT is used by fast growth SMEs to foster core business competencies...|$|R

While the study suggests that a partnership approach to LA 21 may not deter business involvement, <b>partnership</b> structures and <b>processes</b> appear to be critical in engaging and sustaining business participation, particularly among SMEs. Local authorities need to be sensitive to private sector perceptions of the LA 21 process and to consider alternative methods of engaging the business community in the search for a cross-sector approach to local sustainable development...|$|R

The U.S. Department of State’s official explanation of it is, “The complementing of traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverages the networks, technologies, and demographics of our interconnected world.” “The First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review of 2010”, explains 21st century diplomacy as the United States’ adaptation to an increasingly varied set of actors who influence national debates, such as an increasing amount of states capable of acting on their own diplomatic agendas, corporations, transnational networks, foundations, NGOs, religious groups and citizens themselves. The incentive to create and embrace U.S. cyber-diplomacy and 21st century statecraft is to connect the private and civic sectors with U.S. foreign policy efforts by utilizing new resources; connection technologies and expanding, facilitating, and streamlining our public-private <b>partnership</b> <b>process.</b> Secretary of State Hillary Clinton explained the concept as [...] "We're working to leverage the power and potential in what I call 21st century statecraft.

But we're also reaching to the people behind these tools, the innovators and entrepreneurs themselves." [...] The efforts by the U.S. Department of State in cyber-diplomacy has led the State Department to currently have 230 Facebook pages, 80 Twitter accounts, 55 channels on YouTube and 40 accounts on Flickr.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the way {{in which}} anti poverty policy has been institutionalised in the social <b>partnership</b> <b>process</b> and the place of anti poverty policy in the State’s policy hierarchy. It is grounded in international academic research that seeks to explain why and how once policy ideas become firmly embedded in political institutions, such as a social <b>partnership</b> <b>process,</b> those ideas are able to structure the policy outputs of those institutions and also why such embedded policy ideas are difficult to change. In Ireland a set of ideas on the management of the economy and the relationship of those ideas to anti-poverty policy were institutionalised in the policy hierarchy from the beginning of social partnership in 1987. The institutional locking of these ideas has meant that policy making has during the life time of the <b>partnership</b> <b>process</b> taken place within this framework, explaining why anti-poverty policy has not adapted to the new economic context in Ireland, and why it is unlikely to produce stronger anti-poverty outcomes without a significant change in the macro policy environment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This article {{examines}} the roles and influence of shop stewards under workplace partnership regimes in five case study firms in the Republic of Ireland. It assess the dynamics and potential longevity of partnership relationships Design: A framework is utilised which analyses the scope, {{breadth and depth of}} union influence in terms of the structure of <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> and the capacity of agency to affect relations between shop stewards, union members and plant management. Findings: The findings show that while union representatives view partnership in a positive light, there remain problems as to the longevity of partnership owing to management control and a disconnection between national (government) and local (workplace) support mechanisms for partnership. The article concludes that social <b>partnership</b> is a <b>process</b> that remains anchored in a relationship of both antagonism and accommodation between capital and labour.

The Irish political and business classes have maintained a voluntarist industrial relations system, inherited from the British colonial presence but, over time, they have widened social dialogue first under the traditional influence of the Roman Catholic Church and, more recently, of the European Union. Social interests followed by community and voluntary sector interests were progressively incorporated in policy-making.

Setting: One remote and two rural communities in Australia. Participants: Community members, GPs, health professionals, government officers and rural medical workforce consultants. Results: High levels of community participation in recruiting and retaining GPs, organising the business model, and contributing to practice infrastructure were evident. Community participation in designing health care was uncommon. Participation was primarily to ensure viable general practice services necessary to strengthen {{the social and economic}} fabric of the community. There were factors about the decision-making and <b>partnership</b> <b>processes</b> in each of the communities that threatened the viability of community participation.

The conclusion is that operational processes and social dynamics are vital drivers of collaborative advantage.
