25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E

25|$|The ethnic {{relationship}} of Prešov Region {{is complex and}} volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of Rusyns, Slovaks and Hungarians, under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of Rusyns, while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion (Greek Catholicism). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the Rusyns through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate {{the distribution of the}} Orthodox and the Greek Catholics by the language as well as to determine the number of Rusyns because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the incorrect number of Rusyns, but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of Rusyns was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of Rusyns from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.|$|E

Altogether 669 doctoral candidates from three faculties (humanities, medicine, and behavioural sciences) from a large research-intensive Finnish University completed a doctoral student survey. The results showed that a minority of the students <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> active relational agents in terms of their scholarly communities.

2500|$|Cot–caught merger in transition: There is {{no single}} General American way to {{pronounce}} the vowels in words like cot [...] (the ah or broad a vowel) versus caught [...] (the aw vowel), largely due to a merger occurring between the two sounds {{in some parts of}} North America, but not others. American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the exact same sound (especially in the West, northern New England, West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and the Upper Midwest), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the South, the Great Lakes region, southern New England, and the Mid-Atlantic and New York metropolitan areas) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds [...] Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of cot (usually transcribed in American English as [...] ), may be a central or advanced back vowel [...] ) or , while [...] is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to [...] or , but with only slight rounding. Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two and are thus said to have undergone the cot–caught merger, [...] usually remains a back vowel, , sometimes showing lip rounding as [...] Therefore, General American speakers vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. In the middle of this range, a transitional stage of the merger is also common in random scatterings throughout the U.S., though especially among younger speakers and most consistently in the Midland region lying between the historical North and South.

[...] After some preliminary salutations and acknowledgements, Bellarmine begins by telling Foscarini that it is prudent for him and Galileo to limit themselves to treating heliocentrism as a merely hypothetical phenomenon and not a physically real one. [...] Further on he says that interpreting heliocentrism as physically real would be [...] "a very dangerous thing, likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false." [...] Moreover, while the topic was not inherently a matter of faith, the statements about it in Scripture were so by virtue of who said them—namely, the Holy Spirit. [...] He conceded that if there were conclusive proof, [...] "then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false." [...] However, demonstrating that heliocentrism merely [...] "saved the appearances" [...] could not be regarded as sufficient to establish that it was physically real. [...] Although he believed that the former may well have been possible, he had [...] "very great doubts" [...] that the latter would be, and in case of doubt it was not permissible to depart from the traditional interpretation of Scriptures. His final argument was a rebuttal of an analogy that Foscarini had made between a moving Earth and a ship on which the passengers <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> apparently stationary and the receding shore as apparently moving. [...] Bellarmine replied {{that in the case of}} the ship the passengers know that their perceptions are erroneous and can mentally correct them, whereas the scientist on the Earth clearly experiences that it is stationary and therefore the perception that the Sun, moon and stars are moving is not in error and does not need to be corrected.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Rates of weight-based stigmatization have {{steadily}} {{increased over}} the past decade. The psychological and physiological consequences of weight stigma remain understudied. Methods: This study {{examined the effects of}} experimentally manipulated weight stigma on the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in 110 female undergraduate participants (BMI: M= 19. 30, SD= 1. 55). Objective BMI and self-perceived body weight were examined as moderators of the relationship between stigma and HPA reactivity. Results: Results indicated participants' perceptions of their own body weight (but not objective BMI) moderated the effect of weight stigma on cortisol reactivity: F(1, 102) = 13. 48, P&# 60; 0. 001, η 2 p= 0. 12 (interaction 95 % CI range [- 2. 06 to - 1. 44, - 1. 31 to - 0. 99]).

Methods: In this retrospective study, 304 adolescents before they had measured their height and weight, they self-reported these measures, they were asked about their body shape perception and body image classification was obtained by using a body silhouette scale. It was also used specific tests to assess body satisfaction and food behavior. Results: It was found full agreement between height-for-age classification using self-reported and measured height (k = 1. 00) and an intermediate level of agreement between body mass index calculated with self-reported and measured data (k < 0. 75). However,adolescents who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> "skinny" underestimated their self-reported body mass index whereas those who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> "fat" overestimated it. Those who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> fat in the silhouette scale underestimated their body mass index. Gender was also a factor for unreliable answers, as females tended to underestimate their self-reported body mass index and males to overestimate it.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{perceived}} level of professional competence of Brazilian college coaches, considering the type of sports discipline and professional development cycles. The target population consisted of 92 sport coaches of both genders from various regions of Brazil, who worked in team or individual sports. An adapted version of the Self-Perception of Competence Scale was used for data collection. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests, adopting a level of significance of 5 %. The coaches <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> competent in knowledge on the theory and methodology of sports training and sports biodynamics, as well as in the skills of sports planning and management. On the other hand, the coaches perceived fragility of knowledge on sports management and legislation. With respect to professional development cycles, more experienced coaches <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> more competent than those with a shorter coaching experience. When coaches of individual and team sports were compared, a significant difference (p = 0. 04) was only observed for knowledge on sports management and legislation, with coaches of team sports <b>perceiving</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> more competent.
