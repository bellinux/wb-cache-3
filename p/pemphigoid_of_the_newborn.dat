Materials and Methods: <b>The</b> medical records <b>of</b> 709 newborns monitored with a diagnosis <b>of</b> hyperbilirubinemia in <b>the</b> Yüzüncü Yıl University Medical Faculty Research Hospital Child Health and Diseases Clinic, Turkey, were examined retrospectively Findings: ABO incompatibility was determined in 165 (23. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn,</b> Rh incompatibility was determined in 80 (11. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> and ABO+Rh incompatibility was determined in 13 (0. 018 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn.</b> Direct hyperbilirubinemia was determined in 28 (3. 9 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn.</b> Clinical symptoms and findings regarding kernicterus were found in 66 (9. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn.</b> Blood exchange was made in 121 (17. 1 %) of them.

An unforeseen consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opportunistic evolutionary process for SNOMED CT may be that some terms for disorders of specialised clinical domains are not represented within the terminology. The SNOMED CT July 2006 release was systematically examined using the CliniClue ® terminology browser to determine whether 434 terms for disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> infant are represented within the terminology. There was complete representation for 90. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms for disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> infant, partial representation for 6. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms, and no representation for 2. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms.

40|$|Background: Conjunctivitis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> {{is defined}} as hyperemia and eye {{discharge}} in the neonates and is a common infection occurring in the neonates in <b>the</b> first month <b>of</b> life. In <b>the</b> United States, <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> neonatal conjunctivitis ranges from 1 - 2 %, in India, the prevalence is 0. 5 - 33 % and varies in the world from 0. 9 - 21 % depending on the socioeconomic status. Aim: To study the organisms causing conjunctivitis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> and to correlate the etiology with <b>the</b> mode <b>of</b> delivery. Design: Single center, prospective, observational study. Materials and Methods: A total of 300 mothers and their newborns, born {{over a period of}} one year, were included in <b>the</b> study. <b>Of</b> these 200 newborns were delivered through vaginal route (Group A) and 100 (Group B) delivered by lower segment caesarean section (LSCS). At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> labour, high vaginal swabs were taken from the mothers. Two conjunctival swabs each from both eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> were collected at birth and transported to Microbiology department in a candle jar immediately. Results: Eight babies in Group A, developed conjunctivitis at birth. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> babies in Group B developed conjunctivitis, this difference was statistically highly significant (P< 0. 000). The organisms found in <b>the</b> conjunctiva <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> in Group A were Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, α hemolytic Streptococcus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spps. However, the commonest organism leading to conjunctivitis in <b>the</b> <b>newborn</b> in this study was Coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
