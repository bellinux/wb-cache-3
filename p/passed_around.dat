5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. The Koreans <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 22, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, guarding the support artillery behind the 27th Infantry, came under attack by the KPA 1st Division troops that had <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> the forward positions. Freeman reported to Eighth Army at 16:40 that the North Koreans had shelled the rear battery of the 37th Field Artillery Battalion, that North Korean infantry were between the US 27th and US 23rd Regiments on the road, and that other North Korean groups had <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> {{the east side of}} his forward battalion. An intense artillery barrage began falling on the headquarters area of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion at 16:05, and 25 minutes later two direct hits destroyed the fire direction center, killing four officers and two non-commissioned officers. The individual batteries quickly took over control of the battalion fires and continued to support the infantry, while the battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company withdrew under fire.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the North American Union exists only as a {{proposal}} contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and {{form the basis of}} all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, May 24, {{they set}} out again, but stopped for breakfast after about three miles. As they {{finished}} eating, about 30 warriors approached. The men retreated, but four were shot and killed. Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler, William Hale, and Aaron Hawley. An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones, who was St. Vrain's brother-in-law {{and the man who}} identified his body, said the warriors had scalped the dead men, but also cut off the hands, head, and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart. They reportedly <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> pieces of the heart for the braves to eat. At least one source indicated that the mutilation began before St. Vrain was dead.|$|E

5|$|Baccano! is a 2007 anime series {{directed}} by Takahiro Omori and produced by Brain's Base and Aniplex. The 16 episodes are {{adapted from the}} light novels {{of the same name}} written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. Told in out-of-order sequences, the story spans three consecutive years of Prohibition-era America during which three seemingly unconnected events occur: two bottles of immortality elixir are <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> Manhattan by gangsters believing it is alcohol, a supposed monster massacres members of two gangs attempting to hijack the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot, and a man is tracked down by his sister and a gang. The first thirteen episodes aired in Japan from July 26, 2007 to November 1, 2007 on WOWOW, a Japanese pay-per-view station, and the final three were released direct-to-DVD. The series made its North American television debut when it started airing on the Funimation Channel after the channel transitioned to HD in September 2010.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E

25|$|Van Dorn {{proved to}} be more {{effective}} as a cavalry commander; his action in a raid at Holly Springs, Mississippi, on December 20, 1862, seriously disrupted Ulysses S. Grant's first Vicksburg Campaign plans, capturing 1,500 soldiers and destroying at least $1,500,000 USD worth of Union supplies. Van Dorn and his men then followed the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, fought unsuccessfully at Davis's Mills, skirmished near Middleburg, Tennessee, <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> Bolivar, and returned to their Grenada base by December 28.|$|E
25|$|The {{pamphlet}} {{came into}} circulation in January 1776, after the Revolution had started.

Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history.

25|$|The {{disaster}} was {{met with}} worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss {{of life and the}} regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety.

Additionally, several new wireless regulations were <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.|$|E

Amid allegations of bribery, Hosokawa argued that the money was a loan and produced a receipt to show that he had paid it back; LDP members <b>passed</b> <b>around</b> a copy remarking that it looked like a sloppy fake. Although Hosokawa still had high public approval at the time, opinion was growing that he could not meet the expectations set at the start of his term.|$|E
