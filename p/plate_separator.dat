In the microbial production of advanced biofuels, oil droplets are produced under turbulent conditions in an aqueous medium containing many surface active components, which might hinder the recovery of the product. Knowledge of DSD is thus essential for process optimisation. This study demonstrates the capability of a photo-optical measurement method for DSD measurement in fermentation broth and in plate separators aimed at cost reduction in the microbial production of advanced biofuels. Measurements were made with model mixtures in a bioreactor, and at the inlet and outlet of a <b>plate</b> <b>separator.</b> In the bioreactor, the method was effective in detecting a broad range of droplet sizes and in differentiating other disperse components (e. g. microbial cells and gas bubbles).

It was effective and reliable to press the stack with a suitable stacking pressure. It was facile and simple to assemble a stack by using electrode-SPA. With the electrode-SPAs, two NICK stacks were assembled in co-flow and counter-flow, respectively. The performance of Stack B in counter-flow was higher than that of Stack A in co-flow at the same current density. The more uniform temperature distribution and current density distribution in Stack B were responsible for its higher performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The co-current flow is achieved using 4 increasing sizes of frustum, whereas cross flow uses inclined coalescence plates running along the radius of the separator. The different arrangement gave the cross flow separator a higher coalescence plan area per operational volume, minimal and constant travelling distance for the oil droplets and particles, lower retention time, and higher operational flowrate.

40|$|Energy, in any form, {{plays the}} most {{important}} role in the modern world. We have been dependent on conventional energy sources such as coal and petroleum product for quite a long time. Therefore, there is an alarming need for more environmentally sustainable alternative energy resources. This thesis focuses on studies of microbial fuel cells (MFC). MFC devices use electro active bacteria to oxidize organic substrates degrading wastes and generating electricity. In the present study the effect of bacterial biofilms thickness, charge transport and power generation was studied in single chamber electrochemical cell using acetate as an electron donor. The thicker biofilms display higher charge transport diffusion co-efficient than that in thinner films, as increased film porosity of these films improves ion transport, required to maintain electro-neutrality upon electrolysis. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique was used to understand the effect of initial electro active bacterial attachment and deposition on gold electrode. It was observed that the viscoelastic properties of the biofilm increased as function of time leading to the better current generation. An attempt has been made to produce low cost MFC from the earthen plate, without involving any costly membrane. The material of the earthen plate used is found to be effective for ion transfer. The earthen <b>plate</b> <b>separator</b> is 99 % cheaper than the Nafion membrane, showing promise as an alternate separator for application to MFC technology. The proteomics analysis of Geobacter sulfurreducens growth on carbon cloth electrodes versus planktonic cells revealed different protein expression depending on the nature the of terminal electron acceptor. The majority of the proteins are localized in the cell membrane and involved in energy metabolism, binding and transport functional categories. In the present study the effect of influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration (2000 - 4000 mg/L) and feed temperature (15 ÂºC - 32 ÂºC) on COD removal efficiency and power generation was studied in dual chambered MFC treating synthetic and real dairy wastewater.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia Química e BiológicaLipids are {{ubiquitous}} in industrial wastewater {{produced in the}} food industry, yet practically no biological treatment systems {{are available on the}} market that are capable of directly treating wastewater containing lipids. In general, lipids are considered a nuisance and are normally removed prior to biological treatment. Lipids are however compounds with a high calorific value and therefore highly interesting for conversion into biogas under anaerobic conditions. This thesis reports on the development of a high-rate anaerobic reactor capable of directly treating wastewater containing fat. The reactor’s technological basis for includes floatation as main sludge retention technique. Next to that, the specific contact surface between sludge and fat is maximised to prevent mass transfer limitation. Because fat degradation leads again to settlable sludge, a sedimentation step is incorporated {{in the form of a}} tilted <b>plate</b> <b>separator</b> (TPS). The settled sludge is then recycled and mixed up with raw wastewater to stimulate fat adsorption and sludge floatation. The sludge/raw wastewater mixture is subsequently injected into downers to induce reactor mixing and the break-up of floating sludge. Finally, to counteract foam formation, treated wastewater is sprayed in the head space. These considerations formed the basis of the Inverted Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (IASB) reactor. The IASB concept was tested using several lab-scale configurations and lead to an optimised 1. 2 m 3 pilot scale reactor. Its robustness and capacity for treating wastewater strongly fluctuating in quality while maintaining treatment efficiency was demonstrated during a one year pilot trial on slaughterhouse wastewater. Until an organic loading rate of 12 kg COD/m 3 /day, no problems were encountered in terms of COD removal. The TPS showed to be efficient in retaining solids inside the reactor. The spray flow rate, however, should not go through the TPS. The IASB technology is currently being scaled-up to industrial scale taking the pilot findings into account. A modular approach was chosen as to reduce investment costs associated to the technology. The IASB technological development further resulted in a novel separation technology called Sludge Lift Separator. Separator design was optimised using computational fluid dynamics. The technology is currently being tested at pilot scale...|$|E

40|$|Any future lunar {{base and}} habitat must be {{constructed}} from strong dense materials {{in order to}} provide for thermal and radiation protection. Lunar soil may meet this need. Lunar regolith has high concentrations of aluminum, silicon, calcium, iron, sodium, and titanium oxides. Refinement or enrichment of specific minerals in the soil before it is chemically processed may be more desirable as it would reduce the size and energy requirements required to produce the virgin material and it may significantly reduce the process' complexity. Also, investigations into the potential production of breathable oxygen from oxidized mineral components are a major research initiative by NASA. In this study. the objective was to investigate the use of tribocharging to charge lunar simulants and pass them through a parallel <b>plate</b> <b>separator</b> to enrich different mineral fractions. This technique takes advantage of the high Lunar vacuum in which much higher voltages can be used on the separation plates than in air. Additionally, the Lunar g 1 avity, only being 1 / 6 that of Earth, allows the particles more separation time between the plates and therefore enhances separation. For the separation studies, two lunar stimulants were used. The first simulant was created in-house, labeled KSC- 1. using commercially supplied (sieved to 325 mesh) materials, and was composed of 40 wt. % feldspar ((Na,K,Ca) AlSi 3 O 8;SiO 2), 40 wt. % olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4), 10 wt. % ilmenite (FeTiO 3). and 10 wt. % spodumene (LiAlSi 2 O 6) (pyroxene). The advantage of the in-house mixture is that the composition can he varied to simulate different soil compositions from different areas on the moon. This simulant was used to show proof-of-concept using the designed separator in air. The second stimulant was JSC- 1. used for the vacuum experiments. JSC- 1 is principally basalts, containing phases of plagioclase. pyroxene. olivine, and ilmenite. The JSC- 1 was sieved to provide a 50 - 75 micron size range to correlate with the mean grain size found on the moon's surface [1]. Four different materials were investigated for the triboelectrification process; aluminum, copper. stainless steel, and PTFE. These materials were selected because they offer a wide variation in work functions (aluminum 4. 28 eV, copper 4. 65 eV. stainless steel 5. 04 eV, and PTFE 5. 75 eV). The difference between the work function of each material and the simulant influences the charge obtained by the grains. Each simulant was analyzed before and after separation using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to determine mineral surface composition. In addition. Raman spectroscopy was performed on the JSC- 1 before and after separation in vacuum to determine the mineral composition. Charge-to-mass (Q/M) measurements were performed using a fluidizing bed in air and passing the simulant through a static mixer of a particular material and collecting it in a Faraday pail grounded through an electrometer. To measure the Q/M in vacuum, a special device was constructed consisting of a heater/shaker cup that fed into a solid block of material (either PTFE, copper, or aluminum) in which a channel composed of a "zig-zag" series of inclines greater than 50 degrees has been cut. The voltage to the vibrating motor can be varied to control the amount of simulant passing through the channel. Figure I shows the Q/M measurements for JSC- 1 tribocharged using the static mixers and the incline plane chargers in air, and the incline plane chargers in vacuum...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{electrostatic}} separators. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic <b>plate</b> <b>separators</b> work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons {{to the plate and}} are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, {{one of the most important}} is the water content of the particles.

Inevitably, conventional activated sludge treatment processes required the greater land take, but it was the only proven technology as far as the client was concerned. Other treatment processes, loosely termed "small footprint", could be accommodated within a much smaller area.
