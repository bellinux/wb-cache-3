2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound. Of those that were, only one, not unflawed study, showed {{a reduction in the}} frequency of stuttering to less than 5% of words spoken. In addition, potentially serious side effects of pharmacological treatments were noted, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunctions and the potential for blood pressure increases. There is one new drug studied especially for stuttering named <b>pagoclone,</b> which was found to be well-tolerated [...] "with only minor side-effects of headache and fatigue reported in a minority of those treated".|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacologist}} David Nutt {{has suggested}} <b>pagoclone</b> {{as a possible}} base from which {{to make a better}} social drug, as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage. Its effect can be quickly reversed by the action of flumazenil, which is already used as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose. Nutt has published studies praising the potential of <b>pagoclone</b> which were financed by Indevus which was seeking funding for a possible production of the compound. The long-term safety of <b>pagoclone</b> has not been assessed. The abuse potential of <b>pagoclone</b> has been assessed as being similar to, or slightly less than that of diazepam and it would also be expected to be somewhat safer due to its relatively weaker sedative effects, but development of <b>pagoclone</b> as a commercial drug would still be unlikely due to concerns about abuse. <b>Pagoclone</b> was trialed as a drug to improve a stammerer's speech fluency, but research for this application was discontinued following disappointing results in Phase II clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pagoclone</b> is an {{anxiolytic}} agent from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known {{drugs such as}} the sleeping medication zopiclone. It was synthesized by a French team working for Rhone-Poulenc & Rorer S.A. <b>Pagoclone</b> belongs to the class of nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures. It was never commercialised.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pagoclone</b> and {{pazinaclone}} {{are both}} isoindoloneReaction of 2-Amino-7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridine with phthalic anhydride {{leads to the}} corresponding phthalimide. Selective reduction {{of one of the}} imide carbonyl groups give the corresponding alcohol. Reaction with the carbanion from Ethyl 5-methyl-3-oxohexanoate leads to the product from the displacement of the hydroxyl group; 'this too may proceed via the acrylate obtained from aldol reaction of the ring opened imidal'.|$|E
50|$|It binds with roughly {{equivalent}} high affinity (0.7-9.1 nM) to the benzodiazepine binding site of human GABAA receptors containing either an α1, α2, α3 or α5 subunit. It is a partial agonist at α1-, α2- and α5-containing GABAA receptors {{and a full}} agonist at receptors containing an α3 subunit. In rats 5′-hydroxypagoclone {{was identified as a}} major metabolite. This metabolite has a considerably greater efficacy at the α1 subtype than the parent compound and was shown to have significant anxiolytic-like activity and to produce sedation. In contrast to zopiclone, <b>pagoclone</b> produces anxiolytic effects with little sedative or amnestic actions at low doses.|$|E
50|$|More recently, a {{range of}} non-sedating {{anxiolytic}} drugs derived from the same structural families as the Z-drugs have been developed, such as alpidem (Ananyxl) and <b>pagoclone,</b> and approved for clinical prescription. Nonbenzodiazepine drugs are much more selective than the older benzodiazepine anxiolytics, producing effective relief of anxiety/panic {{with little or no}} sedation, anterograde amnesia, or anticonvulsant effects, and are thus potentially more precise than older, anti-anxiety drugs. However, anxiolytic nonbenzodiazepines are not widely prescribed and many have collapsed after initial clinical trials and consumption halted many projects, including but not limited to alpidem, indiplon, and suriclone.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not {{approved}} any drug for the direct treatment of stuttering. However, {{the effectiveness of}} pharmacological agents, such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotic and antihypertensive medications, and dopamine antagonists {{in the treatment of}} stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.A comprehensive review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound.

Preclinical studies suggest that <b>pagoclone</b> may have clinical utility as an anxiolytic agent, as well as a reduced incidence of side-effects. The present study was conducted to determine whether <b>pagoclone</b> would affect healthy individuals&rsquo; performances on neuropsychological measures as a function of dose within the projected therapeutic range. Twelve healthy adult subjects were randomly assigned to dosage groups in a 3 -way crossover study. Participants were administered neuropsychological measures six hours following dosing on Day 1 and Day 6 of administration of the drug. Dose effects were noted on measures of alertness, learning, and memory and movement time. Significant effects were also noted on measures of alertness, learning and memory, information processing and psychomotor speed. Overall, the results of this small, preliminary study do not support a finding of behavioral toxicity for these doses of <b>pagoclone.</b> Rather, a pattern was found of transient and mild negative effects on learning and memory scores at the highest dose administered, though these changes were small and no longer evident by the sixth day of use.
