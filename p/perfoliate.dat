40|$|Favorinus GRAY, 1850 is {{a splendid}} genus, the {{distinctive}} characters {{of which were}} introduced in parts by ALDER & HANCOCK, 1855, and somewhat more effectively by ODHNER, 1939 (see also MACNAE, 1954 a, pp. 17 - 19). Eolis alba A. & H., 1844, Atlantic, forms the type of the genus. A series of species were added to this genus by the senior author (F. pacificus BABA, 1937; F. japonicus BABA, 1949; F. perfoliatus BABA, 1949; and F. mirabilis BABA, 1955), and {{it was revealed that}} the rhinophores in Favorinus are either simple, or bulbed, or even <b>perfoliated</b> according to different species. Here F. japonicus BABA was taken up for special study in anatomy, with the hope to understand the various genetic features more profoundly than before. Apparently this species is one of those nearest to the type of the genus, particularly in having bulbs on the mid-length of the rhinophores...|$|R

25|$|Over {{much of its}} range, <b>perfoliate</b> {{pondweed}} {{is unlikely}} to be confused with any other pondweed species except perhaps P. praelongus. In North America it could be confused with P. richardsonii, but the latter has stipules that disintegrate to persistent fibres even on {{the lower part of the}} stem, whereas those of P. perfoliatus disintegrate entirely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perfoliate</b> {{pondweed}} is {{not widely}} cultivated, which is perhaps surprising {{as it is}} not ecologically demanding and is an attractive plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants {{needs to be able}} to root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Keeping nutrient levels low helps to prevent smothering by algae and more invasive aquatic plants. Plants being established should be weighted down initially to allow them to root, and benefit from being planted among other aquatic plants that can act as a 'nursery'. Transplants have a high survival rate once established.|$|E
2500|$|Potamogeton perfoliatus (claspingleaf pondweed, [...] <b>perfoliate</b> pondweed, The {{submerged}} {{leaves are}} oval and translucent, with no stalk, 20–115mm long and 7–42mm wide, clasping the stem (<b>perfoliate),</b> a flat apex, and 5-12 veins {{on either side}} of the midrib. They vary considerably in colour and may be bright green, dark green, yellowish, olive or brownish. There are no floating leaves.

A triple hybrid, P. gramineus × lucens × perfoliatus (P. × torssandrii (Tiselius) Dörfler), is also known. Many of these hybrids are perennial and long-lived, sometimes occurring {{in the absence of}} one or even both parents. Therefore, care should be taken with identification of unusual specimens.|$|E
