40|$|The {{population}} density of larvae {{of the three}} corn borers species : greater pink borer, #Sesamia cretica$ Led., European corn borer, #Ostrinia nubilalis$ (Hubner), and <b>purple-lined</b> <b>borer,</b> #Chilo agamemnon$ Bles, was studied during 1994 and 1995 at Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate. Generally, the population varied greatly according to insecticide treatment, corn borer species, and plantation. In the early summer planting, {{population density}} of #S. cretica$ was greater {{than the other two}} species, while in the late summer planting, #O. nubilalis$ was the most dominant borer. The recommended insecticides used against corn borers resulted in remarkable reductions in the infestation and, consequently, increase maize yield in the treated plots compared to those untreated. There were no noticeable differences between the number of #S. cretica$ larvae on insecticide or #Sesamia cretica$ Granulosis Virus (ScGV) treated plots. Corrected yields in kg/ha were 6901, 5509 and 4391 for methomyl, ScGV, and control treatments in 1995 and 6351, 4362, 4055, and 3400 for methomyl, high dose of ScGV, low dose of ScGV and control treatments in 1996, respectively.
