40|$|We {{investigated}} the hypotheses that: 1) differences in metal uptake exist between dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) clones sampled from unpolluted and <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> when grown in polluted media; and 2) differences in metal uptake into dandelion roots versus leaves exist for clones sampled from unpolluted and <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> when grown in polluted media. These hypotheses were tested by performing reciprocal planting experiments where dandelion clones sampled from two unpolluted and two <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> were grown pairwise in unpolluted (nutrient solution only) and polluted (nutrient solution + 120 mg kg- 1 Cu, 700 mg kg- 1 Pb, and 260 mg kg- 1 Zn) media. Clones sampled from <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> sequestered significantly greater quantities of Cu, Pb, and Zn on both a concentration (root vs. leaves; mg kg- 1) and total plant basis than clones sampled from unpolluted sites (ANOVA, P ≤ 0. 05). When grown in polluted media clones from <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> accumulated 4. 2 {{times as much}} Cu, 17. 76 times as much Pb, and 4. 2 times as much Zn in their tissues than clones sampled from unpolluted sites. Overall, dandelion clones sequestered significantly more Cu, Pb, and Zn in their root tissues than in their leaf tissues (ANOVA, P ≤ 0. 05), regardless of the site type from which they were sampled. These results reveal that dandelions are Cu, Pb, and Zn accumulators and not strict excluders, and that differences in metal uptake capabilities exist among North American clonal genotypes.

5000|$|Constitution Marsh sits {{adjacent}} to Foundry Cove, which was heavily polluted by industrial waste from a nickel-cadmium battery manufacturing plant that operated between 1952 and 1979. In total, 115904 lb of cadmium was released into Foundry Cove, making it [...] "the most cadmium <b>polluted</b> <b>site</b> in the world." [...] Some {{of the metal}} spread to Constitution Marsh in high concentration pockets. Sediment dredging efforts in the early 1970s were largely unsuccessful, and extremely high levels of both nickel and cadmium were later observed in the cove and marsh; as a result, the Environmental Protection Agency listed the area as a Superfund site in 1983. Federal remediation of the site was completed in 1995 after extensive dredging conducted in Foundry Cove. Long-term sediment and water monitoring was prescribed for Constitution Marsh, as {{it was determined that}} similar dredging there would have caused disproportionate environmental damage. Additionally, the contaminants would soon be buried beneath clean sediment after the remediation of Foundry Cove. Cadmium levels rapidly decreased throughout the area, and after eight years, levels of particulate and soluble metal pollutants were lower than in the Hudson River at New York City.|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean Sea {{is facing}} a very high risk of oil {{pollution}} due to {{the high number of}} oil extractive and refining sites along the basin coasts, and the intense maritime traffic of oil tankers. All the Mediterranean countries have adopted severe regulations for minimizing pollution events and bioremediation feasibility studies for the most urgent <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> are undergoing. However, the analysis of the scientific studies applying modern 'meta-omics' technologies that have been performed on marine oil pollution worldwide showed that the Southern Mediterranean side has been neglected by the international research. Most of the studies in the Mediterranean Sea have been done in <b>polluted</b> <b>sites</b> of the Northern side of the basin. Those of the Southern side are poorly studied, despite many of the Southern countries being major oil producers and exporters.

There was a relatively slow disappearance of SDS in die-away tests for both planktonic and epilithic populations taken from the clean source site, as compared with those taken from the downstream <b>polluted</b> <b>sites,</b> for which the rate of biodegradation was accelerated, sometimes after an apparent initial lag period.
