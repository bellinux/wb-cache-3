40|$|Introduction: Posterior {{composites}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular filling materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the problems of general dentists during and after posterior composite restorations in city of Babol. Materials &Methods: In this study, data were collected using questionnaire about the problems during and after posterior composite filling. Then data were analyzed by chi square test. Results: The highest complains of patients after posterior composite filling were related to the food impaction (33. 4 %), the most clinician's problem during posterior composite filling was inadequate proximal contact (37. 2 %) and most of dentists used <b>pressing</b> <b>matrix</b> band for proper proximal contact (31. 2 %). Most of dentists used incremental technique for composite filling (49. 3 %) and two-step total etch adhesives (68. 7 %) according to the manufacturer's instructions (44. 2 %) and applied wet polishing technique (75. 6 %) and major criteria for choosing composite as restorative material in posterior teeth were the ability of isolation (41. 8 %). Conclusion: Increasing the knowledge of dentists about these restorations may reduce the associated problems during and after composite filling...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMgAl 2 O 4 and x wt% ZrO 2 -MgAl 2 O 4 (1 # x # 30) {{composite}} powders {{were prepared}} by the urea combustion route. The powders were further ground by either ball milling or attrition to refine the grain size. Zirconia was found solely in the tetragonal form. Dense materials were prepared by hot <b>pressing.</b> The spinel <b>matrix</b> grains were submicronic in size. The ZrO 2 particles were homogeneously dispersed at the grain junctions of the matrix, and their average size increased from less than 0. 20 mm to ca. 0. 45 mm with increasing content of ZrO 2. The formation of monoclinic ZrO 2 particles proceeded accordingly, being easier in materials with a finer matrix grain size (ex-attrition) ...|$|R
40|$|Several nickel {{aluminide}} matrix composites were prepared using vacuum hot <b>pressing</b> techniques. The <b>matrix</b> compositions, based on Ni 3 Al, Ni 3 Al+B, and NiAl, were reinforced with 10 vol pct TiB 2 particles. Both smooth- and notched-bend {{tests were conducted}} at room temperature on the monolithic {{as well as the}} reinforced materials {{in order to determine the}} effects of TiB 2 reinforcement on both the smooth-bend and notched-bend properties. TiB 2 additions were shown to improve the smooth-bend strengths regardless of the matrix composition, while notched-bend tests, conducted to provide estimates of fracture toughness, revealed somewhat lower values for the composites in comparison to the monolithic materials. Fractographic analyses and in situ fracture observations of the composites revealed that preferential fracture in regions of clustered TiB 2 particles may significantly affect the measured toughnesses...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{dissipator}} prototypes for {{the cooling}} {{of static converters}} were prepared by hot pressing using aluminium nitride of high thermal conductivity (108 W/mK) as material. The application of such AlN dissipators enables the substitution of the conventional cooling agents (mineral oil, halogenated hydrocarbons) by the unproblematic medium water. In {{the frame of the}} present project basic principles for the application of the more economical <b>matrix</b> <b>pressing</b> technology in the manufacturing of AlN based dissipators have been elaborated. Quasi-single phase aluminium nitride ceramics of high thermal conductivity (up to 190 W/mK) were obtained by sintering under normal pressure as well as by hot pressing using Y_ 2 O_ 3 as a sinter additive.

40|$|Abstract. The {{precision}} turning experiments {{of aluminium}} composites reinforced with SiC whisker reinforcements were done by polycrystalloid diamond (PCD) tools. The measure {{analysis of the}} machined surface was carried out with Atom Force Microscope (AFM) and Scan Electronic Microscope (SEM). The roughness values of the machined surface were measured by Talysurf- 6. The {{results show that the}} orientation of reinforcements in the machined surface will directly affect the deformation mechanism of SiC whiskers, microstructures of the machined surface, and to determine the quality of the machined surface. In the five types from A to E of SiC whisker orientation, the orientation of case A easily makes to produce SiC whisker deformation by cutting off directly, and to result in the best machined surface. However, for the orientation of case E, it easily makes to induce SiC whisker deformation by pulling out or <b>pressing</b> into aluminium <b>matrix,</b> and to produce the worst machined surface...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Victor decided to {{demolish}} their Camden warehouse. This warehouse held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most {{of them were}} pre-tape wax and metal discs), test <b>pressings,</b> lacquer discs, <b>matrix</b> ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. A {{few days before the}} demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon after, collectors and RCA Records officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was demolished, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, when the company decided to release all of Rachmaninoff's recordings on LPs (to celebrate the centennial of the composer's birth), RCA was forced to go to record collectors for materials, as documented by Time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hot {{pressing}} is {{an effective}} way to densify powder compacts, especially during the inclusion of a second phase, such as particles, whiskers or fibers. In the present study, SiC/SiC and C/SiC composites were prepared by hot pressing via liquid phase sintering. Nano-SiC powder was used for matrix formation with sintering additives. The effects of preparation conditions such as sintering temperature, pressure and matrix composition, on the microstructural evolution and mechanical behaviors were discussed. Using micro-SiC powder and nano-SiC powder for matrix formation, the interaction between fiber and matrix was characterized. Because the matrix compositions can be easily modified in the CMC-processing from powders by hot <b>pressing,</b> the SiC-BN <b>matrix</b> was also studied in the present experiment. The inclusion of BN can either improve the machinability or provide oxidation resistance to the composite. BN was derived through an in-situ reaction between boron acid and urea by hot-pressing. Boric acid and urea were solved into the ethanol and mixed with nano-SiC particles, and then infiltrated into the fiber bundles. Correlations among microstructures, properties and compositions will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} {{paper is to}} {{evaluate}} effects of B 4 C addition on the microstructural and thermal properties of hot pressed SiC ceramic matrix composites. Design/methodology/approach: The effect of B 4 C addition on microstructural and thermal properties of the SiC-B 4 C powder composites were investigated after high energy milling and hot pressing. SiC powders containing 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt% B 4 C were mechanically alloyed in a high energy ball mill for 8 h. Findings: Microstructural characterisation investigations (SEM, XRD) were carried out on mechanically alloyed SiC powder composites containing 5 wt %, 10 wt %, 15 wt % B 4 C powders and on these powder composites sintered in vacuum at 50 MPa at 2100 ºC. The thermal properties were characterised using DTA, TGA and dilatometer. The results were evaluated. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the effect of B 4 C addition on microstructural and mechanical properties of the SiC-B 4 C powder composites was investigated after high energy milling and hot <b>pressing.</b> Originality/value: Ceramic <b>matrix</b> composite (CMC) material systems are stimulating {{a lot of interest}} to be used and provide unique properties for aircraft and land-based turbine engines, defence applications, rocket motors, aerospace hot structures and industrial applications. Boron carbide (B 4 C) -silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic composites are very promising armour materials because they are intrinsically very hard. Advanced SiC-based armour is desired so that the projectile is completely defeated without penetrating the ceramic armour...|$|R
