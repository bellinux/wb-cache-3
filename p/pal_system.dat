25|$|More European {{countries}} introduced {{color television}} using the <b>PAL</b> <b>system</b> in the 1970s and early 1980s; examples include Denmark (1970), Belgium (1971), Yugoslavia/Serbia (1971), Spain (1972, but not fully implemented until 1978), Iceland (1973), Portugal (1976, but not fully implemented until 1980), Albania (1981), and Turkey (1981) and Romania (1983, but not fully implemented until 1990). In Italy there were debates {{to adopt a}} national color television system, the ISA, developed by Indesit, but that idea was scrapped. As a result, Italy {{was one of the}} last European countries to officially adopt the <b>PAL</b> <b>system</b> in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Other {{countries}} in the region instead used the <b>PAL</b> <b>system,</b> starting with Australia (1967, but not fully implemented until 1975), and then Thailand (1969; this country converted from a 525-line system to 625 lines), Hong Kong (1970), the People's Republic of China (1971), New Zealand (1973), North Korea (1974), Singapore (1974), Pakistan (1976, but not fully implemented until 1982), Kazakhstan (1978), Vietnam (1978), Malaysia (1978, but not fully implemented until 1980), Indonesia (1979), India (1979, but not fully implemented until 1982), and Bangladesh (1980). South Korea did not introduce color television (using NTSC) until 1980 (full-time color transmissions began in 1981), although it was already manufacturing color television sets for export. Cambodia was the last country in Asia to introduce color television, officially introduced in 1981 using the <b>PAL</b> <b>system,</b> with full-time color transmissions since 1985.|$|E
25|$|The first regular color {{broadcasts}} in Europe were by the United Kingdom's BBC2 {{beginning on}} July 1, 1967 (PAL). West Germany's first broadcast occurred in August (PAL), {{followed by the}} Netherlands in September (PAL), and by France in October (SECAM). Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary all started regular color broadcasts {{before the end of}} 1969. Ireland's national TV station RTÉ began using color in 1968 for recorded programmes; the first outside broadcast made in color for RTÉ Television was when Ireland hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1971. The <b>PAL</b> <b>system</b> spread through most of Western Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Later <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> {{introduced}} alterations {{to ensure}} that Hanover bars do not occur, introducing a [...] "swinging burst" [...] to the color synchronization. Other <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> may handle this problem differently.|$|R
50|$|NTSC is more {{spectrum}} {{efficient than}} PAL, giving more picture detail {{for a given}} bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe still give their <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> the edge in transmitting more picture detail.|$|R

25|$|Hungarian Pál Csernai, who {{had been}} {{assistant}} to Cramer's replacement, Gyula Lorant, became head coach. In his tenure, he revolutionised the style of Bayern by introducing the spatial defence, then in Munich referred to as <b>Pal</b> <b>System.</b> When Paul Breitner returned via Braunschweig from his years with Real Madrid, he formed a partnership with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The FC Breitnigge, reinforced with Belgian goalkeeping legend Jean-Marie Pfaff, Klaus Augenthaler and striker Dieter Hoeneß (brother of Uli), brought success back to Munich. Two championships and a cup resulted from this era. Their dreams of another European Cup were thwarted in the final of Rotterdam against Aston Villa, when {{for a brief moment}} a man named Peter Withe stepped out of obscurity and scored the decider for the team from Birmingham. This was also the first official final that Bayern had lost in its history after 12 undefeated final appearances.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 July 1967, {{during the}} Wimbledon Championships, BBC2 {{became the first}} channel in Europe to begin regular {{broadcasts}} in colour, using the <b>PAL</b> <b>system.</b> The thirteen part series [...] (1969) was created as a celebration of two millennia of western art and culture to showpiece the new colour technology. BBC1 and ITV later joined BBC2 on 625-line UHF band, but continued to simulcast on 405-line VHF until 1985. BBC1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour [...] "unofficially" [...] since September 1969.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the Apple I, Wozniak {{designed}} the Apple II, the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built-in. Inspired by [...] "the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a $1 chip, while colors in the <b>PAL</b> <b>system</b> were achieved by [...] "accident" [...] when a dot occurred on a line, and to this day he has no idea how it works. During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted six. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II {{became one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers.|$|E

50|$|PALs {{are also}} linked {{directly}} or indirectly {{with a number of}} security measures, which together form a comprehensive security package. In general, elements of <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> are located deep within the nuclear device. This makes it almost impossible to bypass the system.|$|R
50|$|The Amiga 1000 has a Motorola 68000 CPU {{running at}} 7.15909 MHz (on NTSC systems) or 7.09379 MHz (<b>PAL</b> <b>systems),</b> {{precisely}} double the video color carrier frequency for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for <b>PAL.</b> The <b>system</b> clock timings {{are derived from}} the video frequency, which simplifies glue logic and allows the Amiga 1000 {{to make do with}} a single crystal. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset DMA so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.|$|R

The list only includes popular formats, not rare formats, and all values are approximate, because the actual quality can vary machine-to-machine or tape-to-tape. For ease-of-comparison, all values are for the NTSC <b>system.</b> (For <b>PAL</b> <b>systems,</b> replace 480 with 576.) Analog formats usually had less chroma resolution.|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{heights and}} cloud types are {{characterized}} from the lidar data observed by two continuously operated portable automated lidar (<b>PAL)</b> <b>systems</b> and {{images from the}} visible and thermal infrared channels of NOAA 16 -AVHRR. The <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> are located in Chiba and Ichihara city areas, separated by approximately 10 km from each other. Measurements from October 2003 to March 2004 reveal that similar cloud structures are observed especially when the wind is along the path connecting the two sites. Slight time lags are frequently observed in the cloud occurrence, {{and they can be}} explained from the wind velocity data in the region. Monthly average of cloud base height (CBH) and cloud cover ratio show good correlation between the two sites. Cloud-type classification using a threshold technique in split window data of NOAA 16 -AVHRR gives results that are found to be consistent with the PAL cloud observations. 1...|$|R

50|$|The PAL-N {{system has}} a {{different}} sound carrier, and also a different colour subcarrier, and decoding on incompatible <b>PAL</b> <b>systems</b> results in a black-and-white image without sound. The PAL-M system {{has a different}} sound carrier and a different colour subcarrier, and does not use 625 lines or 50 frames/second. This would result in no video or audio at all when viewing a European signal.|$|R
2500|$|... 50Hz/60Hz CRTs {{used for}} {{television}} operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734Hz (for NTSC systems) or 15,625Hz (for <b>PAL</b> <b>systems).</b> These frequencies {{are at the}} upper range of human hearing and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT. The sound is due to magnetostriction in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the flyback transformer.|$|R
50|$|Early {{microcomputer}} {{systems such}} as the Commodore 64 and many game consoles (which use televisions as a display device) commonly synchronize the system interrupt timer with the vertical frequency of the local television standard, either 59.94 Hz with NTSC systems, or 50.0 Hz with most <b>PAL</b> <b>systems.</b> Jiffy values for various Linux versions and platforms have typically varied between about 1 ms and 10 ms, with 10 ms reported as an increasingly more common standard in the Jargon File.|$|R

It was designed by Ken Kutaragi and manufactured by Sony.|$|R
50|$|The display {{was highly}} {{customizable}} for the era. The user {{was free to}} create and modify system and user icons, which could be of arbitrary size and design and can have two image states to produce a pseudo-animated effect when selected. Users could customize four display colors and choose from two resolutions: 640×200 or 640×400 (interlaced) on NTSC, or 640×256 or 640×512 on <b>PAL</b> <b>systems.</b> In later revisions, the TV or monitor overscan could be adjusted.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2000 Sony {{issued a}} video {{compilation}} album, Jebediaries, in VHS format for <b>PAL</b> <b>systems,</b> which contained their music videos and concert footage.
