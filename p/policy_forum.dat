40|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>forums</b> are issue-based {{intermediary}} organizations where diverse {{types of}} political and societal actors repeatedly interact. <b>Policy</b> <b>forums</b> are important elements of modern governance systems as they allow actors to learn, negotiate, or build trust. They can vary in composition, size, membership logic, and other distinct features. This article lays {{the foundation of a}} theory of <b>policy</b> <b>forums</b> based on three interrelated elements: First, it discusses conditions for the formation of a forum and describes the logic of these organizations as one of an asymmetric multipartite exchange. Second, it enumerates the potential set of goals and motivations of participating actors that are fed into this exchange. Third, it proposes eight different dimensions on which <b>policy</b> <b>forums</b> differ and which affect the exchange mechanisms among actors. We claim that empirical work on <b>policy</b> <b>forums</b> should systematically take these elements into account and propose elements of a research agenda...|$|R

500|$|In February {{the three}} biggest parties partook {{in a debate}} {{organised}} by the Finnish Business and <b>Policy</b> <b>Forum</b> {{in front of an}} audience consisting of people from the field of business. The National Coalition's Katainen said that as a result of February polling there were now four prime ministerial candidates from the four largest parties. However, the True Finns' chairman and MEP Timo Soini was excluded because the various pollings presented at the time were different. All parties insisted that the retirement age must not be lowered from 63. The SDP's Urpilainen said that the party would continue with what they said was a need to cut pensions and that increasing the retirement age is a form of cutting pensions; to support this she pointed out an earlier retirement age law of 65 years and that the age had been lowered. She also added that because of a large proportion of disabled pensioners, younger people should join the workforce quickly after graduation. Katainen and the Centre Party's Kiviniemi said they would consider raising the retirement age to lengthen work careers. Kiviniemi said that [...] "some of the directors of our large corporations are retiring at the age of 59–60" [...] and that, at the same time, [...] "demands are being presented that people should work longer." [...] Urpilainen also said that lowering the value added tax on food was mistake, though she said that it should not be raised either.|$|E
