Abstract: The {{coasts of}} Campania, show {{more than any}} other region of the Tyrrhenian Sea, an {{articulation}} and a variety of landscapes of exceptional beauty. Yet, despite its own potential, the participation of this region to the national tourist revenue is just over 5 %. The causes of this impasse is to be imputed on lack of planning, during the economic boom, of the tourism development, that has let to small businesses the role of to ensure the provision of services by occasional and fragmented way because of the inability of local governments to protect the territory. What emerges above all is the lack of an unified project from which to derive initiatives, directives and promotion. Particularly now the tourist offer requires targets and coordination with other policies (environmental, territorial, cultural, educational, transport etc.); it miss, ultimately, a strong idea as to support a new offer for regional tourism. In many places the local natural resources have been sacrificed to blind private interests or to match the demands of mass tourism.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} faced by rulers who wanted {{to provide for their}} families, supporters, and friends at a time when principles regulating such gifts were still unfixed; when no clear distinctions had been established between the private and public persons and fortunes of the ruler; when the amount of control the individual ruler could exercise over the property he acquired at his accession had not been determined; when the belief in the ruler's obligation not to alienate the patrjmony of the kingdom was gaining in popularity but had yet to be defined as principle; when royal donations and grants were suffering revocation and cancellation at the hands of later rulers. Focusing on early fourteenth-century France, this paper discusses the experiences of Philip V (1316 - 1322) and particularly the strategies he devised in attempting to insure that grants of property he made to his wife would endure after his death. These strategies were diverse, and included gaining the approval of relatives for the acts and, most remarkably, using elaborate and unusual formulae of validation to warrant the acts. Philip used them for a number of reasons: he and his predecessor Louis X had demonstrated the fragility of the royal will by modifying and revoking a number i ii of royal acts; to increase the kingdom's wealth and elevate his own reputation, Philip had enunciated and enforced principles restricting the king's right and undermining his ability to alienate property; and finally, after early 1317, lacking a male heir, he found himself obliged to provide for a wife and daughters who, after his death, would lack dedicated and enthusiastic support at court. In discussing the fate of Philip V's donations, the article demonstrates the ultimate futility of the king's strategies in the face of his successor's sovereign control of the kingdom's resources, including his ability to use against Philip's heirs the same <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> Philip had used against others. It argues {{that as long as the}} ruler lacked a fixed body of resources to provide for his private needs, as long as these needs lacked clear definition, and as long as he possessed the power to dispense with law and custom, strict <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> could not be expected to be enacted or enforced in France, however great the kingdom's desire for such principles...|$|R
40|$|The rights-based {{approach}} to development targets progress towards {{the realization of}} 30 articles {{set forth in the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Progress is frequently measured using the multidimensional poverty index. While elegant and useful, the multidimensional poverty index is in reality inconsistent with the Universal Declaration <b>of</b> Human Rights <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> indivisibility, <b>inalienability,</b> and equality. We show that a first-order dominance methodology maintains consistency with basic principles, discuss the properties of the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance, and apply the measures to 26 African countries. We conclude that the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance are useful complements that should be employed in tandem...|$|R
40|$|Social {{workers have}} {{proposed}} various conceptual models {{to explain the}} relationship between structural oppressions and poverty. These models are grounded in critical social work and each provides {{an understanding of how}} systemic issues impact the sustenance and reinforcement of poverty. With rapid economic globalization and further social and economic exclusion faced by people, poverty has become even more deep and complex. This paper argues for the adoption of a rights-based framework in social work to address issues of endemic structural poverty. Grounded on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inalienability</b> <b>of</b> basic human rights, the rights-based approach changes the discourse on poverty by creating accountability, equality, transparency and participation from welfare states and civil society. The paper also provides a critique against traditional human rights perspectives in poverty alleviation. The paper provides a context in which the rights-based approach could be pursued in global as well as local contexts...|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Troyes {{threw the}} French in an uncomfortably humiliating position. To accept its terms meant that a {{defeated}} King of France could be coerced {{to hand over}} his kingdom to the enemy. To counter this act, the French developed the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inalienability</b> <b>of</b> the crown. The succession is to be governed {{by the force of}} custom alone, rather than by the will of any person or body. This effectively removed the king's power to relinquish his kingdom, or disinherit the heirs, the princes of the blood. From that moment the succession to the French throne was firmly entrenched in the Capetian lineage. As long as it continued to exist, the Estates cannot elect a new king. By this principle, the French do not consider Henry VI of England as one of their kings. Charles VII of France directly succeeded his father, not his nephew. Curiously, the French kings never asked the English monarchs to drop their nominal claim to France, which they persistently retained until 1800.|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to {{consider}} the double object construction in the light of some data of Kihaya and Sesotho, two Bantu languages in which the objects display symmetrical behaviour with respect to word order, cliticisation, passivisation, unspe-cified object deletion, and raising to subject. In some special circumstances, though, such as those where a relation <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> holds between the two objects, they cease to behave in the same way. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> as an anaphoric relation leads us to expect the existence of asymmetry between the two objects; the word order pat-tems and associated syntactic phenomena encountered in these Bantu languages can be accounted for if a structure such as the one proposed by Larson (1988, 1990) for mul-tiple complementation is assumed. This does not require appeal to a directionality parameter, since word order is derived from the hierarchical structure postulated; thus the theory of binding becomes instrumental in the establishment of structure.

After sketching out what I mean by “natural rights,” “inalienable rights,” and “nonforfeitable rights,” I give some reasons to think any instance of the first would also have to be an instance of the latter two. I then respond to critiques <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> by A. John Simmons and Andrew Jason Cohen. After which, I apply the argument given for why natural rights would have to be inalienable as a reason to think they would also have to be nonforfeitable. Then I respond to the idea that the nonforfeitability of natural rights would conflict with self-defense by outlining an alternate account of self-defense. In closing, I consider some potential implications <b>of</b> the <b>inalienability</b> and nonforfeitability <b>of</b> natural rights, should such natural rights exist...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to find an Ideal Financial Mechanism for the {{development}} of Waqf properties in Malaysia. The problem is that waqf properties are thought to be inalienable because they have to remain as waqf in perpetuity, which make the waqf institutions not to use them as collateral for fear of losing them to the financers and the financers are not willing to accept due to legal constrains arising from the same concept <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> and perpetuity. To achieve its objective, this study proposes to substitute the concept of perpetuity of the physical being of the subject matter of waqf with one that recognizes the perpetuity of dedication, through assigning value to the object of waqf and amortizing it, so that not only various rights can be accepted as the object of waqf but also make the object alienable. This also opens the door for liquid assets (e. g. cash waqf), so that financing development activities would be carried out by the waqf institutions with ease. At the same time, in addition to cash waqf and in spite of the concept <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> <b>of</b> waqf, this study identifies and refines various financial mechanisms, which comprises traditional, and contemporary, including institutional in form of credit based modes, joint ventures, corporate financing such as equities and bonds (securitization) and lastly self-financing through a combination of hikr, istibdal, saham waqf etc. The imperial study indicates that local waqf institutions in Johor, Malacca and Negiri Sembilan still need to catch up with a trend in other Muslim countries. The modes of istibdal, saham waqf and benevolent loans are popular among them. This study, however, finds that none of these is really an ideal financial mechanism for the development of waqf properties with exception of cash waqf...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores Almaty city dwellers’ use of two place-based descriptors—zhailau and ecologically clean—to {{describe}} rurally-sourced {{natural and}} heritage foods in urban Kazakhstan. In contemporary Kazakhstan, as among other industrial and post-industrial societies, ideas surrounding rurally-sourced foods extend beyond questions of urban-industrial hygiene or quality control, and point more powerfully {{to the perceived}} moralities instilled in foods sourced from different places. These places may be concrete geographic locales, or more abstract rural idylls; nevertheless, in either sense, they are felt to imbue food with valuable indigenous nature-cultures otherwise lacking in everyday urban life. Building upon four months of fieldwork in Almaty and surrounding suburbs, I analyze the experiences of individuals living in and strongly identifying with a cosmopolitan hub, yet actively engaged with rural spaces and livelihoods. I argue that zhailau and ecologically clean foods embody a sense <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> and community felt to be missing from commercially produced or imported counterparts, and serve as comestible vehicles of rural, primordial nature-cultures amidst the formative powers of Soviet socialism and contemporary transnationalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{diminishing}} role <b>of</b> <b>inalienability</b> in the Hebrew possessive dative DOI 10. 1515 /cllt- 2015 - 0023 Abstract: Hebrew has two constructions {{that are}} used to convey possessive rela-tions: ordinary possession (OP) and possessive dative (PD). PD is most often used when the possessor is perceived as affected by the action or state described in the sentence. This study investigates the possibility that this tendency is gradually diminishing – in other words, that unaffected possessors in PD {{are in the process of}} becomingmore acceptable. This hypothesis was evaluated in a blog corpus study, which focused on a central correlate of possessor affectedness: whether or not the possessed object was a body part (inalienability). In line with the hypothesis, inalienability had a weaker effect on the choice of construction in younger than in older bloggers. The overall proportion of PD constructions was similar across age groups. This suggests that the change is best viewed as semantic bleaching of PD rather than as a process in which PD is gaining ground at the expense of OP...|$|R
