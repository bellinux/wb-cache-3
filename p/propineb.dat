Female Wistar rats were exposed orally to <b>propineb</b> concentrations of 200 and 400 ppm, from the 6 th day of gestation up to birth. At 400 ppm, <b>propineb</b> showed a variety of macroscopic (e. g. ptosis and paralysis) and microscopic symptoms in the organs of both fetuses and female rats. We found that the body weights of both one-day old litters and their propineb-treated mothers were {{lower than those of}} the controls. Histological examination of the livers and kidneys of the fetuses and propineb-treated pregnant females showed a variety of histopathological effects. The analysis of Zn concentrations (using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry) in the liver, kidney and heart of pregnant females exposed to organometallic fungicide during pregnancy demonstrated that the metal concentrations in these organs were higher than those of the controls. However, the hepatic, renal and myocardial Zn concentrations were greatly increased in the litters subjected to the fungicide during gestation, indicating that high levels of the trace metal in the organs of fetuses may well be due to fungicide easily passing the placental barrier.

40|$|Background: The use of {{pesticides}} is essential to pests control in horticultural crops {{for the production of}} an adequate food supply for an increasing world population and for the control of insect-borne diseases. Therefore, pesticide residues in environment and food {{have a negative impact on}} the health of living organisms especially human. In this regard, the present study was carried out for assessment and comparing of <b>propineb</b> residues in Iranian tea and imported consumed tea. Methods: In this experimental study, according to the Cochran's sample size formula, 12 samples from 4 brand of imported tea and 6 samples from 2 brand of Iranian tea were collected from market basket of Hamadan City in 2015. After preparation and processing the samples in the laboratory, <b>propineb</b> residues in samples determined using a spectrophotometric method to a wavelength range of 400 nm in 5 replications. Recovery tests were carried out using pesticide-free samples. Also, all statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package version 19 (Chicago, IL, USA). Results: The mean concentration of <b>propineb</b> residues in Iranian tea samples were 1. 60 ± 0. 27 µg/kg and in imported tea samples were 0. 78 ± 0. 63 µg/kg, respectively and lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL) provided by the European Commission (100 ppb). The results of the comparison of the mean concentration of pesticide residues between Iranian and imported tea samples revealed no statistically significant differences between all the samples together (P= 0. 17). Conclusion: The results showed that the residues of <b>propineb</b> were found in all analyzed tea specimens.

40|$|Dithiocarbamates {{have emerged}} as potent {{carbonic}} anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in recent years. Given that CAs are important players in cellular metabolism, {{the objective of this}} work was to exploit the CA-inhibitory property of dithiocarbamates as a che-motherapeutic weapon against the Leishmania parasite. We report here strong antileishmanial activity of three hitherto unex-plored metal dithiocarbamates, maneb, zineb, and <b>propineb.</b> They inhibited CA activity in Leishmania major promastigotes at submicromolar concentrations and resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of parasite growth. Treatment with maneb, zineb, and <b>propineb</b> caused morphological deformities of the parasite and Leishmania cell death with 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) values of 0. 56 M, 0. 61 M, and 0. 27 M, respectively. These compounds were evenmore effective against parasites growing in acidic medium, in which their LD 50 values were severalfold lower. Intracellular acidosis leading to apoptotic and necrotic death of L. major promastigotes was found to be the basis of their leishmanicidal activity. Maneb, zineb, and <b>propineb</b> also efficiently re-duced the intracellular parasite burden, suggesting that amastigote forms of the parasite are also susceptible to these metal di-thiocarbamates. Interestingly, mammalian cells were unaffected by these compounds even at concentrations which are several-fold higher than their antileishmanial LD 50 s). Our data thus establish maneb, zineb, and <b>propineb</b> as a new class of antileishmanial compounds having broad therapeutic indices.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} various {{fungicides}} on spore germination, mycelial growth, seed transmission, and infection by Septoria petroselini Desm., the causal agent of Septoria blight of parsley, were determined in this study. Eleven fungicides (azoxystrobin, benomyl, captan, copper oxychloride, kresoxim-methyl mancozeb, maneb, <b>propineb,</b> tebuconazole, thiram, and trifloxystrobin) were tested at various concentrations ranging from 0. 025 to 50 mg l– 1 in spore germination and mycelial growth assays. Tebuconazole {{was the most}} effective fungicide in all the experiments, with an EC 50 value < 0. 052 mg l – 1, followed by azoxystrobin, captan, and trifloxystrobin, with EC 50 values of 0. 053, 0. 06, and 0. 066 mg l – 1, respectively. Many of the fungicides were effective on spore germination in PDA medium at concentrations ranging from 0. 052 mg l– 1 (Tebuconazole) to 23. 032 mg l– 1 (copper oxychloride). Captan, mancozeb, maneb, and thiram were very effective at reducing spore germination, but were less effective at reducing mycelial growth, for which their EC 50 values were up to 735 -, 192 -, 192 -, and 191 -fold higher, respectively. Seed transmission of Septoria blight of parsley was controlled by tebuconazole, benomyl, azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, and captan, which had inhibition rates of up to 95 %, 93 %, 93 %, and 66 %, respectively. Azoxystrobin, benomyl, kresoxim-methyl, trifloxystrobin, and tebuconazole inhibited Septoria blight in vivo, but captan, mancozeb, and maneb were effective at {{reducing the number of}} lesions only when they were applied before inoculation. Copper oxychloride, the most extensively used fungicide for controlling Septoria blight by parsley growers, was surprisingly the least effective in all the experiments...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluid bed}} dryer with inert {{particles}} represents a very attractive alternative to other drying technologies according to the main efficiency criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and speci­fic air consumption. A high drying efficiency results from the large con­tact area and from the large temperature difference between the inlet and outlet air. A rapid mixing of the particles leads to nearly isothermal conditions throughout the bed. A {{fluid bed dryer}} with inert particles was used for drying of slurries. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical column 215 mm in diameter with glass spheres as inert particles. In this paper, results of drying experi­ments with slurries of Zineb fungicide, copper hydroxide, calcium carbo­nate and pure water used as the feed material are presented. In our fluidized bed we successfully dried {{a number of other}} materials such as: fungicides and pesticides (Ziram, <b>Propineb,</b> Mangozeb, copper oxy-chloride, copper oxy-sulphate, Bordeaux mixture), other inorganic compounds (calcium sulphate, cobalt carbonate, electrolytic copper, sodium chloride), and a complex compound (organo-bentonite). The effects of operating conditions on dryer throughput and product quality were investigated. Main performance criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and specific air consumption, were quantified. Temperature profile along the bed was mapped, and nearly isothermal conditions were found due to thorough mixing of the particles. Analysis of drying and energy efficiencies as a function of inlet and outlet air temperature difference was performed for deeper insight in dryer behavior and for optimizing dryer design and operation from an energy point of view. A simple mathematical model based on an overall heat balance predicts the dryer performance quite well. The industrial prototype with fluid bed of 0. 8 m in diameter and capacity 650 kg of evaporated moisture per hour was realized on the basis of presented investigations on pilot unit. The most important results are 50 % decrease in energy consumption and no-additional grinding of dried product in comparison with old tunnel drying technology...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the effect of water quality on the pH value of fungicides, insecticides, mineral {{fertilizers}} and their mixtures. The fungicides <b>propineb</b> (Antracol WP- 70) and mancozeb (Dithane M- 70), insecticides pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic- 50) and imidacloprid(Confidor 200 -SL), several fertilizers (Ferticare I, Ferticare II, Ferticare III and Wuxal Super) and their mixtures were analyzed for pH value under laboratory conditions using a potentiometric pH meter. Measurements were made directly after preparation or mixing with tap and well water and 24 hours later. Tap water exhibited a neutral reaction. A slightly alkaline reaction of well water was mostlikely due to high ammonium content. The suspensions of Antracol WP- 70 exhibited slightly alkaline reactions with both water types during 24 hours. The spray liquids of Dithane M- 70 mixed with tap or well water had neutral reaction after preparation and slightly alkaline reaction after 24 hours. The emulsions of Actellic- 50 showed neutral reaction with both water types, followed by a pH increase in tap water after 24 hours. The solutions of Confidor 200 -SL had a slightly alkaline reaction after mixing and the pH value increased with both water types after 24 hours. It is therefore recommended to apply these insecticides directly after preparation. Mineral fertilizers considerably reduced pH values of the fungicide and insecticide components in double and triple mixtures, especially Ferticare nutrients which had a moderately acid reaction. Wuxal Super had a neutral reaction with both water types. The mixtures with well water increased pH values, which indicates that water pH does affect the pH value of the mixture. Both individual fertilizers and all mixtures (double and triple) with Ferticare had pH values between 2. 4 and 6, which allows their active liquids to be stored for 12 to 24 hours. The suspensions (Antracol WP- 70, double and triple mixtures), emulsions (Actellic- 50 and Actellic- 50 +Wuxal Super) and solutions (Confidor 200 -SL, Wuxal Super and Confidor 200 -SL+Wuxal Super) had pH values between 6. 7 and 7. 9; therefore, the optimum time of their application, especially in case of the mixtures with well water, is immediately after preparation. The suspensions of Dithane M- 70 with the insecticides and Ferticare III showed moderately acid reactions with tap water and slightly acid reactions with well water. Since both individual components and their mixtures showed slightly higher pH values with well water than with tap water, it was an indication that water pH may affect the pHvalue of active liquids...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Agronomía) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería en Agronomía, 2015 The {{following}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{with the objective of}} developing strategies to manage the foliar necrosis of cycas with plan knowledge and the study of the etiology of the disease. The investigation was divided in three stages. In the first stage the various phases of leaf development were determined. These were designated as: Infant (V 1), Formation (V 2), Juvenile (V 3) and Mature (V 4). Furthermore a photographic scale represented 12 phases of these foliar development was designed. In the second stage, it was determined that the causal agent of chasparria was Colletotrichum proteae. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissues and inoculations to healthy plants were made. The disease symptoms were reproduced and the same fungus was isolated from infected tissues of all inoculated plants. Furthermore, the symptoms caused by C. proteae under experimental conditions were similar to those observed for chasparria in commercial farms. The disease presented an incubation period (IP) of three to five days on phases V 1, V 2, V 3 and a latent period (LP) of six days; for phase V 4 the IP was seven days and LP nine days. The leaves that were affected with more severity were those of phases V 2 and V 3. In another experiment the sensitivity in vitro of C. proteae to fungicides (protectant and systemic) was tested. Six concentrations of the active ingredient (0. 01, 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100 ppm) of each fungicide were tested. The active ingredient were categorized as high sensitivity 50 mgL- 1 (clorotalonil, azoxistrobin, boscalid, mancozeb and mancozeb + oxicloruro de Cobre. Protectant fungicides, metiram, <b>propineb</b> and clorotalonil resulted in a highly percent of inhibition of the mycelial development. Prochloraz, difenoconazole and pyrimethanil were the best of the systemic fungicides tested. During the field trials, two experiments with experimental designs that consisted of five blocks and four treatments were conducted. One of them consisted in the evaluation of the rotation of conventional (T 1) and non-conventional fungicides (T 4) and the addition of acetic acid (50 ml L- 1) (T 2 -T 3). It was determined that the conventional treatment is the best to manage chasparria in field conditions. The acetic acid decreased the severity of the disease in the T 2 and T 3 but increase it in T 1 treatment. In the other field experiment of phase three foliar fertilization using (Ca, Mg and Si as a management strategy for chasparria was tested). Results of this experiment indicate that the treatments did not have an effect in the severity of the symptoms of chasparria. To evaluate the severity of the symptoms in the two field experiments, a scale of 0 - 7 (0 =no symptoms and 7 =severe symptoms) was developed and validated {{at the beginning of the}} experiments.

40|$|The entomopathogenic {{muscardine}} fungus, Nomuraea rileyiwas {{isolated from}} local {{population of the}} corn earworm larvae, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), and regarded as an indigenousentomopathogen. Pathological studies were conducted todetermine its inoculation method, storage period, effects oftemperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, culture substrateson its pathogenicity and sporulation. Biocontrol potential of N. rileyi for corn earworm on sweet corn field was also investigated. The spraying method {{is the most effective}} in assaying pathogenicity of this fungus to corn earworm larvae. Mortality has decreased 50 % when the larvae were reared on artificial diet than on natural foodafter the larvae inoculated with fungal spores. There was no reduction inmortality while the larvae were reared on diet without disinfectant within 48 hr after inoculation. The effect of temperature on pathogenicity of N. rileyi to H. armigera was tested by spraying 4 th-instar larvae at aconcentration of 5 x 106 conidia/ml at temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ℃. N. rileyi was more virulent at 20 ℃ than 30 ℃, and with a lowLT 50 value at all tested temperatures. No significant difference wasfound in pathogenicity from 15 to 30 ℃ when the 5 th-instar larvae wereinjected with a dosage of 1, 000 conidia/larva. An assay was conductedwith various temperature alternations between 20 ℃ and otherinoculation temperatures. The proper temperature was ranged from 15 to 30 ℃. However the optimal temperatures for fungal develop-ment indiseased larvae were 20 and 25 ℃. The germination rate at 18 hr aftertreatment was higher at 20 and 25 ℃ than that at 30 and 35 ℃. Higherlevel of conidia germination occurred when they incubated on cuticlewash out than they incubated on SMA+Y medium. The LC 50 values of various instars were determined by using spraying application method. The values of LC 50 decreased withincreasing larval instars. Body surface of larvae is positively correlatedto the instars (r= 0. 99) and the number of conidia fall on the cuticleis also positive related stage (r= 0. 986). The mortality of neonate 4 th-instar larvae were 2. 6 fold hegher than that of larvae at quiescent stage,the present data have indicating that corn earworm larvae could escape fromfungal infection by molting. The 5 th-instar larvae have a longerdevelopmental time and heavy spore loading were more susceptible to infectionthan other instars. The highest larval mortality occurred at 48 hr after incubation under 100 % RH, but no significant difference was found among treatmentsSporulation on cold dried cadavers were ranging from 50 to 100 % RHwith maximal rates between 95 and 100 % RH. The time required forsporulation at 100 % RH was 2 days earlier than at 95 % RH. Mortalities caused by incubating 5 th instar under variousphotoperiod regimes had no significant difference. But the LT 50 valueswere shorter when incubated in the light rather than in the dark. Incubation of cadavers under 24 L and 12 L had a 22 -fold increase inconidial production than under full dark. High humidity and more than 12 hr illumination is then necessary for conidial production on cadavers. Yeast extracts were more effective in conidial germination than other nutrients. Yeast extracts at 0. 1 and 1 % could increase 13. 2 ~ 18. 8 %more larval mortalities than the control, whereas maltose and saccharoseat 0. 01 % had 15. 5 ~ 16. 4 % more than the control. Pig liver as culturesubstract had the highest spore production, i. e. 1. 9 x 109 conidia/g, amongeight solid-state culture materials tested. The pathogenicity of conidiaproduced by various culture materials was assayed with 1 x 106 conidia/mlon 4 th-instar larvae. Job''s tear, mung bean, rice, and pig liver showedhigh larval mortalities. Pig liver is thus recommended as a good andcheaper material for mass production of N. rileyi spores. The 4 th- instar larvae were susceptible, causing 90. 5 ~ 100 % mortalitywhen conidia were applied to 4 crops at 107 conidia/ml. Among them, only application to chrysanthemum leaves resulted in lower mortality thanother crops. The 5 -instar larvae had the highest mortality (94. 6 %) onthe soil with 20 % water content, while lower mortality (41. 7 %) was foundon 10 % water content as sprayed the soil surface with 108 conidia/ml ofthe conidial suspension. Five fungicides, eight insecticides and nine herbicides commonly used in corn fields were evaluated for their inhibition on survival of N. rileyi by the paper disk test. Zineb and <b>propineb</b> showed the highestinhibition of conidial germination than other fungicides. However noinhibitory effect on germination was found in insecticides and herbicidestested except chloropyrifos. Application of N. rileyi conidial suspension to the newly hatchedlarvae had better insecticidal effect than 40. 46 % carbofuran (EC) at 800 fold dilution. In December, the individual corn ear injection by twosaveinterval was better than the spraying as measured the marketable ears anddegree of larval injury. Therefore, it is suggested that N. rileyi has thepotential to be a biocontrol agent for corn earworm. 中文提要: 本地田間自然發生的綠殭菌(Nomuraea rileyi) 已由受感 染的玉米穗夜蛾(Helicoverpa armigera) 幼蟲分離及純粹培養，並在實驗 室內進行接種方法、貯存、溫度效應、齡期感受性、濕度與光週期對產孢 之影響、營養成分對致病及大量產孢等測試及田間應用之評估。所有供試 幼蟲皆經室內馴化二代，並以半合成人工飼料飼養於 25 (1 ℃、 12 小時光照 之恆溫生長箱中，接種感染之供試蟲均為各齡初蛻幼蟲。四種不同的孢子 接種法對四齡幼蟲之致病效果，以體表噴霧法最好。接種後持續餵以人工 飼料比天然食物減少 50 %的死亡率，若接種後 48 小時餵食不含防腐劑之人 工飼料，則不影響罹病死亡率。 在 10 ~ 30 ℃下，以 5 x 106 conidia/ml 噴霧接種四齡幼蟲，罹病死亡率以 20 ℃時最高，其LT 50 亦最短，而以 30 ℃ 時效果最差。若以 1, 000 conidia/larva注射感染五齡幼蟲，其死亡率 在 15 ~ 30 ℃間無顯著差異。但在接種前後進行變溫處理，則適合綠殭菌感 染之溫度為 15 ~ 25 ℃；在蟲體內發病的最適溫度為 20 ~ 25 ℃， 30 ℃以上則不 適合發病。在孢子發芽測試中， 18 小時前的發芽率以 20 及 25 ℃較 30 及 35 ℃ 高，且幼蟲表皮洗出物的發芽率較在SMA+Y培養基上為高。 體表噴霧 接種對不同齡期幼蟲之LC 50 隨齡期之增加而減少(r=- 0. 97) ，且發育齡期 與體表面積呈正相關(r= 0. 99) ，而體表面積與孢子載量呈正相關(r= 0. 914) 。四齡初蛻幼蟲的罹病死亡率比四齡末期高 2. 6 倍，顯示蛻皮為 昆蟲避免真菌病原感染的有效方法。各齡幼蟲之發育期以五齡最長 5. 88 天 ，孢子負載量最大，故五齡幼蟲遠比一、二齡更易罹病。 當接種之後 ，濕度對幼蟲罹病具明顯之影響，但接種後 4 ~ 48 小時以 100 % RH處理， 則 48 小時之死亡率最高，但與其他處理間無顯著差異。而冷藏乾燥之罹病 屍體在 50 ~ 100 % RH中，僅高於 95 % RH才能產孢， 100 % RH比 90 % RH產孢時 間提早 2 日。不同光週期對五齡幼蟲之罹病死亡率無顯著影響，但適當的 光照可使LT 50 提早。光週期對冷藏罹病幼蟲之產孢時間及產孢量有顯著影 響。全暗處理組的產孢量比 24 小時及 12 小時光照低 22 倍，故綠殭菌在寄主 上之產孢及感染需高濕度及 12 小時以上光照條件。 測試含不同成分之 添加物對孢子發芽率，顯示以酵母抽出物效果最好，發芽率隨濃度之增加 而提高。孢子懸浮液中添加 0. 1 及 1 %酵母抽出物對三齡幼蟲之致病力比對 照組高 13. 2 ~ 18. 8 %，添加 0. 01 %的maltose及saccharose可增加 15. 5 ~ 16. 4 % 的幼蟲死亡率。測試 8 種固體培基質對綠殭菌之產孢效果，以豬肝最好， 平均產孢量為 1. 9 x 109 conidia/g。測定 106 conidia/ml在各種基質生產 之孢子懸浮液對四齡幼蟲之致病效果，發現米粒、薏苡、綠豆及豬肝較佳 ，幼蟲死亡率均在 86 %以上，但處理間無顯著差異；因此廉價之豬肝可供 綠殭菌產孢之良好基質。 在四種作物上施用 107 conidia/ml孢子懸浮 液可引起四齡幼蟲 90. 5 ~ 100 %死亡率，其中以菊花葉片較差。土表噴佈孢 子可有效感染五齡幼蟲，土壤含水量在 10 ~ 25 %孢子濃度為 108 conidia/ml 時，對五齡幼蟲的罹病死亡率，以 20 %含水量組達約 95 %最高，而以含水 量 10 %者僅約 42 %最低。採用圓形濾紙法測試田間常用之 5 種殺菌劑、 8 種殺 蟲劑及 9 種殺草劑對綠殭菌孢子生長之抑制，發現在推薦使用濃度下，殺 菌劑以鋅乃浦及甲基鋅乃浦最強，殺蟲劑僅陶斯松有輕微的影響，而殺草 劑均無抑制作用。初齡幼蟲在超甜玉米之田間防治試驗，以綠殭菌的效果 較 40. 46 % 加保扶乳劑稀釋 800 倍為佳，施用方法以注入法比噴霧法好，且 處理組與對照組間差異顯著，由此可知綠殭菌在超甜玉米田對玉封面 目錄 中文摘要 英文摘要 緒言 文獻摘述 第一章、不同接種法及供飼幼蟲食物對綠殭菌感染玉米穗夜蛾之影響 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 第二章、溫度對綠殭菌感染玉米穗夜蛾之影響 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 第三章、綠殭菌對玉米穗夜蛾各齡幼蟲之致病能力 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 第四章、濕度及光週期對綠殭菌產孢及感染玉米穗夜蛾之影響 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 第五章、培養基不同成分對綠殭菌孢子發芽與產孢及其感染玉米穗夜蛾之影響 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 第六章、綠殭菌對玉米穗夜蛾之田間防治評估 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果 討論 附圖及附表 結論 參考文獻 附錄...|$|E
