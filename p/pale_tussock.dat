40|$|During {{the years}} 1988 - 1992 an {{outbreak}} of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> moth, Calliteara pudibunda (L.), took place in northwest Italy (Pied-mont and Liguria) in different sites of beech and mixed broadleaf woods in the western Alps, from 700 to 1, 300 m of height. This outstanding outbreak (the first recorded below the 48 th parallel) was monitored during 1990 - 1993, checking pupal densities and rearing parasitoids. In pupae, ichneumonids reached a maximum parasitization rate of 34 % and tachinids accounted for up to 19 %, whereas in larvae a rather low parasitization rate was equally divided between Diptera (Tachinidae) and Hymenoptera (Ich-neumonidae, Braconidae, Eulophidae). Two cases of hyperparasitization were found of the ichneumonid Goedartia alboguttata (Gravenhorst) by Euceros kiushuensis Uchida in the beechwood of Calizzano in Liguria. Very few cases of oophagous parasitiza-tion by Trichogramma spp. could be detected. Insect, bird and mammal predators were rather ineffective {{on the number of}} larvae, pupae and adults of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> moth. Viral, microbial and fungal agents of larval and pupal mortality were determined. The end of the outbreak was caused by cytoplasmic and nuclear polyhedroses, at least in three of the four investigated areas. The pres-ence of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> moth in the following years was limited to few larvae seen sporadically in the forests and no pupae could be found...|$|E
