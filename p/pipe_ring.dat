40|$|Although the {{majority}} {{length of a}} liner pipe in sliplining rehabilitation is installed without excavation, some portions of the pipe are installed by the open-cut method at locations where connections cannot be made otherwise. The pipe undergoes a sudden change in loading condition, bedding condition and <b>pipe</b> <b>ring</b> composition when it passes through installation pits. A thorough understanding of these changes and how they affect the behaviour and performance of the installed pipe is necessary for effective designs that lead to satisfactory long-term performance. This paper presents an analysis of trenched and trenchless portions of grouted and ungrouted sliplined pipes. Liner pipe materials investigated include HDPE, PVC and reinforced fibreglass. Comparison are made between the trenchless and the trenched portions of the liner pipe in terms of loading, responses to load, effect of bedding and service life. A critical length is defined for the trenched portion in which joints should be avoided, and a practical formula is proposed for determining the critical length.

40|$|The {{stress-strain}} {{response of}} cast iron under tension or compression is nonlinear. This paper examines how the hyperbolic constitutive law {{can be applied to}} characterize nonlinear stress-strain behavior {{of cast iron}} used in water supply networks. Procedures are described to obtain parameters of the hyperbolic constitutive law from either the response (data) obtained from simple uniaxial tensile and compressive tests or from bending tests. To demonstrate its applicability, this hyperbolic constitutive law is first applied to data obtained from uniaxial tensile and compressive tests conducted by Schlick and Moore (1936, Strength and Elastic Properties of Cast Iron in Tension, Compression, Flexure, and Combined Tension and Flexure, Bulletin 127, Iowa Engineering Experiment Station, Ames, IA). In addition, an approach to extract parameters for the hyperbolic constitutive law from bending (beam and <b>pipe</b> <b>rings)</b> tests is proposed and subsequently applied to tests conducted by Talbot (1908, Tests of Cast-Iron and Reinforced Concrete Culvert Pipe, Bulletin No. 22, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). This latter approach is attractive for practical purposes because the test set up is simple and the test coupons are very easy to prepare. The hyperbolic constitutive law in conjunction with maximum normal strain theory as proposed by St. Venant (Collins, J.

40|$|Ring {{instability}} is an impulsive deformation that progresses. At worst, instability is <b>ring</b> collapse. Buried <b>pipes</b> can invert only if {{the ring}} deflects and the soil slips at the same time. Instability of buried pipes is analyzed as a soil-structure interaction. Ring stiffness resists inversion; soil supports the ring to keep it close to circular shape. The present paper demonstrates the basic manners of ring instability for buried flexible <b>pipes,</b> <b>ring</b> deformation and buckling at yield stress. The analysis found that if the pipe is {{to be subjected to}} vacuum {{it is very important to}} limit ring deflection to 5 %. Because it increases the maximum vacuum to be larger than atmospheric pressure, therefore the pipe would not collapse. If the pipe is so flexible ring stiffness cannot be support any of the soil load. With 8 % ring deflection, the vacuum at collapse is,- 0. 55 bar with neglect term, Ed/rn 3, for ring stiffness. For the design of pipes to withstand internal vacuum, a safety factor of 1. 5 is recommended. It is prudent to require that embedment soil be denser than critical. Critical density can be evaluated in the soils laboratory. Even without a water table, percolating water and earth tremors tend to shake loose soil do such that ring deflection could increase and reduce internal vacuum at collapse...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the Solfatara volcano within the Campi Flegrei, a {{volcanic}} field located in the Tyrrhenian coast of the southern Italy. Volcanism at Campi Flegrei caldera has included phreatic to phreatomagmatic explosions, and both magmatic (ranging from small scoria producing events to those with Plinian columns) and effusive eruptions. These eruptions have formed tuff cones, tuff rings, minor scoria cones and lava domes. A detailed stratigraphic, structural and geophysical study of the area indicates that the Solfatara volcano is a maar-diatreme structure previously not recognized within the Campi Flegrei caldera. It {{is characterized by a}} crater cut into earlier volcanic deposits, a small rim of ejecta and a deep structure (down to 2 - 3 km). This maar-diatreme has allowed to the gases and fluids to flow up to the surface over a long time. A new geological map and cross sections show a complex architecture of different volcano-tectonic features including scoria cones, lavas and cryptodomes, feeder dykes, <b>pipes,</b> <b>ring</b> and regional faults, and explosive craters. Volcanological data were collected with the main aim to characterize the eruptive activity in a limited sector of the caldera. Fault and fracture analyses, using the scan line methodology, highlight the role of the main structures that accompanied the volcanic evolution within this sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera. To better constrain the subsurface structure of the Solfatara crater, Electrical Resistivity Tomography investigations were integrated with the volcano-tectonic information. All data suggest that the Solfatara area is dominated by a maar-diatreme evolution. Presently, the Solfatara area shows a widespread hydrothermal and fumarolic activity that is localized along the major faults. The results allow us to define a particular type of volcanic activity in the recent past in the area that is still considered today as one of the areas with a higher probability of opening new vents, particularly for possible phreatic activity...|$|R

In this study, for the evaluation of the hoop properties using the central piece-inserted ring model of Arsene, we performed the ring tensile tests at several temperatures. From the ring tensile tests and numerical analysis the load-displacement conversion relationship of ring specimen (LCRR) was determined.
