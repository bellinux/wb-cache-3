Accordingly, it has been advised to become knowledgeable about schools being applied to, and [...] "tailor each application accordingly." [...] College visits (including overnight ones), interviews, attending College Fair days, comments in the essay, contacting college faculty members, answering and opening emails, <b>place</b> <b>position</b> of the college on the FAFSA form or its FAFSA position, and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their yield—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment. According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, it is important to have numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done. Schools such as Connecticut College and Emory University have been credited as [...] "popularizing the yield game" [...] by refusing well-qualified students who failed to show much real interest in attending, as a way to boost their yield scores. One top high school student was waitlisted at a [...] "likely" [...] college for showing lack of interest: ...|$|E

Your argument could only apply were woman equally with man a wealth producer. As it is, a woman's wealth is invariably the result of a marriage, either her own or that of some shrewd ancestress. And as regards the heiress, the principle of sale and purchase, if I may be forgiven the employment of common terms, is still more religiously enforced. It is not often that the heiress is given away; stolen she may be occasionally, much to the indignation of Lord Chancellors and other guardians of such property; the thief is very properly punished--imprisoned, if need be. If handed over legitimately, her price is strictly exacted, not always in money--that she possesses herself, maybe in sufficiency; it enables her to bargain for other advantages no less serviceable to her children--for title, <b>place,</b> <b>position.</b> In the same way the Neolithic woman, herself of exceptional strength and ferocity, may have been enabled to bestow a thought upon her savage lover's beauty, his prehistoric charm of manner; thus in other directions no less necessary assisting the development of the race." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{infinitely}} {{many ways}} to grasp a spherical object, regularities have been observed in the posture of the arm and the grasp orientation. In the present study, {{we set out to}} determine the factors that predict the grasp orientation and the final joint angles of reach-tograsp movements. Subjects made reach-to-grasp movements toward a sphere to pick it up and place it at an indicated location. We varied the position of the sphere and the starting and <b>placing</b> <b>positions.</b> Multiple regression analysis showed that the sphere’s azimuth from the subject was the best predictor of grasp orientation, although there were also smaller but reliable contributions of distance, starting position, and perhaps even <b>placing</b> <b>position.</b> The sphere’s initial distance from the subject was the best predictor of the final elbow angle and shoulder elevation. A combination of the sphere’s azimuth and distance from the subject was required to predict shoulder angle, trunkhead rotation, and lateral head position. The starting position best predicted the final wrist angle and sagittal head position. We conclude that the final posture of the arm when grasping a sphere to place it elsewhere is determined to a larger extend by the initial position of the object than by effects of starting and <b>placing</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R
