40|$|Mortgage-prepayment risk {{underlies}} the structuring of mortgage-backed derivative securities, such as tranched real estate mortgage investment conduits. This prepayment comes either from mortgage termination or from curtailment, where the borrower retains the existing mortgage and prepays a portion. There are differences <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> {{flows from the}} two types of <b>prepayment.</b> <b>In</b> termination, the loan disappears from a pool, and the scheduled payment to investors in the pool is reduced. In curtailment, the loan survives, and the scheduled payment is unchanged but the term is reduced. There are implications for structuring mortgages and derivative securities. The prepayment decision is embedded in an in-tertemporal household utility maximization framework where choices are made between refinancing, making the regular payment, default or curtailment. Empirical results are presented for Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pools, and an algorithm is presented that separates the termination and curtailment components, facilitating the development of derivative securities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative analysis of prepayment data {{based on the}} historical prepayment experience of two banks in Hong Kong. One of the most distinctive features of mortgages as an asset class is the existence of <b>prepayment</b> risk. Research <b>in</b> <b>prepayment</b> has matured into a coherent body of work that has a sound theoretical framework and consistent empirical validation. Previous research <b>in</b> <b>prepayment</b> has identified certain important causes for prepayment. However, most studies on prepayment were based on fixed-rate mortgages in the USA, while little work on variable-rate mortgages and even less work on <b>prepayment</b> <b>in</b> other countries has been conducted. In this paper, the prepayment pattern of variable-rate mortgages in Hong Kong are examined. Following {{the logic of the}} option-based/optimal model, certain variables have been identified for inclusion in an empirical model on prepayment. As variable-rate mortgages are the custom in Hong Kong, it is considered that {{there will not be a}} refinancing incentive with decreases in interest rates as in the case with fixedrate mortgages. In this study, interest rates are however found to be an important determinant of prepayment, with prepayments sensitive to real interest rates and borrowers sensitive to the prospect of an increase in interest rates. The explanation proposed for this behaviour is consistent with findings in the field of quasi-rational and behavioural economics. It is thus considered fruitful to incorporate concepts from this field into mortgage prepayment research...|$|R

40|$|Like {{any other}} asset, it is {{important}} for investors to value accurately their mortgage portfolio. This valuation will not be precise without available information on the underlying cash flows. To evaluate mortgages properly, they need to have reliable information not only on the scheduled payments, but also on all payments not expected to occur over the duration of the mortgage, either partial prepayments (curtailments) or total <b>prepayments.</b> Currently, <b>in</b> Portugal, the information used is based on international studies. It was not possible to find evidence about Portuguese prepayment studies. The experience of working with mortgages indicated that levels of <b>prepayments</b> referred <b>in</b> most literature (about 6 % of the outstanding principal) would be lower in Portugal. The information about prepayments is relevant to several intervenients in mortgages: financial institutions that lend and need to assess their portfolio; lenders who use scoring systems / pricing and need to incorporate information from expected levels of prepayment; investors in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and rating agencies that evaluate institutions and portfolios. This work involved a first major challenge of getting data (in significant numbers) from the financial institutions about total and partial <b>prepayments</b> <b>in</b> order to have a reliable data base. This information is not easily available and this goal was achieved only with the support of one of the largest credit institutions in the country (which prefers to remain anonymous due to confidentiality reasons). After clarification meetings about the study and its relevance, COO and Administration became interested in the study, approving data delivery. This institution provided prepayments data from the year 2000 until 2012. This allowed us to gather about 747. 000 records of information. Only knowledge about mortgages, about the institution, its database and the extraordinary collaboration of this institution’s staff enabled all data treatment and validation. Historical prepayments and seasoned prepayments were calculated {{as a percentage of the}} total <b>prepayments</b> <b>in</b> each period (month or maturity) over the total mortgage amount. This analysis revealed low levels of prepayment. The average prepayment level of 1, 21 % was well below the usually referred 6 % level. Then, the data was associated with some macro-economic variables (mainly factors referred to in literature) in order to characterize how prepayments were correlated to those indicators. This analysis allowed us to understand which variables were most strongly correlated with prepayments. During the analysis period a Decree-Law (DL) was enacted that limited the level of penalties on prepayments. We assayed the DL’s effect at the <b>prepayments</b> level. <b>In</b> order to get a predictive tool, we regressed prepayments as a function of most significant variables and formulated a predictive model, with a 12 months lag. This model revealed to have a considerable level of significance...|$|R
