40|$|This study {{sought to}} analyze the {{influence}} of knowledge and competence on the adoption of cashless payment systems in Nairobi. If this innovation is not adopted, then there is hindrance to entrepreneurial growth and development. The research used survey research design and the target population was 197 registered <b>Passenger</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Vehicle</b> SACCOS in Nairobi, Kenya. The sample was 99 respondents selected through systematic random sampling by picking every 2 nd manager. The questionnaire was self designed and was used to seek information from the SACCO managers. The SPSS program version 21 was used to aid in organizing and summarizing the data {{by the use of}} descriptive statistics. Regression analysis and correlation were used and there was a positive correlation but the relationship was weak. Given that the pvalue was 0. 358, a conclusion can be made that knowledge and competence of managers is was not significant in adoption of the cashless payment system, hence we don’t reject the null hypothesis. The study recommends that: passengers and the public be educated on benefits of technology adoption, the cashless system to make use of one smart card that can be used across all transport modes and the network system to be improved.

50|$|In the UK, cargo {{carrying}} {{vehicles were}} previously defined, {{and are still}} commonly known, as HGVs (Heavy Goods Vehicles), although for harmonisation with other European Union member states, this term was officially changed to LGV (Large goods vehicle). Articulated lorries are the more common configuration of larger LGV in the UK, where a tractor unit tows a semi-trailer through a fifth wheel coupling. The drawbar configuration is a less common example of large LGV, and consists of a rigid lorry with cargo carrying capacity, which also pulls a second cargo trailer, using a drawbar link. The UK also allows the use of 18 m long 'bendy buses' for public transport. Buses however have their own legal classification, as PSVs (<b>Passenger</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Vehicles).</b>|$|R

40|$|The Last-Mile Problem {{refers to}} the {{provision}} of travel service from the nearest public transportation node to a home or other destination. Last-Mile Transportation System (LMTS), which has recently emerged, provide on-demand shared transportation. We consider an LMTS with multiple passenger types—adults, senior citizens, children, and students. The LMTS designer determines the price for the <b>passengers,</b> last-mile <b>service</b> <b>vehicle</b> capacity, and <b>service</b> fleet size (number of vehicles) for each last-mile region to maximize the social welfare generated by the LMTS. The level of last-mile service (in terms of passenger waiting time) is approximated by using a batch arrival, batch service, multi-server queueing model. The LMTS designer 2 ̆ 7 s optimal decisions and optimal social welfare are obtained by solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Our model is implemented in numerical experiments by using real data from Singapore. We show the optimal annual social welfare gained is large. We also analyze a counterpart LMTS in which the LMTS designer sets an identical price for all passenger types. We find that {{in the absence of}} price discounts for special groups of passengers, social welfare undergoes almost no change, but the consumer surplus of passengers in special groups suffers significantly...|$|R

In August 2006, David MacBrayne Group Ltd., directed two of its subsidiary companies, Cowal Ferries Ltd., and Rathlin Ferries Ltd., to take over operation of the Gourock to Dunoon, and Rathlin to Ballycastle services. Following a European Commission decision to not subsidise a <b>passenger</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>service,</b> the route was again put out to tender.
