In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E

The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E

500|$|Before the war, the {{government}} spent 13 percent of GNP; in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums {{at home and}} abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling unneeded projects. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. [...] There was {{a strong emphasis on}} being [...] "fair" [...] and being [...] "scientific." [...] The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess <b>profits</b> <b>tax,</b> of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. [...] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to [...] 5s (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditures, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.|$|E

40|$|Recovering {{revenue loss}} {{due to the}} {{reduction}} in import tariffs {{is a major concern}} of many developing economies. In an economy with free entry, which affects the product market competition, we show that, even if there is no other tax reform such as a <b>profit</b> <b>tax</b> reform, the market mechanism itself takes care of the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction if entry is sufficiently costly. A compensatory <b>profit</b> <b>tax</b> to compensate the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction is required for an intermediate level of entry cost. If the entry cost is very small, the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction cannot be compensated even with a <b>profit</b> <b>tax</b> reform.
