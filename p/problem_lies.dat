5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> in the fact that every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
25|$|While it {{is widely}} assumed that the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> {{primarily}} in men refusing to grant a get to their wives {{and that it is}} a widespread issue, in Israel, figures released from the chief rabbinate show that women equally refuse to accept a get and that the numbers are a couple of hundred on each side. However, such a husband has the option of seeking a Heter meah rabbanim, while no similar option exists for the wife.|$|E

50|$|In 1938 Margit Kohl-Larsen {{returned}} to Mumba Cave {{in an effort}} to obtain a more complete understanding of the site. Although her work was considered a great triumph in African archaeology at the time, more recent work at the site has illuminated issues from the excavation. Most of the <b>problems</b> <b>lie</b> with the lack of study of the site’s uncovered artifacts, soil samples, and faunal remains. Additional <b>problems</b> <b>lie</b> in that very little information from the site, most of which is now considered unclear, ended up being published by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen in 1943.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} type of reduction used varies and may affect the exact set of problems. If we use NC reductions, that is, reductions which can operate in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors, then all P-complete <b>problems</b> <b>lie</b> outside NC and so cannot be effectively parallelized, under the unproven assumption that NC ≠ P. If we use the weaker log-space reduction, this remains true, but additionally we learn that all P-complete <b>problems</b> <b>lie</b> outside L under the weaker unproven assumption that L ≠ P. In this latter case the set P-complete may be smaller.|$|R
25|$|The print's {{attribution}} is {{a subject}} of some contention. Copies of the print belong to at least 2 public collections: that of the ROM, and that of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. According to its labeling, these institutions disagree on when and by whom it was produced. The <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> mainly {{in the fact that}} the print has no date stamp and is signed Sadamasu ga , a name used by two nineteenth century Osaka print-makers: Sadamasu I and Sadamasu II.|$|E
25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E
25|$|Although the park's terrain {{may appear}} rugged and durable, it is {{extremely}} fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. The <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests {{that are used to}} compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.|$|E

25|$|In Taiwan, {{employers}} {{can also}} be fined if they force Muslim workers to {{come into contact with}} pork. In May 2010, wife of the owner of Shin Hua Hang Fashion Co. in Taipei County was charged for forcing her three Muslim Indonesian employees to eat pork for seven months. She was sentenced to six months in prison for the act. The three workers {{wrote a letter to the}} labor department of the then-Taipei County Government asking for help. This incident triggered a protest from dozens of foreign workers at the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Taipei, led by Taiwan International Workers’ Association (TIWA). This incident led to a condemnation from the Government of Indonesia. Ku Yu-ling, chairperson of TIWA, said that the root of the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> in the government repeatedly delaying including migrant caregivers under the Labor Standards Act to protect their basic working rights.|$|E
25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. People with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them may believe the drugs are sufficient and the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> with the user.|$|E
500|$|According to Marx, capitalists take {{advantage}} of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference [...] "surplus value" [...] and argued that this surplus value had its source in surplus labour, the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce. Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as vampires sucking worker's blood, {{but at the same time}} he notes that drawing profit is [...] "by no means an injustice" [...] and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system. The true <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> with the [...] "cancerous cell" [...] of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.|$|E

500|$|A more {{fundamental}} <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> in the chaotic {{nature of the}} partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. [...] In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, {{and the effects of}} terrain. [...] In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.|$|E
