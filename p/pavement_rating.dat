40|$|These days, {{potholes}} and pavement deterioration make it {{a challenge}} to keep the wheel steady on America's roads and highways. More {{than a quarter of}} the nation's major urban roadways [...] highways and major streets that are the main routes for commuters and commerce [...] are in poor condition. These critical links in the nation's transportation system carry 78 percent of the approximately 2 trillion miles driven annually in urban America. With state and local governments unable to adequately fund road repairs and with the current federal surface transportation program set to expire on September 30, 2014, road conditions could get even worse in the future. In this report, TRIP examines the condition of the nation's major urban roads, including pavement condition data for America's most populous urban areas, recent trends in travel, the latest developments in repairing roads and building them to last longer, and the funding levels needed to adequately address America's deteriorated roadways. For the purposes of this report, an urban area includes the major city in a region and its neighboring or surrounding suburban areas. Pavement condition data are the latest available and are derived from the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) 2011 annual survey of state transportation officials on the condition of major state and locally maintained roads and highways, based on a uniform <b>pavement</b> <b>rating</b> index. The <b>pavement</b> <b>rating</b> index measures the level of smoothness of pavement surfaces, supplying information on the ride quality provided by road and highway surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Being {{functioned as}} the main {{transportation}} line for passengers and cargo, any distress on the pavement of South Ring Road in Yogyakarta requires rehabilitation to prevent severe condition. But before the rehabilitation is carried out, it is required to evaluate the road pavement condition. The objective {{of this study is}} to appraise or to value the road pavement condition. This research implementation was visually completed by using Pavement Condition Index Method. It was started by dividing the road into several research units in 100 x 3. 5 m by size for each unit sample. Then, each of the research unit was observed and measured to identify the distress type and severity level in order to obtain PCI rating value of the pavement. Result of the study showed that the distress types included the alligator cracking, block cracking, depression, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching, polished aggregate, shoving, slippage cracking and weathering/graveling. The prevailing ones were block cracking and alligator cracking. The damages occurred only on some parts of the segment. Therefore, it was better to adjust the treatment for such damage for the distress type. Treatment priorities should be given to sample unit 23 B (lane 1) due to its smallest PCI value, which was 22, with VERY POOR condition <b>pavement</b> <b>rating...</b>|$|E
40|$|Every agency {{responsible}} {{for the maintenance of}} roadway systems faces the problem of insufficient funding to perform all of the necessary repairs on pavement sections. Therefore, highway agencies must adopt a pavement management system (PMS) to help set priorities. The PMS includes a method for evaluating pavement performance on a routine basis and identifying sections with a need for rehabilitation or maintenance. Some states in the U. S. use a <b>pavement</b> <b>rating</b> system that is based solely on visible surface distresses, while others use an index based on ride quality alone to perform the regular evaluation of pavements and to select projects. Increasingly, many states are using a combination of distress and ride quality. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) utilizes the Pavement Condition Rating (PCR), based on surface distress, for project selection. This paper outlines {{the development of a new}} performance index for pavements that incorporates aspects of ride quality together with surface distress for possible adoption by ODOT. The proposed index is called the Pavement Quality Index (PQI). The PQI does not require any new measurements or methods; rather, it simply utilizes procedures that are already in place and well established in Ohio. The PQI is an amalgam of the PCR and the International Roughness Index (IRI). The development of the new index is the natural extension of the growing trend that transportation agencies are placing increased emphasis on customer satisfaction, and also introducing performance-based specifications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Pavement</b> {{deterioration}} <b>rate</b> is {{very difficult}} to predict because of the complexities in determining the <b>pavement</b> condition <b>rating</b> or difficulty in collecting detailed data, particularly in absence of sophisticated equipment or trained staff etc. A wide variety of Pavement Maintenance Systems (PMS) are used, but unfortunately either these systems do not use a formalized procedure to determine the <b>pavement</b> condition <b>rating</b> or they assign the pavement state transition probabilities on the basis of experience. The object {{of this paper is to}} apply the Markovian probability process of operational research to develop a decision support system (DSS) to predict the future condition of the pavement. Significance of the collected sample data of 20 pavement sections is first tested for Markovian properties. Χ-inference test is used to check the goodness of fit. Poisson‘s method is used for calculating successive transition matrices for predicting future condition state of pavements. The results support the Markovian probabilistic process tool for finding the future condition states of pavements at any particular year.

40|$|Transportation (ADOT) is {{responsible}} for the funding of assistance for pavement projects at 56 primary airports throughout the state. In 1991 the department began the de-velopment of a network-level pavement management system. The development of the system, its functional parts, and the implementation of the system within the department are de-scribed. The development of the system included the mar-riage of existing Macintosh computer software for land use capability and noise studies for the airports with new software dealing with pavement deterioration and repair. The unique side of the development process was the need to formulate a system that could be used by all members of the Aeronautics Division during yearly 5010 safety inspections and produce meaningful prediction of pavement service life, rehabilitation requirements, and prioritization of pavement projects across the state. The Arizona <b>Pavement</b> <b>Rating</b> system uses a new pave-ment distress rating procedure to evaluate pavement con-dition. The system is based on experienced gained from pavement evaluations that use pavement condition index procedures, hut the system is not as labor-intensive and does not produce as much quantitative information. The develop-ment of this process is described, and its relationships to pavement condition index procedures are shown. The system calculates remaining service life and generates a prioritized project listing for each airport. The resultant project costs are combined into a statewide fiscal plan for funding requests. Software development and structure are described as are the links to the existing land use noise and 5010 data base sok-ware. The computer system and data base were installed in November 1992.

40|$|An {{aircraft}} <b>pavement</b> strength <b>rating</b> {{system has}} been internationally adopted since 1981. Since that time, aircraft tyre pressures and wheel loads have increased significantly {{and an increase in}} shear-related surface distress has been reported. The current strength rating system focuses on protection of the subgrade. It also includes a tyre pressure limit intended to protect stress-susceptible surfaces. However, the shear stresses in the surface layer {{have been shown to be}} a function of both the tyre pressure and the individual wheel load. A modification to the current aircraft <b>pavement</b> strength <b>rating</b> system is recommended. The proposed modification replaces the current tyre pressure rating with a classification number that reflects the contribution of both tyre pressure and wheel load to surface layer shear stress. Guidance is also provided on the selection of a surface rating and the granting of approval for usage by aircraft with more demanding wheel load and tyre pressure combinations. It is also recommended that efforts to include shear-related surface failure modes into routine pavement design tools be given high priority, as this will allow a more rational approach to surface rating selection. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R
40|$|Performance-based {{maintenance}} contracts {{differ significantly}} from material and method-based contracts that have been traditionally used to maintain roads. Road agencies {{around the world have}} moved towards a performance-based contract approach because it offers several advantages like cost saving, better budgeting certainty, better customer satisfaction with better road services and conditions. Payments for the maintenance of road are explicitly linked to the contractor successfully meeting certain clearly defined minimum performance indicators in these contracts. Quantitative evaluation of the cost of performance-based contracts has several difficulties due to the complexity of the pavement deterioration process. Based on a probabilistic analysis of failures of achieving multiple performance criteria over the length of the contract period, an effort has been made to develop a model that is capable of estimating the cost of these performance-based contracts. One of the essential functions of such model is to predict performance of the pavement as accurately as possible. Prediction of future degradation of pavement is done using Markov Chain Process, which requires estimating transition probabilities from previous deterioration <b>rate</b> for similar <b>pavements.</b> Transition probabilities were derived using historical <b>pavement</b> condition <b>rating</b> data, both for predicting pavement deterioration when there is no maintenance, and for predicting pavement improvement when maintenance activities are performed. ^ A methodological framework has been developed to estimate the cost of maintaining road based on multiple performance criteria such as crack, rut and, roughness. The application of the developed model has been demonstrated via a real case study of Miami Dade Expressways (MDX) using <b>pavement</b> condition <b>rating</b> data from Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for a typical performance-based asphalt pavement maintenance contract. Results indicated that the pavement performance model developed could predict the pavement deterioration quite accurately. Sensitivity analysis performed shows that the model is very responsive to even slight changes in <b>pavement</b> deterioration <b>rate</b> and performance constraints.

40|$|A <b>pavement</b> {{strength}} <b>rating</b> {{system is}} internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft tyre pressures. In 2008, increases in the tyre pressure limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of tyre pressure and individual wheel load increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. Tyre pressure and wheel load combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both tyre pressure and wheel load. The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with wheel load but was insensitive (< 1 %) to tyre pressure changes. The ability of the current aircraft <b>pavement</b> strength <b>rating</b> system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the tyre pressure rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both tyre pressure rating and individual wheel load. It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Although {{the impact}} of road {{pavement}} surface condition on rolling resistance has {{been included in the}} life cycle assessment (LCA) framework of several studies in the last years, there is still a high level of uncertainty concerning the methodological assumptions and the parameters that can affect the results. In order to adopt pavement carbon footprint/LCA as a decision-making tool, it is necessary to explore {{the impact of}} the chosen methods and assumptions on the LCA results. Methods This paper provides a review of the main models describing the impact of the pavement surface properties on vehicle fuel consumption and analyses the influence of the methodological assumptions related to the rolling resistance on the LCA results. It compares the CO 2 emissions, calculated with two different rolling resistance models existing in literature, and performs a sensitivity test on some specific input variables (<b>pavement</b> deterioration <b>rate,</b> traffic growth, and emission factors/fuel efficiency improvement). Results and discussion The model used to calculate the impact of the pavement surface condition on fuel consumption significantly affects the LCA results. The <b>pavement</b> deterioration <b>rate</b> influences the calculation in both models, while traffic growth and fuel efficiency improvement have a limited impact on the vehicle CO 2 emissions resulting from the pavement condition contribution to rolling resistance. Conclusions and recommendations Existing models linking pavement condition to rolling resistance and hence vehicle emissions are not broadly applicable to the use phase of road pavement LCA and further research is necessary before a widely-used methodology can be defined. The methods of modelling and the methodological assumptions need to be transparent in the analysis {{of the impact of the}} pavement surface condition on fuel consumption, in order to be interpreted by decision makers and implemented in an LCA framework.

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{establishing}} a pavement management system (PMS) is road network identification.

In this study, a <b>pavement</b> distress condition <b>rating</b> procedure was used to achieve the objectives of this study. The main objectives of this study were to identify the common types of distress that exist on the Jazan road network (JRN), either on main roads or secondary roads, and to evaluate the pavement condition based on network level inspection. The study was conducted by collecting pavement distress types from 227 sample units on main roads and 500 sample units from secondary roads. Data were examined through analysis of common types of distress identified in both main and secondary roads. Through these data, pavement condition index (PCI) for each sample unit was then calculated. Through these calculations, average PCIs for the main and secondary roads were determined. Results indicated that the most common pavement distress types on main roads were patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, polished aggregate, weathering and raveling, and alligator cracking. The most common pavement distress types on secondary roads were weathering and raveling, patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, potholes, and alligator cracking.

The deployed approach applies a two-stage solution to the three popular design methods of flexible pavement to yield pavement designs using stage load applications values specified for each investigated design load applications level. The resulting two-stage pavement designs are then used to obtain an indicator called the stage design strength ratio (percentage) defined as {{the ratio of the}} relative strength change to the design relative strength. The relative strength change is the difference between the design relative strength associated with a design load applications level and stage relative strength associated with a stage load applications value that is {{less than or equal to}} the design load applications level. It basically provides a measure of strength difference resulting from two pavement designs obtained using two distinct loading conditions. Then, the derived values of stage design strength ratio are compared to the deployed stage load applications values.|$|R

This paper investigates the long-term benefits of microsurfacing applications at various highway sections in Indiana. The measures of effectiveness (MOE) used are treatment life, increase in average condition, and area bounded by the treatment performance curve. Each MOE was expressed separately in terms of three performance indicators – surface roughness (IRI), <b>Pavement</b> Condition <b>Rating</b> (PCR), and Rutting (RUT). The results show that for each MOE and performance indicator, the treatment effectiveness is influenced by climate, traffic loading, and highway class. The results also show that the effectiveness of microsurfacing is most perceptible when rutting is used as the performance indicator. When treatment service life is used as the MOE, microsurfacing effectiveness ranges from 2 – 10 years (on the basis of the IRI performance indicator); at least 15 years (on the basis of rutting); and 4 – 15 years (on the basis of PCR).

A recent study [16] has investigated the local streets and roads in California and found based on the data that came from recognized pavement management systems that the statewide average pavement condition is deteriorating at a rate that is causing the California’s local streets and roads system to reach a point of crisis. While inadequate design strength can contribute to the accelerated deterioration of pavements, other location related factors can also {{have a significant impact on}} pavement deterioration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, <b>pavement</b> rutting <b>rate</b> has {{increased}} significantly due to constant traffic intensity increment. These solicitations affect the bituminous layers that can quickly attain their permanent deformation limit resistance. This phenomenon {{can lead to}} a pavement depression, located in the tyre-road contact surface. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a methodology to estimate the rutting of bituminous pavements and to predict the rutting risk considering the bituminous mix rutting resistance characteristics obtained with the LPC traffic simulator, and taking into account the traffic and environmental characteristics. The traffic characteristics are represented by the total heavy traffic expressed in equivalent single axle loads (ESAL) passed on the pavement during the service period, and the heavy vehicles speed on the considered section. The environmental characteristic is represented by the pavement temperature at 2 cm depth. The developed model starts from the widely used empirical rutting formula and its experimentally determined coefficients. The general concept of the model is to start from this generalised rutting formula and to apply it to the real rutting behaviour occurring in pavements. For this purpose, observations and material analysis of eleven in place pavements were made. The model was calibrated using eleven bituminous mixes and verified introducing the characteristics of four in place bituminous mixes not considered in the initial calibration phase. The developed model gives rut depth values after having determined material and site characteristics and presents a good correlation coefficient with very satisfactory results in its verification phase with additional materials...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} evidence that the earth’s climate is changing {{with some of the}} changes attributable to transport infrastructure. Climate change can have impacts on road infrastructure. The direct impacts can be due to the effects of environment. Temperature can affect the aging of bitumen resulting in an increase in brittle failure of the surface seals that represent more than 90 % of the rural sealed roads in Australia. Further, rainfall changes can alter moisture balances and influence pavement deterioration. Brittle failure of the bitumen causes the surface to crack, with a consequent loss of waterproofing of the surface seal. The result is that surface water will enter the pavement causing potholing and will cause rapid loss of surface condition. More frequent reseal treatments will overcome the problem, but this is at a higher cost to road agencies. Road infrastructure is a long-lived investment. An understanding of the expected impacts of future climate change by road designers, asset managers and planners, could produce considerable cost savings in the long term. This research aims to provide an assessment of likely effects on climate change for South East Queensland region in the next 90 years, and further identify and assess the likely effects of climate change on road pavement. It can be concluded that, climate change in South East Queensland does play a role in lower deterioration rates. The findings suggest that decreasing rainfall (decreasing TMI) will slow flexible pavement deterioration. However, increases in temperature are likely to cause materials to expand to affect <b>pavement</b> deterioration <b>rates.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|The report compares and {{contrasts}} {{the automated}} PASCO method of pavement evaluation to the manual procedures {{used by the}} Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) to evaluate pavement condition. Iowa DOT's use of IJK and BPR roadmeters and manual crack and patch surveys are compared to PASCO's use of 35 -mm photography, artificial lighting and hairline projection, tracking wheels and lasers to measure ride, cracking and patching, rut depths, and roughness. The Iowa DOT method provides a Present Serviceability Index (PSI) value and PASCO provides a Maintenance Control Index (MCI). Seven sections of Interstate Highway, county roads and city streets, and one shoulder section were tested with different speeds of data collection, surface types and textures, and stop and start conditions. High correlation of results between the two methods in the measurement of roughness (0. 93 for the tracking wheel and 0. 84 for the laser method) were recorded. Rut depth correlations of 0. 61 and cracking of 0. 32 are attributed to PASCO's more comprehensive measurement techniques. A cost {{analysis of the data}} provided by both systems indicates that PASCO is capable of providing a comparable result with improved accuracy at a cost of 125 - 150 or less per two-lane mile depending on survey mileage. Improved data collection speed, accuracy, and reliability, and a visible record of pavement condition for comparable costs are available. The PASCO system's ability to provide the data required in the Highway Pavement Distress Identification Manual, the <b>Pavement</b> Condition <b>Rating</b> Guide, and the Strategic Highway Research Program Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Studies, is also outlined in the report...|$|R
