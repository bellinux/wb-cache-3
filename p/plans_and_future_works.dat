40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the capabilities and limitations of some current models being applied to the analysis of waste transfers; identifies the modeling capabilities needed {{to reduce the risk of}} pipeline plugging during tank waste transfers; <b>and</b> summarizes ongoing, <b>planned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> <b>work</b> needed to add these capabilities. Development of improved waste transport modeling tools with these capabilities will also help with waste transfer <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> evaluation, process control, and diagnosis of plugging events. Other potential applications include evaluation of waste-mixing scenarios, analysis of waste transfer stability, analysis of waste-unplugging alternatives, minimization of water addition, maximization of system availability, evaluation of risk-reduction strategies, and evaluation of cost-reduction strategies...|$|R

40|$|GNUnet is an {{alternative}} network stack for building secure, decentralized and privacy-preserving distributed applications. Our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet protocol stack. Starting from an application for secure publication of files, it has grown to include all kinds of basic protocol components and applications towards {{the creation of a}} GNU internet. This habilitation provides an overview of the GNUnet architecture, including the development process, the network architecture and the software architecture. The goal of Part 1 is to provide an overview of how the various parts of the project work together today, and to then give ideas for future directions. The text is a first attempt to provide this kind of synthesis, and in return does not go into extensive technical depth on any particular topic. Part 2 then gives selected technical details based on eight publications covering many of the core components. This is a harsh selection; on the GNUnet website there are more than 50 published research papers and theses related to GNUnet, providing extensive and in-depth documentation. Finally, Part 3 gives an overview of current <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R
40|$|For several decades, American manned spaceflight {{vehicles}} {{and the associated}} launch platforms have been transported from final assembly to the launch pad via a pre-launch phase called rollout. The rollout environment is rich with forced harmonics and higher order effects {{can be used for}} extracting structural dynamics information. To enable this utilization, processing tools are needed to move from measured and analytical data to dynamic metrics such as transfer functions, mode shapes, modal frequencies, and damping. This paper covers the range of systems and tests that are available to estimate rollout forcing functions for the Space Launch System (SLS). The specific information covered in this paper includes: the different definitions of rollout forcing functions; the operational and developmental data sets that are available; the suite of analytical processes that are currently in-place or in-development; <b>and</b> the <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> <b>work</b> underway to solve two immediate problems related to rollout forcing functions. Problem 1 involves estimating enforced accelerations to drive finite element models for developing design requirements for the SLS class of launch vehicles.

40|$|Abstract — Reliability of a {{software}} system, {{or the lack}} of it, is often reflected in user satisfaction. Software development organizations frequently need to reallocate resources amongst projects to help satisfy user needs better. In this paper, we propose the project-entropy metric to understand the dynamics of such resource allocation across projects.
