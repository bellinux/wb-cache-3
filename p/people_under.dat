5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in <b>people</b> <b>under</b> 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among <b>people</b> <b>under</b> 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in <b>people</b> <b>under</b> 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young <b>people</b> <b>under</b> their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply <b>people</b> <b>under</b> the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the <b>people</b> <b>under</b> his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the <b>people</b> <b>under</b> normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around the dictator figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} <b>people</b> <b>under</b> his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to <b>people</b> <b>under</b> 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E
