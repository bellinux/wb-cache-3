Regulation 472/2013: On the {{strengthening}} of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties {{with respect to their}} financial stability.Eurozone member states with an ongoing EIP, or being involved in a financial assistance program from EFSM/EFSF/ESM/IMF/other bilateral basis, will be required to further increase the level and frequency for submitted monitor/surveillance reports to the European Commission. This so-called [...] "enhanced surveillance" [...] will mean, that [...] "status reports for corrective action" [...] needs to be published on a quarterly basis, and that the Commission on that basis will be allowed to send warnings to the national parliament of the member state concerned, about a likely missed compliance with programme targets and/or the fiscal adjustment path to comply with EDP deadlines, at such an early stage in the process, that the affected member state still have sufficient time to implement needed counter-measures to prevent the possible delay of the required compliance. Regulation 472/2013 will continue to apply for member states recently having ended a macroeconomic financial assistance programme, with a <b>post-programme</b> <b>surveillance</b> being active until at least the time when more than 25% of the borrowed money has been repaid. In the event of a [...] "persistent risk to the financial stability or fiscal sustainability of the Member State concerned", the Council may also decide to further extend the duration of the <b>post-programme</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Finally it shall be noted, that regulation 472/2013 will not apply for a member state without an open EIP receiving macroeconomic financial assistance only {{in the form of an}} undrawn [...] "Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line".|$|E
