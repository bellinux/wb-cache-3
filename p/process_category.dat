40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Rapid Prototyping Journal and the definitive published version is available at [URL] – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effect of the main process parameters of Laser Melting (LM) type Additive Manufacturing (AM) on multi layered structures manufactured from JSC- 1 A Lunar regolith (Moondust) simulant powder. Design/methodology/approach – Laser diffraction technology was used to analyse and confirm the simulant powder material particle sizes and distribution. Geometrical shapes were then manufactured on a Realizer SLM™ 100 using the simulant powder. The laser-processed samples were analysed via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate surface and internal morphologies, Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to analyse the chemical composition after processing and the samples were mechanically investigated via Vickers micro-hardness testing. Findings – A combination of process parameters resulting in an energy density value of 1. 011 J/mm 2 allowed the successful production of components directly from Lunar regolith simulant. An internal relative porosity of 40. 8 %, material hardness of 670 ± 11 HV and a dimensional accuracy of 99. 8 % were observed in the fabricated samples. Originality/value – This research paper is investigating the novel application of a Powder Bed Fusion AM <b>process</b> <b>category</b> as a potential on-site manufacturing approach for manufacturing structures/components out of Lunar regolith (Moondust).

40|$|To {{understand}} fully cell behaviour, biologists {{are making}} progress towards cataloguing the functional elements in the human genome and characterising their roles {{across a variety of}} tissues and conditions. Yet, functional information – either experimentally validated or computationally inferred by similarity – remains completely missing for approximately 30 % of human proteins. FFPred was initially developed to bridge this gap by targeting sequences with distant or no homologues of known function and by exploiting clear patterns of intrinsic disorder associated with particular molecular activities and biological processes. Here, we present an updated and improved version, which builds on larger datasets of protein sequences and annotations, and uses updated component feature predictors as well as revised training procedures. FFPred 2. 0 includes support vector regression models for the prediction of 442 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which largely expand the coverage of the ontology and of the biological <b>process</b> <b>category</b> in particular. The GO term list mainly revolves around macromolecular interactions and their role in regulatory, signalling, developmental and metabolic processes. Benchmarking experiments on newly annotated proteins show that FFPred 2. 0 provides more accurate functional assignments than its predecessor and the ProtFun server do; also, its assignments can complement information obtained using BLAST-based transfer of annotations, improving especially prediction in the biological <b>process</b> <b>category.</b> Furthermore, FFPred 2. 0 can be used to annotate proteins belonging to several eukaryotic organisms with a limited decrease in prediction quality.

Responsibility for the security of Category I special nuclear material is divided between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Specifically, DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within DOE, are responsible for overseeing physical security at government-owned and contractor-operated sites with Category I special nuclear material. NRC, which is responsible for licensing and overseeing commercially owned facilities with nuclear materials, such as nuclear power plants, is responsible for regulating physical security at those licensees that store and <b>process</b> <b>Category</b> I special nuclear material under contract, primarily for DOE. Because of the risks associated with Category I special nuclear material, both DOE and NRC recognize that effective security programs are essential. The key component in both DOE's and NRC's security programs is each agency's design basis threat (DBT) [...] classified documents that identify the potential size and capabilities of terrorist threats to special nuclear material. To counter the threat contained in their respective DBTs, both DOE sites and NRC licensees use physical security systems, such as alarms, fences, and other barriers; trained and armed security forces; and operational security procedures, such as a "two-person" rule that prevents unobserved access to special nuclear material. In addition, to ensure DBT requirements are being met and to detect potential security vulnerabilities, DOE and NRC employ a variety of other measures, including inspection programs; reviews; and force-on-force performance tests, in which the site's security forces undergo simulated attacks by a group of mock terrorists. Over the past several years, we have raised concerns about certain aspects of security at DOE sites and at NRC-regulated commercial nuclear power plants. In this context, you asked us to determine (1) whether DOE's and NRC's requirements for protecting Category I special nuclear material from terrorist threats differ from one another; (2) the reasons for any differences between these requirements; and (3) if, as a result, there are differences between how NRC-licensed facilities that store and <b>process</b> <b>Category</b> I special nuclear material and how DOE facilities that store and <b>process</b> <b>Category</b> I special nuclear material are defended against a terrorist attack. ...|$|E

30|$|Given {{that the}} {{processes}} that denote action in {{either of the two}} aforementioned Transitivity systems include actions that imply intention as well as a lack thereof (i.e. bodily reactions), {{there seems to be no}} reason why a separate category is actually needed to represent many of the physiological and psychological behaviours. To add to this, the idea of differentiating between an agentive and a non-agentive Senser for the mental perception process set is also a useful way of accounting for a number of verbs that denote deliberate as opposed to non-deliberate perception (i.e. look at vs. see, for instance). With the latter in mind, then, the behavioural <b>process</b> <b>category</b> appears to be superfluous and, therefore, could, in fact, be eliminated altogether from the Transitivity network.

In the current study, gene expression levels from five platforms were integrated to yield a single composite transcriptome profile.
