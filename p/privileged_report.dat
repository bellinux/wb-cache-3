40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the meanings that {{residents of the}} township of Hooggenoeg (in Grahamstown, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa) made of the election coverage in the Grocott’s Mail newspaper during 2011 municipal elections in South Africa. In addition, this study also sought to understand the particular set of ‘normative roles’ played by the paper, both {{with reference to the}} well-established body of theory about the normative roles of journalism in a democracy, {{and in terms of the}} paper’s own conceptualisation of its role in the functioning of local democracy. Grocott’s Mail, the oldest independent newspaper in South Africa, provided extensive pre-election coverage, which included producing and distributing an unprecedented free edition of the paper. The paper also facilitated a town hall debate in order to encourage residents to vote, and empower them to make a more informed choice about their vote. Three qualitative research methods, namely qualitative content analysis, focus group interviews, and individual interviews were used to examine the relationship between the content provided by the paper and the audience’s process of ‘making sense’ and deriving meaning from the content provided. The study concludes that Grocott’s attempt to encourage democratic culture in Grahamstown, in keeping with the more ‘facilitative’ normative roles that the local media can play, was only partially successful. Much of the election reporting subordinated the voices of the ordinary people, and <b>privileged</b> <b>reporting</b> that focussed narrowly on the voting process, and which foregrounded the views of political parties. Overall this coverage largely failed to resonate with the Grocott’s readers who live in Hooggenoeg (a largely ‘coloured’ area of Grahamstown), whose key concerns in terms of their daily life – such as poverty, unemployment, crime, lack of services – seemed, to them, unaddressed by this election coverage and, consequently, was not as engaging or convincing as the publishers/editors had hoped it would be. It can be also argued that Grocott’s narrow conceptualisation of democracy as entailing only public participation in electoral processes failed to cater for how audiences can be made aware of how they can participate in governance beyond the election period...|$|R
30|$|Prior to analysis, we {{acquired}} the CSR reports {{for each of}} the two data sets. This was not possible for one of the focal firms – Magna International – who did not have a sustainability report. For the remaining firms, we downloaded their most recent CSR reports – typically, but not always, 2016 publications. In the case of firms that produced multiple reports on a variety of responsible management-related topics, we <b>privileged</b> CSR <b>reports</b> over other forms of reporting, such as environmental, social, and governance reports and public accountability statements. From each report, we then extracted the letter from the CEO, Chair, or senior CSR thought leader for the firm. In some cases, CEOs and board chairs co-published a letter; in other cases, these were separate letters to stakeholders. In cases of multiple letters, all letters were included in the analysis, because when combined, they represent the most direct and holistic statements of the firm concerning their views on corporate social responsibility. In the case of integrated reporting, where the CSR report is integrated within the annual report – an emerging best practice (Sierra-García et al. 2015; IIRC 2017) – we included the letter to stakeholders.|$|R

40|$|We {{experience}} the world serially rather than simultaneously. A century {{of research on}} human and nonhuman animals {{has suggested that the}} first experience in a series of two or more is cognitively <b>privileged.</b> We <b>report</b> three experiments designed to test the effect of first position on implicit preference and choice using targets that range from individual humans and social groups to consumer goods. Experiment 1 demonstrated an implicit preference to buy goods from the first salesperson encountered and to join teams encountered first, even when the difference in encounter is mere seconds. In Experiment 2 the first of two consumer items presented in quick succession was more likely to be chosen. In Experiment 3 an alternative hypothesis that first position merely accentuates the valence of options was ruled out by demonstrating that first position enhances preference for the first even when it is evaluatively negative in meaning (a criminal). Together, these experiments demonstrate a "first is best" effect and we offer possible interpretations based on evolutionary mechanisms of this "bound" on rational behavior and suggest that automaticity of judgment may be a helpful principle in clarifying previous inconsistencies in the empirical record on the effects of order on preference and choice...|$|R
40|$|What {{has been}} the impact of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) for women? It is nearly twenty years since affirmative action and {{anti-discrimination}} legislation addressed the disadvantaged position {{of women in the}} Australian labour market. During that time there has been an apparent shift in focus from addressing disadvantaged social groups toward recognising and responding to individual differences and needs. This paper examines the reasons why a selection of 'best practice' organisations say that they engage in EEO policies and practices. While the case for fairness and equal access, and the need for individuals to be protected from discrimination are used by some organisations, the business case is <b>privileged.</b> Publicly available <b>reports</b> together with confidential interviews with HR (HR) managers in a small number of organisations provide data to examine the way EEO is practiced in these organisations.

We <b>report</b> here {{the birth of}} young following transplantation of stem spermato-gonia from Long-Evans rats to the seminiferous tubules of Sprague-Dawley rats after treatment with the immunosuppres-sive agent cyclosporin. Follicle-stimulating hormone was also given to stimulate Sertoli cell proliferation, and testosterone to stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis. Donor germ cells un-derwent normal spermatogenesis, and progeny were repeatedly produced from the donor germ cells as demonstrated by micro-satellite paternity analysis. In addition, donor germ cells from the cryptorchid testes of LacZ mice were also able to colonize the seminiferous tubules of Sprague-Dawley rats using this pro-tocol.

40|$|Inflammatory lymphangiogenesis plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{development}} of inflammation and transplant rejection. The mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis during bacterial infection, toll-like receptor ligand administration, and wound healing are well characterized and depend on ligands for the vascular endothelial grow factor receptor (VEGFR) 3 that are produced by infiltrating macrophages. But inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in nonlymphoid tissues during chronic viral infection is unstudied. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) infection of the cornea is a leading cause of blindness and depends on aberrant host immune responses to antigen within the normally immunologically <b>privileged</b> cornea. We <b>report</b> that corneal HSV- 1 infection drives lymphangiogenesis and that corneal lymphatics persist past the resolution of infection. The mechanism of HSV- 1 –induced lymphangiogenesis was distinct from the described mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. HSV- 1 –elicited lymphangiogenesis was strictly dependent on VEGF-A/VEGFR- 2 signaling but not on VEGFR- 3 ligands. Macrophages played no role in the induction of lymphangiogenesis and were not a detectable source of VEGF-A. Rather, using VEGF-A reporter transgenic mice, we have identified infected epithelial cells as the primary source of VEGF-A during HSV- 1 infection. Our results indicate that HSV- 1 directly induces vascularization of the cornea through up-regulation of VEGF-A expression...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation of {{testicular}} {{cells and}} tissues {{has been studied}} for the investigation of immunology of the testis, which is an immunologically <b>privileged</b> organ. However, <b>reports</b> of transplant of the testis at organ level have been extremely limited because of technical difficulties of the orthotopic testis transplantation (OTT) in experimental animals. In the present study, we developed a new and simple model of the heterotopic testis transplantation (HTT), which is donor testis transplantation into the cervical region of recipients, in a syngeneic model in rats [donor Lewis (LEW) graft to LEW recipient]. The duration of HTT was significantly shorter and success rate {{higher than that of}} OTT. To histologically evaluate HTT, the local immune responses were compared among the syngeneic model, an acute rejection allogeneic model [donor Augustus Copenhagen Irish (ACI) graft to LEW recipient] and a chronic rejection allogeneic model (donor F 344 graft to LEW recipient) at postoperative day 3. We found that allogeneic ACI grafts resulted in mild and not severe orchitic lesions, whereas immune responses of allogeneic F 344 grafts seemed intact and were not significantly different from those of syngeneic LEW grafts. These results suggest that our new operative procedure will be useful in future for the investigation of the testicular immunology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Social {{differences}} among adolescents {{in physical activity}} and sedentary behaviour have been identified but are not well explained. The current study aimed to identify socioeconomic, family and school-related associated factors with physical activity and sedentary behaviour among high-school adolescents. Methods This was a cross-sectional analysis of T 0 physical activity and sedentary behaviour of 2523 students 14 – 18  years old recruited for the PRALIMAP trial from 24 French state-run high schools. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire {{at the start of}} grade 10. Adolescents completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for physical activity and sedentary behaviour and an ad hoc questionnaire for active commuting and sport participation. Statistical analyses involved linear and logistic regressions. Results Socioeconomic, family or school variables were associated with levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour for both boys and girls, but no factor, except perceived parental physical activity level, was associated with total energy expenditure (total physical activity) for either gender. Adolescents with privileged and less <b>privileged</b> socioeconomic status <b>reported</b> the same total amount of energy expenditure. Conclusions Total physical activity score alone is not sufficient to assess the physical activity of adolescents. These findings may have implications for better understanding of social inequalities in this context and recommendations to prevent overweight. Trial registration This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00814554). The date of registration: 23 December 2008. Registration was not required {{at the time of the}} start of PRALIMAP for public health and prevention programmes and trials...|$|R
40|$|Background This study {{examines}} a cohort in which individu-als of <b>privileged</b> socio-economic position <b>report</b> greater psychological stress. We have previously {{shown in this}} cohort that stress is unrelated to coronary heart disease as measured by hospital discharge diagnosis and cause-specific death. In contrast, stress and hospitalization for cardiovascular conditions not requiring mandatory admis-sion were associated. We hypothesized that psychosocial factors, in particular reporting tendency, are the likely medi-ator of this association, and the present study considers this further. Methods A total of 5596 men underwent a health screening during which they completed the Reeder Stress Inventory. Details of hospital admissions were retrieved from the Scot-tish Morbidity Records over a 21 year follow-up. Relation-ships between stress and admission were evaluated using proportional hazards regression. Results Compared with low stress, reported high stress {{was found to be}} associated with increased numbers of admis-sions for each of three most common cardiovascular causes of non-mandatory admission: adjusted hazard ratios were 3. 43 for essential hypertension (95 per cent confidence inter-val (CI) 1. 36 – 8. 65), 1. 91 for lower limb varicose veins (95 per cent CI 1. 12 – 3. 24), and 2. 01 for haemorrhoids (95 per cent CI 1. 16 – 3. 51). Stress and blood pressure at baseline were not associated. Conclusion The association between stress and admissions as a result of hypertension appears unlikely to be mediated by blood pressure. More likely is a mechanism based upon the reporting of symptoms, or the recording of discharge diagnoses. There is no obvious medical explanation for associations between stress and hospitalization as a result of varicose veins or haemorrhoids, and again it is likely that psychosocial factors provide the mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{the entire}} {{account of the}} guard and the chief priests can be {{discounted}} {{as likely to be}} an ahistorical addition written by Matthew to make the stolen body hypothesis appear implausible. Among scholars, it [...] "is widely regarded as an apologetic legend"; L. Michael White and Helmut Koester argue the story was probably added as an attempt to refute the Jewish claims that the disciples stole the body which were circulating at the time. [...] Atheist and historian Richard Carrier writes: The authors create a rhetorical means of putting the theft story into question by inventing guards on the tomb ... it is most suspicious that the other gospel accounts omit any mention of a guard, even when Mary visits the tomb (compare Matthew 28:1-15 with Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, and John 20:1-9), and also do not mention the theft story - this claim is not even reported in Acts, where a lot of hostile Jewish attacks on the church are recorded, yet somehow this one fails to be mentioned. Neither Peter nor Paul mention either fact, either, even though their letters predate the gospels by decades. Worse, Matthew's account involves <b>reporting</b> <b>privileged</b> conversations between priests and Pilate, and then secret ones between priests and guards that no Christian could have known about (27.62-65, 28.11-15). This is always a very suspicious sign of fiction... (Matthew) had the motive to make it up, to answer the objections of later skeptics (just like the Thomas story in John), and the story looks like an invention, because it narrates events that could not be known by the author.|$|R
