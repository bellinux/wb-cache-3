Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> home.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, it was {{reported}} that Renault’s marketing boss Patrick Blain had revealed that there were plans for several sports cars in Renault's future lineup, but stressed that the first model would not arrive until after 2010. Blain confirmed that Renault was unlikely to pick a new name for its future sports car and would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> with Alpine to brand it. Blain described it as being a “radical sports car” and not just a sports version of a regular model.|$|E
25|$|ClassesT and L {{could be}} more common {{than all the other}} classes {{combined}} if recent research is accurate. Study of the number of proplyds (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously speculated. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a protostar, which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us. Because brown dwarfs can live so long, these smaller bodies accumulate over time.|$|E

25|$|On December 30, the Union force {{moved into}} line two miles (threekm) {{northwest}} of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about four miles (sixkm) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left flank was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked {{there when he}} arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, {{but he did not}} know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's First Battle of Bull Run, both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, get into his rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.|$|E

After Patrick's birth, Pauline and Hemingway {{traveled to}} Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York. In the winter, he was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received a cable telling him {{that his father had}} killed himself. Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide.

500|$|When {{contacted}} by the CIA agent dispatched by Smith, Castillo Armas had proposed a battle-plan to gain CIA support. This plan involved three forces invading Guatemala from Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador. These invasions {{were supposed to be}} supported by internal rebellions. King formulated a plan to provide Castillo Armas with $225,000 as well as weaponry and transportation. His plan also suggested that Somoza and Juan Manuel Galvez, the President of Honduras, be persuaded to provide air support, in addition to other help. The proposal went to [...] Dulles. It also emphasized the relatively small role that the CIA was supposed to play, and stated that the plot would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> ahead without the CIA's support, but would likely fail and lead to a crackdown on anti-Communist forces.|$|E
500|$|When the 1839 Whig National Convention {{convened in}} Harrisburg, Pennsylvania {{to choose the}} party's ticket, the United States was {{in the third year}} of a serious {{recession}} following the Panic of 1837. President Van Buren's ineffective efforts to deal with the situation cost him public support. [...] With the Democratic Party torn into factions, the head of the Whig ticket would likely be the next president. Harrison, Clay, and General Winfield Scott all sought the nomination. Tyler attended the convention and was with the Virginia delegation, although he had no official status. Because of bitterness over the unresolved Senate election, the Virginia delegation refused to make Tyler its favorite son candidate for vice president. Tyler himself did nothing to aid his chances. If his favored candidate for the presidential nomination, Clay, were successful, he would likely not be chosen for the second place on the ticket, which would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> to a Northerner to assure geographic balance.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Jamie Carson of Clash disapproved of the production, calling it [...] "pompousness" [...] and [...] "annoying", and Mark Davison of No Ripcord remarked that [...] "for all the interesting noises that the band have come up [...] production really doesn't do them any favours, cramming them into a fairly narrow space and stripping them almost entirely of any sense of atmosphere", concluding that the album is nonetheless [...] "enjoyable, and will <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> down better than their last two releases." ...|$|E

500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said the episode is a [...] "convincing {{portrait}} of young marriage and hardship in the days of Reaganomics—and the biggest name to guest voice gets the littlest, but the most significant, to say". When asked to pick his favorite season out of The Simpsons seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the Niagara Gazette picked season four and highlighted [...] "the sweetly funny" [...] "Lisa's First Word". David Johnson at DVD Verdict named it [...] "one of the greatest flashback episodes". Dave Manley at DVDActive said in a review of The Simpsons: Greatest Hits DVD that it is [...] "one of the better episodes and probably my personal favourite on the disc, although most Simpsons connoisseurs would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> for the previous episode [...] ", and added that there are [...] "some great parodies in the episode too".

500|$|Current plans, however, {{have the}} Second Avenue {{platform}} {{to be built}} below the current one, though a free transfer will still be provided. The [...] "Deep Chrystie Option", as the selected proposal is called, would instead place the Second Avenue Subway platform below the Sixth Avenue Line tracks, to create {{the least amount of}} community disturbance by utilizing tunnel boring machines. Cut-and-cover methods would be utilized only at the station site. The current platforms would be widened to create space for staircases to a new intermediate mezzanine between the two levels. This new mezzanine level will also include a new fare control area with staircases, escalators and elevators leading to two new station entrances/exits, with one on either side of Grand Street between Chrystie and Forsyth Streets. Although the Second Avenue Subway platform and the new entrances/exits would be ADA accessible, it is currently unknown if the Sixth Avenue Line platforms will also become ADA accessible. However, the widening of the platforms and additional entrances would likely trigger ADA requirements for adding elevators. To the north of the station, the Second Avenue Subway would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> directly under Sara D. Roosevelt Park rather than below the Chrystie Street Connection tracks. To the south, the unused tunnel between Pell and Canal Streets could be used as an ancillary facility with the new passenger-service tunnels directly to the west.|$|E
500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E

Green opined: [...] "Although it didn't quite capture the magic of [...] it definitely comes an extremely close second." [...] He concluded: [...] "I'd <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> {{as far as to}} say that it's one of the best episodes EastEnders has produced in a long time". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian Sarah Dempster. Simon called it [...] "the EastEnders episode of the year", though was again critical of Danielle, writing: [...] "As a nation we've been driven mad by Danielle screwing up her forehead, shrugging her shoulders and walking around like a wide eyed simpleton. She isn't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it's seldom easy, I can't imagine it's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it." [...] Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude, calling it [...] "the most drawn-out 'reveal' in soapland". He deemed Ashdown's scripting of Danielle's exit to be [...] "mad crescendo after mad crescendo", and the storyline as a whole [...] "implausible", concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie's arms: [...] "EastEnders had hit the misery mother lode." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Richards Vidmer {{opened his}} account of the game as follows: [...] "The {{greatest}} naval disaster of them all took place on Ferry Field today when a hungry pack of Wolverines set upon the Navy eleven from Annapolis, snarled and snapped, chewed and clawed, and finally buried the Easterners under a defeat of 54 to 0. [...] It probably was the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would <b>probably</b> <b>go</b> down in history as Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port tonight on the leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball.

[...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener.

Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E
