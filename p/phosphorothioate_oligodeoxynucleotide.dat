40|$|We have {{previously}} described {{the characterization of}} a 20 mer <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide</b> (ISIS 4189) which inhibits murine protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo. In an effort to increase the antisense activity of this oligonucleotide, 2 '-O-propyl modifications have been incorporated into the 5 '- and 3 '-ends of the oligonucleotide, with the eight central bases left as phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Hybridization analysis demonstrated that these modifications increased affinity by approximately 8 and 6 degrees C per oligonucleotide for the phosphodiester (ISIS 7815) and phosphorothioate (ISIS 7817) respectively when hybridized to an RNA complement. In addition, 2 '-O-propyl incorporation greatly enhanced the nuclease resistance of the oligonucleotides to snake venom phosphodiesterase or intracellular nucleases in vivo. The increase in affinity and nuclease stability of ISIS 7817 resulted in a 5 -fold increase {{in the ability of}} the oligonucleotide to inhibit PKC-alpha gene expression in murine C 127 cells, as compared with the parent <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide.</b> Thus an RNase H-dependent <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide</b> can be modified as a 2 '-O-propyl 'chimeric' oligonucleotide to provide a significant increase in antisense activity in cell culture...|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{characterized}} by retinal neovascularization {{are among the}} principal causes of visual loss worldwide. The hypoxia-stimulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the proliferation of new blood vessels. We have investigated the use of antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> against murine VEGF to inhibit retinal neovascularization and VEGF synthesis in a murine model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal injections of two different antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> prior to the onset of proliferative retinopathy reduced new blood vessel growth a mean of 25 and 31 % compared with controls. This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> and resulted in a 40 - 66 % reduction {{in the level of}} VEGF protein, as determined by Western blot analysis. Control (sense, nonspecific) <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> did not cause a significant reduction in retinal neovascularization or VEGF protein levels.

40|$|Angiogenesis is {{critical}} for growth and metastatic spread of solid tumours. It is tightly controlled by specific regulatory factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been implicated as the key factor in tumour angiogenesis. In the present studies we evaluated the effects of blocking vascular endothelial growth factor production by antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> on the growth and angiogenic activity of a pre-clinical model of renal cell carcinoma (Caki- 1). In vitro studies showed that treating Caki- 1 cells with antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> directed against vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA led {{to a reduction in}} expressed vascular endothelial growth factor levels sufficient to impair the proliferation and migration of co-cultured endothelial cells. The observed effects were antisense sequence specific, dose dependent, and could be achieved at a low, non-toxic concentration of <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides.</b> When vascular endothelial growth factor antisense treated Caki- 1 cells were injected into nude mice and evaluated for their angiogenic potential, the number of vessels initiated were approximately half that induced by untreated Caki- 1 cells. To test the anti-tumour efficacy of vascular endothelial growth factor antisense, <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> were administrated to nude mice bearing macroscopic Caki- 1 xenografts. The results showed that the systemic administration of two doses of vascular endothelial growth factor antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> given 1 and 4 days after the tumours reached a size of ∼ 200 mm 3 significantly increased the time for tumours to grow to 1000 mm 3...|$|R

40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides are {{powerful}} tools for the in vivo regulation of gene expression. We have characterized the intracellular distribution of fluorescently tagged <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> (PS-ONs) at high resolution under {{conditions in which}} PS-ONs {{have the potential to}} display antisense activity. Under these conditions PS-ONs predominantly localized to the cell nucleus where they accumulated in 20 - 30 bright spherical foci designated phosphorothioate bodies (PS bodies), which were set against a diffuse nucleoplasmic population excluding nucleoli. PS bodies are nuclear structures that formed in cells after PS-ON delivery by transfection agents or microinjection but were observed irrespectively of antisense activity or sequence. Ultrastructurally, PS bodies corresponded to electron-dense structures of 150 - 300 nm diameter and resembled nuclear bodies that were found with lower frequency in cells lacking PS-ONs. The environment of a living cell was required for the de novo formation of PS bodies, which occurred within minutes after the introduction of PS-ONs. PS bodies were stable entities that underwent noticeable reorganization only during mitosis. Upon exit from mitosis, PS bodies were assembled de novo from diffuse PS-ON pools in the daughter nuclei. In situ fractionation demonstrated an association of PS-ONs with the nuclear matrix. Taken together, our data provide evidence for the formation of a nuclear body in cells after introduction of <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} factors which may effect the {{intracellular}} availability of oligonucleotides to achieve antisense activity. 15 - 20 mer unmodified, phosphorothioate modified and liposomally encapsulated oligodeoxynucleotides {{have been tested}} in leukemia MOLT- 3 cells. Phosphorothioate analogs penetrated and accumulated intact in cells in contrast to unmodified oligomers, which showed a high instability in cell culture medium. A slow decrease of intracellular concentration of undegraded <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> was observed after cell treatment and could be predominantly explained by a significant efflux transport. Using laser-assisted confocal microscopy we have observed that fluorescein 5 -end-labeled phosphorothioate derivatives predominantly distributed in intracytoplasmic endocytic vesicles following cell treatment. The end-capped version of <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> exhibited greater cellular uptake than fully modified analogues while exhibiting similar biological stability. Liposome encapsulation made possible oligomer protection in serum-containing medium and substantially improved cellular accumulation. Furthermore, the efflux rate of oligomer initially introduced within liposomes is 2 -fold lower than that observed in cells which have been incubated with free oligonucleotides. Liposomal preparations of oligodeoxynucleotides facilitate release from endocytic vesicles, and thus, cytoplasmic and nuclear localization are observed following cell treatment. Furthermore, intracellular distribution studies demonstrate that intracellular transport of unmodified oligomers is effectively achieved using the liposomal carrier...|$|R

40|$|Systemically {{administered}} <b>phosphorothioate</b> antisense <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> can specifically {{affect the}} expression of their target genes, which affords an exciting new strategy for therapeutic intervention. Earlier studies point to a major role of the liver in the disposition of these oligonucleotides. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify the cell type(s) responsible for the liver uptake of <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> and to examine the mechanisms involved. In our study we used ISIS- 3082, a <b>phosphorothioate</b> antisense <b>oligodeoxynucleotide</b> specific for murine ICAM- 1. Intravenously injected [3 H]ISIS- 3082 (dose: 1 mg/kg) was cleared from the circulation of rats with a half-life of 23. 3 +/- 3. 8 min. At 90 min after injection (> 90 % of [3 H]ISIS- 3082 cleared), the liver contained the most radioactivity, whereas the second-highest amount was recovered in the kidneys (40. 5 +/- 1. 4 % and 17. 9 +/- 1. 3 % of the dose, respectively). Of the remaining tissues, only spleen and bone marrow actively accumulated [3 H]ISIS- 3082. By injecting different doses of [3 H]ISIS- 3082, it was found that uptake by liver, spleen, bone marrow, and kidneys is saturable, which points to a receptor-mediated process. Subcellular fractionation of the liver indicates that ISIS- 3082 is internalized and delivered to the lysosomes. Liver uptake occurs mainly (for 56. 1 +/- 3. 0 %) by endothelial cells, whereas parenchymal and Kupffer cells account for 39. 6 +/- 4. 5 and 4. 3 +/- 1. 7 % of the total liver uptake, respectively. Preinjection of polyinosinic acid substantially reduced uptake by liver and bone marrow, whereas polyadenylic acid was ineffective, which indicates that in these tissues scavenger receptors are involved in uptake. Polyadenylic acid, but not polyinosinic acid, reduced uptake by kidneys, which suggests renal uptake by scavenger receptors different from those in the liver. We conclude that scavenger receptors on rat liver endothelial cells play a predominant role in the plasma clearance of ISIS- 3082. As scavenger receptors are also expressed on human endothelial liver cells, our findings are probably highly relevant for the therapeutic application of <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> in humans. If the target gene is not localized in endothelial liver cells, the therapeutic effectiveness might be improved by developing delivery strategies that redirect the oligonucleotides to the actual target cells...|$|R

This inhibitory effect can be at least 30 -fold greater with phosphorodithioate oligodeoxycytidine than for the corresponding phosphorothioate analog of similar length.

This decrease in sTnC polypeptide synthesis was not reflected in a similar decline in the steady-state level of this polypeptide. Extension of the ODN treatment to 7 days was required to produce a substantial decrease in the steady-state level of sTnC polypeptide. Our investigation suggests that during the 4 -day treatment, the affected cells stabilized the sTnC polypeptide level by increasing its half-life.

40|$|A 20 -mer <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide</b> {{designed}} to hybridize to the AUG translation initiation codon of mRNA encoding murine protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) inhibits {{the expression of}} PKC-alpha both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse C 127 mammary epithelial cells, the reduction in PKC-alpha mRNA expression was both dose and time dependent. The oligodeoxynucleotide exhibited an IC 50 value of 100 - 200 nM and reduced PKC-alpha mRNA expression for up to 48 hr. This reduction was specific for PKC-alpha versus other PKC isozymes (delta, epsilon, and zeta) and completely dependent upon oligodeoxynucleotide sequence. When administered intraperitoneally in mice, the same oligodeoxynucleotide caused a dose-dependent, oligodeoxynucleotide sequence-dependent reduction of PKC-alpha mRNA in liver, with an IC 50 value of 30 - 50 mg/kg of body weight. Inhibition of expression was 64 +/- 11 % after a single 50 -mg/kg dose. The expression of PKC-delta, epsilon, and zeta mRNA was unaffected by this treatment. The oligodeoxynucleotide activity in vivo did not require the presence of cationic liposomes or any other delivery systems, although in vitro, the oligodeoxynucleotide required cationic liposomes for inhibition of PKC-alpha expression. This study demonstrates the utility of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides as specific inhibitors of gene expression in vivo after systemic administration...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{carcinoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive tumors, and, being refractory to conventional therapies, is an excellent target for new therapeutic approaches. Based on our previous finding of high HMGA 1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic tissue, we evaluated whether suppression of HMGA 1 protein expression could be a treatment option for patients affected by pancreatic cancer. Here we report that HMGA 1 proteins are overexpressed in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, and their downregulation through an adenovirus carrying the HMGA 1 gene in an antisense orientation (Ad Yas-GFP) results in the death of three human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (PANC 1, Hs 766 T and PSN 1). Pretreatment of PANC 1 and PSN 1 cells with Ad Yas-GFP suppressed and reduced, respectively, their ability to form xenograft tumors in nude mice. To further verify the role of HMGA 1 in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we used a HMGA 1 antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide</b> (ODN); its addition induced a decrease in HMGA 1 protein levels and a significant reduction of the proliferation rate of PANC 1 -, Hs 766 T- and PSN 1 -treated cells. Therefore, suppression of HMGA 1 protein synthesis by an HMGA 1 antisense approach seems to be a feasible treatment strategy in pancreatic carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|New {{therapeutic}} {{strategies are}} now being developed against adenocarcinoma associated with erbB- 2 amplification, particularly by inhibiting p 185 erbB- 2 expression. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides seem promising for this purpose {{as long as they}} are efficiently protected against degradation and targeted into the cells. We present antisense oligonucleotide carriers, the supramolecular biovectors (SMBVs), for which we have already demonstrated the ability to improve both cellular uptake and protection of oligodeoxynucleotide. The present work demonstrates that SMBVs elicit a specific and non-toxic action of antisense compounds in a cell model, irrespective of their sensitivity to nucleases. This is a major point, considering the specificity problems associated with the use of nuclease-resistant <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotide.</b> SMBVs improve antisense efficiency of oligodeoxynucleotide designed against p 185 erbB- 2, with a complete growth arrest of SK-Br- 3, human adenocarcinoma mammary cells that overexpress p 185 erbB- 2 and no effect on MCF- 7 cells that normally express p 185 erbB- 2. The comparison of SMBVs with DOTAP reveals the statistically higher efficiency of SMBVs, which allows the antisense inhibition of p 185 erbB- 2 expression in 65 - 75 % of SK-Br- 3 cells (P < 0. 05). The efficiency and controlled synthesis of SMBVs underline their potentialities as oligodeoxynucleotide carriers for in vivo experiments...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} c-myb antisense <b>phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> [(S) ODNs] and cisplatin (CDDP) combination on the human colon carcinoma cell line LoVo Dx both in vitro and in nude mice bearing LoVo Dx solid tumour. We show that antisense (S) ODN treatment decreases c-myb mRNA and protein expression, induces growth arrest in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibits cell proliferation. In vivo treatment with c-myb antisense (S) ODNs results in a reduction in tumour growth. A greater inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and a higher increase of tumour growth inhibition and growth delay in vivo were obtained with the combination of (S) ODNs and CDDP than when the two agents were administered separately. This comparative study, using the same tumour cell line in vitro and in vivo, suggests that c-myb antisense (S) ODNs might be useful in the therapy of colon cancer in combination with antineoplastic drugs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Phosphorothioate</b> <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> (PS oligos) are {{antisense}} (sequence-specific) inhibitors of vascular {{smooth muscle}} cell (SMC) proliferation when targeted against different genes. Recently an aptameric G-quartet inhibitory effect of PS oligos has been demonstrated. To determine whether PS oligos manifest non-G-quartet, non-sequence-specific effects on human aortic SMC, {{we examined the}} effects of S-dC 28, a 28 -mer phosphorothioate cytidine homopolymer, on SMC proliferation induced by several SMC mitogens. S-dC 28 significantly inhibited SMC proliferation induced by 10 % FBS as well as the mitogens PDGF, bFGF, and EGF without cytotoxicity. Moreover, S-dC 28 abrogated PDGF-induced in vitro migration in a modified micro-Boyden chamber. Furthermore, S-dC 28 manifested in vivo antiproliferative effects in the rat carotid balloon injury model. S-dC 28 suppressed neointimal cross-sectional area by 73 % and the intima/media area ratio by 59 %. Therefore, PS oligos exert potent non-G-quartet, non-sequence-specific effects on in vitro SMC proliferation and migration as well as in vivo neointimal formation...|$|R
