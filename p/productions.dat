30|$|Generally, CBM <b>production</b> curves are {{characterized}} by gas <b>production</b> changing over time, that is, the process from no gas <b>production,</b> start of gas <b>production,</b> rise of gas <b>production,</b> reaching a peak of gas <b>production,</b> decline of gas <b>production,</b> to gas depletion. If the CBM <b>production</b> stages are divided by gas <b>production</b> rate, then gas <b>production</b> data can be directly used for division of stages. This division method is feasible in practice and theory. Therefore, this paper proposes a new four-stage division scheme based on gas <b>production</b> status, i.e., drainage stage, unstable gas <b>production</b> stage, stable gas <b>production</b> stage, and gas <b>production</b> decline stage. How to define the dividing points becomes a key problem once the classification scheme is determined. Dimensionless treatment of <b>production</b> data is widely used to conventional oil/gas and CBM <b>production</b> analysis due to {{the elimination of the}} influence of dimension on data analysis (Clarkson et al. 2008; Aminian and Ameri 2009; Freeman et al. 2013). Hence, this paper uses the dimensionless method to process gas and water <b>production</b> data. And the dimensionless gas <b>production</b> rate is chosen as an appropriate parameter, which indicates the relative change in gas and water <b>production</b> rates.|$|R

30|$|A single CBM well <b>production</b> profile (determined by the {{predicted}} <b>production,</b> hereafter {{referred to as}} the <b>production</b> profile) indicates the drainage period and volume, the gas <b>production</b> start time, the peak occurrence time and the stable <b>production</b> period (Salmachi and Yarmohammadtooski 2015).
