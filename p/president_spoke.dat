5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The <b>President</b> <b>spoke</b> for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} over the change of the seat of the German {{government}} from Bonn to Berlin, the <b>president</b> <b>spoke</b> out in favor of Berlin. In a memorandum released in February 1991, he declared that he would not act as a mere [...] "decoration of a so-called capital", urging the diet to move more constitutional organs to Berlin. To compensate for a delay in the transfer to Berlin of the government and the federal parliament, Weizsäcker declared in April 1993 that he would be performing an increased share of his duties in Berlin. He decided not to wait for the renovation and conversion as the presidential seat of the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince's Palace) at Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard, and to use instead his existing official residence in West Berlin, the Bellevue Palace beyond Tiergarten park.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October 2006, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni {{traveled}} to Juba {{to meet the}} LRA negotiators face-to-face {{for the first time}} in an attempt to revive the talks, described as [...] "stalled" [...] by BBC News and [...] "faltering" [...] by The Monitor newspaper. [...] A Uganda government source reported that the <b>president</b> <b>spoke</b> angrily and rebuked the LRA team several times, before later referring to the LRA as [...] "unserious" [...] in a subsequent address to South Sudan government officials. [...] A pall had been thrown over the talks by the murder of several dozen civilians, including the shooting of women and children in the head, near Juba during the two previous days. [...] The attacks were carried out by an as-yet unnamed group, but some suspected that the LRA was responsible for the mayhem.|$|E

50|$|The {{usage and}} {{education}} in Haitian Creole—which is not mutually intelligible with French—has been contentious {{since at least}} the 19thcentury: where Haitians saw French as a sign of colonialism, Creole was maligned by francophone elites as a miseducated or poor person’s French. Until the late 20thcentury, Haitian <b>presidents</b> <b>spoke</b> only French to their fellow citizens, and until the 2000s, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in French, a foreign language to most of the students.|$|R
2500|$|... “The <b>President</b> <b>spoke</b> truly when he boasted... 'We {{have built}} up new {{instruments}} of public power.' He spoke truly when he said these instruments could provide 'shackles for the liberties of the people... and... enslavement for the public.' These powers were granted {{with the understanding that}} they were only temporary. But after the powers had been obtained, and after the emergency was clearly over, we were told that another emergency would be created if the power was given up. In other words, the concentration of {{power in the hands of}} the President was not a question of temporary emergency. It was a question of permanent national policy. In my opinion the emergency of 1933 was a mere excuse.... National economic planning—the term used by this Administration to describe its policy—violates the basic ideals of the American system.... The price of economic planning is the loss of economic freedom. And economic freedom and personal liberty go hand in hand.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Captain Edward C. Smith (who is {{also the}} firefighters' union <b>president)</b> <b>spoke</b> to the press about a recent {{decision}} by Ellerbe {{to cut back on}} the amount of pregnancy leave for female firefighters. Within hours, Ellerbe met with Smith and said he was [...] "displeased" [...] with his comments and that Smith would [...] "pay for it". Ten days later, Smith was transferred to a job that paid less and had less responsibility. Smith filed a grievance with the D.C. Office of Employee Appeals. In February 2012, DCFEMS workers painted over the [...] "DCFD" [...] logo at Engine Co. 7 where Smith worked. No other fire stations were altered, however. In November 2012, an arbitrator ruled that Ellerbe illegally retaliated against Smith. The arbitrator also strongly criticized Ellerbe for trying to manufacture evidence against Smith, and for supplying a false rationale for Smith's transfer. When the arbitrator's ruling was made public, D.C. City Council chair Phil Mendelson called Ellerbe's action [...] "not good for the department" [...] and decried the worsening tension between the fire chief and the firefighters' union.|$|E
2500|$|On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as {{candidate}} for <b>President,</b> <b>spoke</b> during school's chapel hour. Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific {{reference to the}} university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating {{his opposition to the}} university's anti-Catholicism. (The John McCain campaign targeted Catholics with a [...] "Catholic Voter Alert," [...] phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor of New York for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-Catholic statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, [...] "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone." [...] Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from Bangladesh, and later push polling also implied that the child was biracial.) ...|$|E

2500|$|When Israel {{refused to}} {{withdraw}} its {{troops from the}} Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh, Eisenhower declared, [...] "We must not allow Europe to go flat on its back for the want of oil." [...] He sought UN-backed efforts to impose economic sanctions on Israel until it fully withdrew from Egyptian territory. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson and minority leader William Knowland objected to American pressure on Israel. Johnson told the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that he wanted him to oppose [...] "with all its skill" [...] any attempt to apply sanctions on Israel. Dulles rebuffed Johnson's request, and informed Eisenhower of the objections made by the Senate. Eisenhower was [...] "insistent on applying economic sanctions" [...] {{to the extent of}} cutting off private American assistance to Israel which was estimated to be over $100million a year. Ultimately, the Democratic Party-controlled Senate would not cooperate with Eisenhower's position on Israel. Eisenhower finally told Congress he would take the issue to the American people, saying, [...] "America has either one voice or none, and that voice is the voice of the President – whether everybody agrees with him or not." [...] The <b>President</b> <b>spoke</b> to the nation by radio and television where he outlined Israel's refusal to withdraw, explaining his belief that the UN had [...] "no choice but to exert pressure upon Israel".|$|E
