500|$|While {{the meaning}} of {{mechanical}} filter {{in this article is}} one that is used in an electromechanical role, it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with mechanical components. [...] In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains. [...] A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b>|$|E

Also, the above expression [...] is a quadratic form of signature (3,1) on spacetime, and the group of transformations which leaves this quadratic form invariant is the indefinite orthogonal group O(3,1), a Lie group. In other words, the Lorentz group is O(3,1). As <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> any Lie groups mentioned are matrix Lie groups.
