25|$|The self-wringing mop {{is a type}} of mop {{designed}} to be wrung out without getting a user's hands wet. The first self-wringing mop was invented in 1990 by Joy Mangano. The mop head was created from 300 feet of cotton and was developed so {{that it was possible to}} be wrung out by turning a <b>plastic</b> <b>handle</b> above the mop head itself. It became widely used in America by the mid 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to prison}} officials, Fenton {{had made the}} [...] "ice picks" [...] from metal guide bars on his typewriter. He was cited for [...] having a 15-inch {{sharpened}} steel rod, complete with a <b>plastic</b> <b>handle,</b> hidden under his pillow in his cell. Fenton said he was motivated to attack out of anger at Devlin's crimes. Investigation of the assault is ongoing and Fenton may face charges related to the attack. Devlin's security has been a concern for state prison officials since his arrest. Officials contemplated sending him out of state or providing him with a new identity. However, some victims' family members objected to the move, and the plan was dropped.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{material for}} the handle is birch. Also oak, ash, pine bark, horn (especially elk and reindeer), scrimshaw and bone are used.

5000|$|Spaghetti fork: A fork with a {{metal shaft}} loosely fitted inside a hollow <b>plastic</b> <b>handle.</b> The shaft {{protrudes}} through {{the top of the}} handle, ending in a crank, that allows the metal part of the fork to be easily rotated with one hand while the other hand is holding the <b>plastic</b> <b>handle.</b> This supposedly allows spaghetti to be easily wound onto the tines. Electric variations of this fork have become more prevalent in modern times.|$|E

50|$|Toy clash cymbals {{and some}} others have wooden or <b>plastic</b> <b>handles</b> instead. China type clash cymbals need no handles as the squared bells can be held quite {{securely}} without them, and are often joined by a cord through the holes in their bells which allows the player to release the bells after striking producing less damping and greater sustain, and to swing the cymbals producing doppler effects.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Prodyne Gourmet Cheese Slicer had {{a wooden}} board with a slot cut {{into it and}} a hole through which {{one end of a}} U-shaped steel cutting arm was inserted. In the patented design, a stainless steel wire extends between the two ends of the cutting arm fit into the slot, and cuts the cheese. The wire has loops at each end; one loop is around the steel cutting arm in the slot, while the other passes around a metal pin though a <b>plastic</b> <b>handle</b> {{on the other end of}} the cutting arm. The <b>plastic</b> <b>handle</b> rotates upward to tighten the wire, and is secured to the cutting arm with a screw.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>handles</b> {{are more}} easily cared for than wooden handles and do not absorb microorganisms.

5000|$|A major {{expansion}} {{was undertaken}} in 1958-59, {{which was also}} the first time that all five sheets had matched stones. In 1962 a new ice base was installed, with indirect refrigeration which removed the hazard of pressurized ammonia gas inside the curling shed. The interior was upgraded in 1975 and 76 (paneling and modern kitchen). Most importantly, our stones were replaced {{at the start of the}} 1985-86 season with the new Ailsa Craig insert stones with modern <b>plastic</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and <b>plastic</b> <b>handles.</b> The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|R
5000|$|Plastics can {{be readily}} formed by molding {{into a variety of}} shapes useful for kitchen utensils. Transparent plastic {{measuring}} cups allow ingredient levels to be easily visible, and are lighter and less fragile than glass measuring cups. <b>Plastic</b> <b>handles</b> added to utensils improve comfort and grip. While many plastics deform or decompose if heated, a few silicone products can be used in boiling water or in an oven for food preparation. Non-stick plastic coatings can be applied to frying pans; newer coatings avoid the issues with decomposition of plastics under strong heating.|$|R

40|$|Background: Most popular {{single-use}} acupuncture needles {{consist of}} a stainless steel shaft with a handle made of copper coil or plastic stick. Objectives: To determine {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of these two handle types for needle buckling. Methods: The buckling load for acupuncture needles with these two different handle types was determined using a digital scale, and the stiffness of stainless steel wires used in different types of acupuncture needles was measured using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis machine. Results: This study showed that an acupuncture needle with a copper coil handle was far more susceptible to buckling than a needle with a <b>plastic</b> stick <b>handle.</b> The average buckling force of acupuncture needles with <b>plastic</b> stick <b>handles</b> was 46. 7 % higher than that with copper coil handles for needles of 0. 25 mmx 30 mm, and 30. 8 % higher for needles of 0. 25 mmx 60 mm. Replacing a copper coil <b>handle</b> with a <b>plastic</b> stick <b>handle</b> could save about 100 tonnes of copper wires and 20 million metres of medical grade stainless steel wire a year worldwide. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that the common practice of using coiled copper for handles on acupuncture needles should be re-evaluated. Replacing a copper coil <b>handle</b> with a <b>plastic</b> stick <b>handle</b> would significantly reduce needle buckling and improve patient comfort and safety. This would also reduce the consumption of copper and medical grade stainless steel wire considerably...|$|R
