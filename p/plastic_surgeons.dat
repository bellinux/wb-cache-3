25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient.

25|$|In 2007 Salt Lake City {{was ranked}} by Forbes {{as the most}} vain city in America, {{based on the number}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> per 100,000 and their {{spending}} habits on cosmetics, which exceed cities of similar size. However, this likely reflects a concentration of <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> within the city limits but whose client base includes the entire metropolitan area. Forbes also found the city to be the 8th most stressful. In contrast to the 2007 ranking by Forbes, a 2010 study conducted by Portfolio.com and bizjournals concluded Salt Lake City was the least stressful city in the United States. In 2014, CNN deemed Salt Lake City to be the least stressed-out city in the United States, citing the low cost of living and abundance of jobs.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-twentieth century, Morton I. Berson, in 1945, and Jacques Maliniac, in 1950, each {{performed}} flap-based breast augmentations {{by rotating}} the patient’s chest wall tissue into the breast {{to increase its}} volume. Furthermore, throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> used synthetic fillers—including silicone injections received by some 50,000 women, from which developed silicone granulomas and breast hardening that required treatment by mastectomy. In 1961, the American <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the Dow Corning Corporation, developed the first silicone breast prosthesis, filled with silicone gel; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962 using the Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963. In 1964, the French company Laboratoires Arion developed and manufactured the saline breast implant, filled with saline solution, and then introduced {{for use as a}} medical device in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for necrotizing {{fasciitis}} may involve an interdisciplinary care team. For example, {{in the case}} of a {{necrotizing fasciitis}} involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Maintaining strict asepsis during any surgical procedure and regional anaesthesia techniques is vital in preventing the occurrence of the disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{reconstructive}} procedures are tumor removal, laceration repair, scar repair, hand surgery, and breast reduction plasty. According to the American Society of <b>Plastic</b> <b>Surgeons,</b> {{the number of}} reconstructive breast reductions for women increased in 2007 by 2 percent from the year before. Breast reduction in men also increased in 2007 by 7 percent. In 2012, there were 68,416 performed.|$|E
25|$|These {{specialty}} {{areas of}} medicine are not exclusive to orthopedic surgery. For example, hand surgery is practiced by some <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> and spine surgery is practiced by most neurosurgeons. Additionally, foot and ankle surgery is practiced by board-certified Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) in the United States. Some family practice physicians practice sports medicine; however, their scope of practice is non-operative.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> use {{microsurgery}} {{to transfer}} tissue for {{coverage of a}} defect when no local tissue is available.

In contrast, primary care physicians were the least satisfied, followed by nephrologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, and pulmonologists. Surveys have also revealed high levels of depression among medical students (25 - 30%) as well as among physicians in training (22 - 43%), which for many specialties, continue into regular practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} of liposuction (lipoplasty) was conceived and {{developed by the}} Italian <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> Arpat Fischer and Giorgio Fischer in 1974, and was put into medico-clinical practice in 1975. Access to the woman's autologous adipocyte fat was by means of 5-mm incisions, and was harvested with an electrically and pneumatically –powered instrument, which rotated and alternated in its aspiration of the fat through a cannula. Meanwhile, through a separate incision to the fat-tissue harvest site, saline solution was injected to dilute the body fat, and so facilitate its aspiration.|$|E
25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape at the outside of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E
25|$|Positional Plagiocephaly – IN 1992, to {{decrease}} the incidence of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics initiated the “Back to Sleep” campaign, which recommended that babies be put to sleep on their backs. While this almost halved the number of SIDS deaths, the campaign appeared to also help raise plagiocephaly incidence fivefold, to roughly one in sixty live births. Plagiocephaly is simply the flattening of one area of the skull, generally one babies tend to favor as they lie. While treatment is often as simply as repositioning the baby during sleep, in more pronounced cases helmet therapy may be put to use. In most cases, plagiocephaly is quite minor and easily resolved, with many more pediatric <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeons</b> becoming familiar with helmet therapy for more advanced cases.|$|E
