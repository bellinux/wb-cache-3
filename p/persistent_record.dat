5000|$|In some {{systems and}} {{in the context of}} message {{processing}} systems (often realtime systems), this term also refers to the goal of establishing a single agreed sequence of messages within a database formed by a particular but arbitrary sequencing of records. The key concept is that data combined in a certain sequence is a [...] "truth" [...] which may be analyzed and processed giving particular results, and that although the sequence is arbitrary (and thus another correct but equally arbitrary sequencing would ultimately provide different results in any analysis), it is desirable to agree that the sequence enshrined in the [...] "single version of the truth" [...] is the version that will be considered [...] "the truth", and that any conclusions drawn from analysis of the database are valid and unarguable, and (in a technical context) the database may be duplicated to a backup environment to ensure a <b>persistent</b> <b>record</b> is kept of the [...] "single version of the truth".|$|E

It is commonly agreed that China led the world in science and technology from about the tenth century to about the fifteenth century. The Chinese sciences and technologies were concentrated in several fields, mainly material production, transport, weaponry and medicine. A common feature of all Chinese discoveries was their trial-and-error basis and incremental improvement. Here, China's continued history and large population became an advantage. However, this trial-and-error approach had its developmental ceiling. And, incremental improvement faced diminishing returns. So, although China once led the world, it was unable to realize {{what is known as the}} [...] "Scientific Revolution" [...] whose origin may well have been oriental/Chinese.|$|E

Many traditional modelling approaches from Structured Analysis [6], [14] to UML-based methods [7] supporting him in this task neglect the use of concrete examples about current or future system usage.

50|$|A {{challenge}} in automating {{the reporting of}} radiation exposure estimations has traditionally been a function of whether the record of dose provided by a manufacturer is persistent (i.e. stored electronically) or transient (i.e. displayed on a read-out). Many current radiology devices provide only transient records, either {{in the form of}} human-readable dose screens that require manual intervention (i.e. pencil and paper) to permanently capture the patient exposure, or else in the equally perishable data generated by a modality-performed procedure step (MPPS) created to help manage the scheduling system. MPPS is insufficient, having a limited ability to encode complex data, and no options for long-term storage or queries. Newer scanners are able to create DICOM Radiation Dose Structured Reports (RDSRs) alongside the images themselves. REM addresses perishable dose data by creating a <b>persistent</b> <b>record</b> that can be sent to a central repository, and then queried and analyzed by health information systems for either a specific patient's history or for analysis of radiation exposure levels among patient groups, platforms, or clinical operations. RDSRs, {{and the use of the}} IHE REM framework are part of the IEC 61910 standard.|$|E

40|$|There {{exists a}} high {{demand for a}} continuous, <b>persistent</b> <b>recording</b> of {{non-invasive}} electroencephalograms in both clinical and research fields. Head-cap electrodes with metal conductors and conductive gels are widely used and considered as {{the gold standard for}} such measurement. This physical interface, however, is poorly suited to uninterrupted, long-term use due to the uncomfortable rigid electrodes, skin irritation due to the gel, and electrical degradation as the gel dries.

40|$|Abstract—Emerging {{non-volatile}} memory (NVM) technologies enable data persistence {{at the main}} memory level at access speeds close to DRAM. In such persistent memories, memory writes need to be performed in strict order to satisfy storage consistency requirements and enable correct recovery from system crashes. Unfortunately, adhering to a strict order for writes to persistent memory significantly degrades system performance as it requires flushing dirty data blocks from CPU caches and waiting for their completion at the main memory in the order specified by the program. This paper introduces a new mechanism, called Loose-Ordering Consistency (LOC), that satisfies the ordering requirements of persistent memory writes at significantly lower performance degradation than state-of-the-art mechanisms. LOC consists of two key techniques. First, Eager Commit reduces the commit overhead for writes within a transaction by eliminating the need to perform a <b>persistent</b> commit <b>record</b> write at th...|$|R

40|$|The use of collaboratively {{produced}} assignments {{for assessment}} {{is a risky}} undertaking for both students and course designers, especially in higher education. Yet the benefits, in terms of graduate capabilities, collaborative sense making and student involvement, suggest that the effort is worthwhile. Among the critical elements {{for the design of}} a collaborative assignment (such as a Web Inquiry Project) are clearly expressed expectations and considerable scaffolding of the task. However, formal descriptions and rules do little to ameliorate the perception of risk and increased anxiety by students. This paper reports on a longitudinal design experiment that was conducted in a large first-year university course. The study included past students who provided informal and authentic advice for present students as they were engaged in a collaborative assignment. Thus, through mediated communication channels (such as video interviews, cameo appearances and online forums), the past students provided voices that complemented the course designer's formal descriptions. Analysis of the conversations between the past and present students reveals them to be simultaneously rich, functional and reflective. In particular, the past students forum grew into a multi-threaded, complex set of conversations that covered a substantial set of topics and concerns for the current students. It proved functional because it promoted confidence, had immediate application and was clearly expressed for these students. And because the forum remained as a <b>persistent</b> <b>record,</b> it provided the basis for reflective thinking about the task and how it might be approached. As a technique that is relatively easy to set up, using a simple online forum along with considerate and able past students, the method described has immediate practical application...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the understandings and meanings of personal blogging {{from the perspective}} of blog authors. The theoretical framework draws on a symbolic interactionist perspective, focusing on how meaning is constructed through blogging practices, supplemented by theories of mediation and critical technology studies. The principal evidence in this study is derived from an analysis of in-depth interviews with bloggers selected to maximise their diversity {{based on the results of}} an initial survey. This is supplemented by an analysis of personal blogging’s technical contexts and of various societal influences that appear to influence blogging practices. Bloggers were found to have limited interest in gathering information about their readers, appearing to rely instead on an assumption that readers are sympathetic. Although personal blogging practices have been framed as being a form of radically free expression, they were also shown to be subject to potential biases including social norms and the technical characteristics of blogging services. Blogs provide a <b>persistent</b> <b>record</b> of a blogger’s practice, but the bloggers in this study did not generally read their archives or expect others to do so, nor did they retrospectively edit their archives to maintain a consistent self-presentation. The empirical results provide a basis for developing a theoretical perspective to account for blogging practices. This emphasises firstly that a blogger’s construction of the meaning of their practice can be based as much on an imagined and desired social context as it is on an informed and reflexive understanding of the communicative situation. Secondly, blogging practices include a variety of envisaged audience relationships, and some blogging practices appear to be primarily self-directed with potential audiences playing a marginal role. Blogging’s technical characteristics and the social norms surrounding blogging practices appear to enable and reinforce this unanticipated lack of engagement with audiences. This perspective contrasts with studies of computer mediated communication that suggest bloggers would monitor their audiences and present themselves strategically to ensure interactions are successful in their terms. The study also points the way towards several avenues for further research including a more in-depth consideration of the neglected structural factors (both social and technical) which potentially influence blogging practices, and an examination of social network site use practices using a similar analytical approach...|$|E
