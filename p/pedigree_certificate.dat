50|$|Tetsunoshin is a seven-month-old Toy Poodle {{living with}} the Inuyama Family. His owner is Rumi Inuyama. He and his owner were once from Kyushu {{before moving to the}} Hoppongi Hills in Tokyo. He speaks with a Kyushu accent and loves his owner and very much, and will do {{anything}} {{to get them out of}} bankruptcy. Tetsunoshin has a very long 5 meter <b>pedigree</b> <b>certificate</b> scroll, containing his family lineage (though its contents were washed off in Episode 25) and he is the 81st of the 102 born poodles. He also has a crush on Chocolat and likes her a lot. With Seto's powers, he can assume his human form as Celebrity Knight. As Celebrity Knight, he supports his master in many ways and tries to make her happy, though this transformation lasts for only three minutes.|$|E
40|$|Behavioural testing allows {{to exclude}} dogs that are fearful and {{aggressive}} from the breeding population, but relatively {{little is known}} about the effectiveness of such strategies in practice. From 2001 till 2009 parent purebred Dutch Rottweilers had to pass the Socially Acceptable Behaviour (SAB) -test for their offspring to obtain a <b>pedigree</b> <b>certificate.</b> We evaluated if this breeding policy of excluding fearful and aggressive Rottweilers, as diagnosed by the SAB-test, indeed reduced the prevalence of fear and aggression in the Dutch Rottweiler population. Owner-reported assessments of their dogs' behaviour were compared between groups of Rottweilers with or without pedigree certificates, assuming the Rottweiler look-a-likes to represent the control condition of no breeding policy regarding fear and aggression. A total of 822 Rottweiler owners filled out the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) on problem behaviour, including 7 behavioural categories related to fear and aggression. Problem behaviour prevalence and explanatory factors were investigated by multivariable logistic regression. The prevalence of Stranger-directed fear (P. <. 0. 05) and Non-social fear (P. <. 0. 01) was lower in the group of pedigrees than in the group of look-a-likes, with a same tendency for Stranger-directed aggression (P = 0. 056). Analysing the combined C-BARQ scores for the behaviour categories that are assessed with the SAB-test, namely Stranger-directed aggression, Dog-directed fear/aggression, Stranger-directed fear and Non-social fear, revealed that one sixth of the pedigree Rottweilers showed these behaviours compared to one third of the look-a-likes (P. <. 0. 0001). Strong associations were found between Stranger-directed aggression and Dog-directed fear/aggression (P. <. 0. 001) or Social Fear (P. <. 0. 001), indicating the role of fear in aggression towards unfamiliars. The association between Stranger-directed aggression and chase proneness (P. <. 0. 01) seems to illustrate how different motivations may underlie a same manifestation of aggression. Familiar dog aggression associated with Owner-directed aggression (P. <. 0. 001), implicating that such aggressions may have do with conflicts over status. Found associations between types of fear/aggression will have in part reflected shared underlying causes, and reflect the known comorbidity of problem behaviours. Their associations with dog and/or owner characteristics indicated several possible risk factors for fear/aggression. However, associations with common risk factors like sex and reproductive status were not found. Taking into account behaviour test outcomes in Rottweiler pedigree certification was associated with a reduced prevalence of fear and aggression. The exclusion of fear/aggressive individuals from the breeding population on the basis of SAB-test outcomes may have had favourable effects on population genetics or incited preventive actions by breeders like not putting a dog forward for pedigree certification. In our view, validated behaviour tests like the SAB-test can help to reduce unwanted behaviours in dog populations by breeding policies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Lao PDR s National Strategy for Fisheries {{stipulates}} {{the expected}} outcomes, work plan, and framework aimed at attaining {{the implementation of}} current plans and long-term projects up to 2020. Government estimates percent per capita consumption of aquatic animals and aquatic animal products at 15 kg per annum, i. e. accounting for about 40 % of the animal protein intake, and targets to increase its per capita availability of fish to 23 kg by the year 2020. Lao PDR does not have areas for shrimp culture but researches on the migration pattern and reproductive biology of indigenous shrimp species found in the rivers have been undertaken. Inspection of documents for import, transit and export of live aquatic animals at international checkpoints before entry into Lao PDR has been likewise implemented. With regard to importation, permission of import-export (final destination and origin country), <b>certificate</b> of <b>pedigree,</b> and <b>certificate</b> of sanitary quality are being required. In addition, disease-free status (especially those notifiable to the World Organization of Animal Health [OIE]) of imported shrimps and other aquatic organisms is mandatory at international checkpoints before entry into Lao PDR. For shipments suspected to harbor diseases, samples are sent for analysis at the Namxouang Aquaculture Development Center (NADC), Department of Livestock and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Vientiane, Lao PDR...|$|R
50|$|From the {{examination}} of horse teeth that were excavated from shell middens in Gwakji-ri and in Handeulgul Cave in Wollyeong-ri, horses are estimated to have been on Jejudo Island {{since the end of}} the Stone Age or the beginning of the Bronze Age. A historical document of the Goryeo Dynasty, recorded in 1073 A.D. (the 27th year of King Moonjong’s reign), states that an excellent steed was presented to the king from Jeju, which indicates Jeju has a long history of breeding horses. Systematic management of Jeju horses at a national level started in 1276 when a state-run ranch, Tamna Ranch, was constructed to accommodate 160 horses imported from Mongolia. According to another record, Jeju continued to import Mongolian horses for more than a century, until 1374. In the ancient times, Jeju provided horses upon the central government’s request, and bred approximately 20,000 horses.Starting in the 1960s, the usability of horses decreased as other means of transportation developed. In addition, the Korea Racing Authority introduced other breeds, such as the Anglo-Arabian and the Thoroughbred in late 1970s in order to produce race horses. Some of the foreign-bred stallions were used to create cross-breed horses, which contributed to the decreased number of native Jeju horses. In mid 1980s, the population of the Jeju horse dropped to approximately 1,200.In 1986, the central government designated the horse as Natural Monument No. 347, named ‘Jeju Horse of Jeju,’ to prevent it from extinction and to preserve its breeds as state-designated cultural properties. Currently, more than 150 native Jeju horses are being raised within a protection area.In 2000, the government appointed the Jeju Stockbreeding Promotion Institute as a designated agency to register and breed Jeju horses. It also established the Rules on the Registration and Management of Jeju Horses to maintain their pedigrees. An electronic chip is implanted into a new-born foal for identification. To confirm the <b>pedigree,</b> an accreditation <b>certificate</b> is issued after identifying the relationship between the parent horses and the foal using paternity tests recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics. The pedigree-related information on Jeju horses is offered via the Jeju Horse Database System.|$|R
