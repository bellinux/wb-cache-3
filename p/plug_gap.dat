5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap</b> gauge is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.

50|$|The spark {{across the}} spark plug's {{electrodes}} forms a small kernel of flame approximately {{the size of}} the spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap.</b> As it grows in size, its heat output increases, which allows it to grow at an accelerating rate, expanding rapidly through the combustion chamber. This growth is due to the travel of the flame front through the combustible fuel air mix itself, and due to turbulence which rapidly stretches the burning zone into a complex of fingers of burning gas that have a much greater surface area than a simple spherical ball of flame would have. In normal combustion, this flame front moves throughout the fuel/air mixture at a rate characteristic for the particular mixture. Pressure rises smoothly to a peak, as nearly all the available fuel is consumed, then pressure falls as the piston descends. Maximum cylinder pressure is achieved a few crankshaft degrees after the piston passes TDC, so that the force applied on the piston (from the increasing pressure applied to the top surface of the piston) can give its hardest push precisely when the piston's speed and mechanical advantage on the crank shaft gives the best recovery of force from the expanding gases, thus maximizing torque transferred to the crank shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap</b> (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E

Variations spark <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> distance of 0. 5 mm was started, 0. 6 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 8 um; 0. 9 mm, and 1 mm.

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports an {{investigation}} of detection of knock and misre in the spark ignition engine {{by means of the}} ionic current method. In the knock experiments, two detecting methods are used. One is the ionic current method. High frequency signals will be added to the ionic current signals where knocking is happening, which can be detected by picking up these signals. The other is the engine block vibration method. Knock can also be detected by monitoring signals of the vibration sensor in a proper position. The signals of the two kinds of methods are recorded at the same time with a dual-channel oscilloscope. With wave comparison and fast Fourier transform analy-sis, the advantages of the ionic current method can be shown and its feasibility and reliability can be proved further. In misre experiments, misre can occur by adjusting spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap,</b> adding carbon deposits and cutting out high voltages. A remarkable dierence exists between misre and non-misre ionic current signals in shape and amplitude. By detecting these changes, misre detection can be realized.

40|$|An {{efficient}} combustion {{depends on}} many factors, such as injection, turbulence and ignition characteristics. With {{the improvement of}} internal combustion engines the turbulence intensity and internal pressure have risen, demanding more efficient and powerful ignition systems. In direct injection engines, the stratified charge resultant from the wall/air-guided or spray-guided system requires even more energy. The Paschen’s law shows that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap</b> and mixture density are proportional to the dielectric rupture voltage. It is known that larger spark gaps promote higher efficiency in the internal combustion engines, since the mixture reaction rate rises proportionally. However, the ignition system must be adequate to the imposed gap, not only on energy, but also on voltage and spark duration. For the reported study in this work two test benches were built: a standard inductive ignition system and a capacitive discharge high energy ignition system, with variable voltage and capacitance.

40|$|Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{combustion}} phasing {{and stability}} provides a challenging control problem over conventional combustion technologies of Spark Ignition (SI) and Compression Ignition (CI). Due to the auto ignition {{nature of the}} HCCI combustion there are no direct methods for actuation, the combustion and the phasing relies on indirect methods. This in itself creates a nonlinear dynamic problem between the relationships of control actuators and the combustion behavior. In order to control the process, an accurate feedback signal is necessary to determine {{the state of the}} actual combustion process. Ideally to ensure that combustion remains stable and phased correctly an in-cylinder feedback of each cylinder for multi cylinder engines would be preferable. Feedback has been seen in studies using piezoelectric pressure sensors for visually monitoring the pressure in the combustion chamber. This is expensive and requires redesign of the combustion chamber. A potential alternative feedback is to use the conventional spark plug as a sensor. This is achieved by applying a voltage across the spark plug to provide a sensor for ion current. The ions are created through the combustion event, and the current is created by the flow of the ions between the spark <b>plug</b> <b>gap.</b> The work presented in this paper provides a comparison between ion current feedback and pressure trace for a two stroke HCCI combustion from a control perspective. The emphasis of the work is to show the capability of using the ion current system as feedback for information for the start of combustion, combustion duration, and rate of combustion and estimations on peak pressure magnitude.
