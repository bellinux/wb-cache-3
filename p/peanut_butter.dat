5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made with <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include {{the substitution of}} wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and marshmallow fluff.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to <b>peanut</b> <b>butter,</b> and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

40|$|Therapeutic {{foodstuff}} are {{a challenge}} {{for the use of}} food and functional food ingredients in the therapy of different pathologies. Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) are a mixture of nutrients designed and primarily addressed to the therapy of the severe acute malnutrition. The main ingredients of the formulation are powdered milk, <b>peanuts</b> <b>butter,</b> vegetal oil, sugar, and a mix of vitamins, salts, and minerals. The potential of this food are the low percentage of free water and the high energy and nutritional density. The high cost of the powdered milk, and the food safety problems connected to the onset of toxigenic moulds on the <b>peanuts</b> <b>butter,</b> slowed down considerably the widespread and homogenous diffusion of this product. This paper presents {{the state of the art}} of RUTF, reviews the different proposed recipes, suggests some possible new formulations as an alternative of novel recipes for this promising food...|$|R
5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and marshmallow fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow Fluff, a brand of marshmallow fluff, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} how sensory {{attributes and}} consumer acceptability of <b>peanut</b> <b>butters</b> varied with differing roasting times (40 to 55 min) and storage times (up to 48 weeks) for shelf-life testing. Quantitative descriptive analysis generated sensory terms that were {{appropriate to the}} local situation. Increased roasting time {{was associated with the}} sensory attributes brown colour, roasted taste and burnt taste. Consumer acceptance varied among consumers with two preferred roasting times of either 40 min (67 % of consumers) or 50 min (23 % of consumers). This was related to distinct peanut flavour profiles. During the storage study of five selected butters consumer acceptability did not alter with storage period. Sensory testing, however, was more sensitive to product changes: sensory attributes that varied with storage were sticky texture, stale odour and sweetness...|$|R
5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E

40|$|Therapeutic {{foods are}} foods {{designed}} for specific, usually nutritional, therapeutic purposes {{as a form}} of dietary supplement. The primary examples of therapeutic foods are used for emergency feeding of malnourished children or to supplement the diets of persons with special nutrition requirements, such as the elderly. Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) is a mixture of nutrients designed and primarily addressed to the therapy of the severe acute malnutrition without complications. The recent success of home-based therapy has been seen in conjunction with the availability of a novel food, a spread form of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). The main ingredients of the formulation are powdered milk, <b>peanuts</b> <b>butter,</b> vegetal oil, sugar, and a mix of vitamins, salts, and minerals. The effectiveness of ready to use therapeutic food within the person’s own home for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children under five years of age has been found not to be different than standard care.

5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine.

50|$|The {{crude oil}} engine {{is a type}} of {{internal}} combustion engine similar to the hot bulb engine. A crude oil engine could be driven by all sorts of oils such as engine waste oil and vegetable oils. Even <b>peanut</b> oil and <b>butter</b> could be used as fuel if necessary. Like hot bulb engines, crude oil engines were mostly used as stationary engines or in boats. They can run {{for a very long time}}; for instance, at the world fair in Milan in 1906, a FRAM engine was started and ran until the exhibition was over one month later. A crude oil engine is a low RPM engine dimensioned for constant running and can last for a very long time if maintained properly. It was later replaced by the diesel engine.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Nairobi, Nyanza and Western provinces in Kenya between March and July 2009 with 1263 peanut products sampled out of which 705 samples underwent microbial analysis. Thestudy aimed at determining the incidence of fungal species e emphasis on Aspergillus section Flavi eassociated with peanut products. A 0. 5 kg representative sample was obtained from each surveyedvendor and the colony forming units (CFU) of fungal species determined. The samples were also analyzedfor total aflatoxin level while isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus were screened forproduction of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2. Eight fungal species were detected in the samples and were indecreasing order of CFU/g of sample: A. flavus S-strain (467), A. flavus L-strain (341), Penicillium spp. (326), Aspergillus niger (156), Aspergillus tamari (27), Aspergillus alliaceus (21), A. parasiticus (10), andAspergillus caelatus (5). The overall incidence of A. flavus S-strain in samples from Nairobi was 92 and 1425 % higher than samples from Nyanza and Western regions, respectively. The combined incidence ofA. flavus and A. parasiticus was varied significantly (p _ 0. 05) with peanut product: peanut flour (69 %),shelled raw peanuts (53 %), spoilt peanuts (49 %), boiled podded peanuts (45 %), podded <b>peanuts</b> (39 %),peanut <b>butter</b> (31 %), fried peanuts (22 %) and roasted peanuts (20 %). Seventy three percent of A. flavusand A. parasiticus isolates produced {{at least one of}} the aflatoxin types, with 66 % producing aflatoxin B 1. The total aflatoxin level among peanut products ranged from 0 to 1629 mg/g; and there was a positivecorrelation (r ¼ 0. 2711) between the incidence of A. flavus and A. parasiticus, and total aflatoxin level. Thehigh incidence of aflatoxin producing fungi in peanuts traded in Kenyan markets implies a risk of aflatoxincontamination, highlighting the need for stakeholders to promote sound practices at all stages ofthe peanut value chain in order to minimize market access by non-complying products.
