40|$|Among train track {{equipment}} that feeds power to train cars, contact wires make {{direct contact with}} train cars ' currency collectors to feed power into the vehicle. Mechanical contacts with currency collectors cause wear on the contact wires, therefore, their wearing depth is always monitored such that proper functionality of the equipment can be maintained by replacing wires that have worn deeper than the specified reference value. Since contact wires do not wear evenly, parts that are worn more than others {{are the first to}} be replaced in existing lines. This will then lead to the necessity of connecting contact wires in the middle. Conventionally, contact wires were arranged in parallel and fixed with double ear fittings (double ear connections) as seen in Figure 1. However, double ear connections had the following structural features: 1) double ear fittings are heavy, weighing about 450 g to 800 g (depending on the wire format), 2) for each connected part, three fittings must be installed with an interval of approximately 30 cm, and 3) two contact wires must be arranged in parallel. These features have been a safety concern since these structural features would lead to problems including lowering of power collecting capabilities at the connected parts and wearing of wires. For these reasons, contact wires are not connected in the middle by double ear fittings for Shinkansen; entire sections between anchors are replaced, even though wear is localized. Therefore, as a new contact wire connection method to replace the double ear connection method, we focused on the cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding</b> method, developed a device for carrying out such cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding,</b> and examined the wear of welded parts of actual operating equipment.

40|$|Abstract. Braze <b>Pressure</b> <b>Welding</b> (BPW) {{with high}} {{frequency}} induction heating is a newly developed <b>pressure</b> <b>welding</b> technique using interlayer metals for welding the general steel pipes for pipe arrangement in buildings. BPW enables to make joints by solid-state welding in air using a flux sheet {{which is also}} developed for this technique. In this method, the interlayer metal is expected to play the primary role in making high performance joints. At a joining temperature, the melted interlayer removes contaminations from the joining surfaces of the base metals. Then the liquid filler is discharged from the joining interface by the joining pressure, and forms fillets at the gaps around the joint. In this stage, the joining pressure is relatively small, so the welding deformation can be restrained to a minimum. The fillets have the effects both on relaxing the stress concentration at the joint and on increasing the joining area, which contribute to the strengthening of the joint. Thus, the high quality pipe joining without the dispersion in joint properties due to welder’s skill can be performed. In this report, the concept and merits of BPW are explained, {{and the results of}} the investigation on the cleaning effect of the interlayer metal and the effects of fillet formation on strengthening the joint are discussed. The practical application of BPW in Japan is also introduced. 1. Introduction and General Ide...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental and finite element studies of cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding</b> of commercial purity aluminium by divergent extrusion. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I gives a general introduction to welding of aluminium alloys focusing on the heat affected zone (HAZ) strength loss following traditional fusion welding, the mechanisms of solid state bonding and {{the most commonly used}} solid state joining techniques for such materials. In Part II the divergent extrusion method, originally designed for simulation of cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding,</b> has been further developed and explored. As a starting point the combination of advanced process instrumentation and finite element (FE) modelling is used to unravel the underlying material flow and deformation pattern during cold extrusion of commercial purity aluminium. It is shown that the plastic work within the shear deformation zone of the workpiece constitutes about 60 % of the total forming load, the remaining being the result of friction, upsetting and plane strain compression. Because of this shear deformation the divergent extrusion process bears a close resemblance to equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). In Part III the aptness of the divergent extrusion process in simulating cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding</b> (CPW) is further documented and explored. As a starting point, the situation existing both prior to and after cold bonding is adequately reproduced using finite element (FE) modelling. Combined extrusion and joining experiments are then carried out to unravel the conditions under which cold bonding takes place in commercial purity aluminium. Based on three-point bend testing and fracture surface investigations in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), it is observed that bond initiation occurs gradually {{during the course of the}} extrusion process. Full metallic bonding is achieved when the surface exposure, as determined by the x-component of the strain acting in the extrusion direction, reaches a value of 0. 97. This surface exposure is comparable to that reported for bond formation using conventional CPW and cold roll bonding (CRB) in the presence of oxide and lubricant films at the mating interfaces under similar contact pressure conditions. Finally, Part IV is concerned with cold <b>pressure</b> <b>welding</b> (CPW) of severely plastically deformed (SPD) aluminium. As a starting point, commercially purity aluminium is subjected to single pass equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and subsequently joined by divergent extrusion (DIE). The mechanical integrity of the spliced components is then documented using notch tensile testing, showing that both the strength and the flow properties of the SPD processed base material are fully maintained across the joint after cold welding. This is because the DIE process implies a mixed deformation mode, i. e. homogenous shear deformation in the bulk and plain strain compression at the joint line where bonding occurs. Moreover, finite element (FE) modelling reveals that the combination of contact pressure to yield strength ratio and surface exposure needed to achieve full metallic bonding is comparable with that reported for bond formation in soft annealed aluminium. This means that SPD processing by ECAP does not alter the conditions under which bonding takes place during CPW, which makes the DIE method particularly useful for joining such materials.
