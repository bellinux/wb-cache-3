50|$|The <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> {{refrigerator}} (PTR) or <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocooler is {{a developing}} technology that emerged {{largely in the}} early 1980s {{with a series of}} other innovations in the broader field of thermoacoustics. In contrast with other cryocoolers (e.g. Stirling cryocooler and GM-refrigerators), this cryocooler can be made without moving parts in the low temperature part of the device, making the cooler suitable {{for a wide variety of}} applications.|$|E
50|$|W. E. Gifford and R. C. Longsworth, in the 1960s, {{invented the}} {{so-called}} Basic <b>Pulse</b> <b>Tube</b> Refrigerator. The modern PTR {{was invented by}} Mikulin by introducing orifice in Basic <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> in 1984. He reached a temperature of 105 K. Soon after that, PTRs became better due to the invention of new variations. This {{is shown in figure}} 3, where the lowest temperature for PTRs is plotted as a function of time.|$|E
40|$|Cryocoolers offer a {{convenient}} means of cooling where thermal loads are relatively small, particularly where bath cooling {{is not required}} and the load may be attached directly to the cold head. Depending {{on the type of}} cooler and number of stages, temperatures of 4 K and below may be reached. Unlike either Gifford-McMahon (G-M) or Stirling coolers, <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> have no active components operating at low temperature, and therefore offer the potential of high reliability together with an absolute minimum of microphonics at the cold station. The simplicity of <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> also means that they could probably be produced at relatively low cost if sufficient demand existed. Applications already being considered include the cooling of processor chips and other semiconductor devices, but <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> obviously hold considerable potential in high temperature superconductor (HTS) device applications...|$|R
40|$|In the work, {{non-destructive}} testing the Si and Ge semiconductors by pulse X-ray sources is discussed. Mathematical simulation of the radiation generation in reflection and transmission anode tubes is performed. Details of energy spectrum formation in these <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> are analyzed, and its transformation when passing through thin samples of semiconductor materials is discussed. The {{dependence of the}} amount of radiation absorbed by the samples on the amplitude of acceleration voltage is calculated. It is shown how the pulse operation regime and design features of <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> influence the characteristics of the X-ray radiation...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the flight}} time was so short the soldier wore no special flight gear, each simply wore the {{standard}} Feldbluse, and were armed with standard infantry weapons and two Stielhandgranates for deploying though the open tops of enemy vehicles, occupied buildings, groups of infantry or other opportune targets while in flight above them. The unit consumed fuel rapidly, so {{had to be}} {{turned off by the}} operator as soon as landing. Because of the heavy consumption of fuel, the user was restricted in the speed they could travel at [...] Both rockets had to be operated simultaneously to work, the smaller rocket in front having controls for piloting. Schmidt paired the two pulse jets so the thrust from the larger pulsejet, worn on the back, created a thrust vector that thrusted its force through the centre of the mass of the whole [...] "vehicle". This prevented it from [...] "tumbling" [...] and kept the vehicle stable and on its intended trajectory. The smaller pulsejet utilised enough force only to control direction. Both of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> were angled away from the operator's body. In operation, the thrust difference between <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> had a stabilising push/pull/lift effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of adequate modulators for high peak power klystrons {{is one of}} the focus points for linear col-lider R & D programs. For the DESY/THD S-band linear collider study 150 MW RF pulse power at 50 Hz repetition rate and 3 s pulse duration is required. Two different mod-ulator schemes were investigated. One is the conventional line type pulser, using a pulse forming network and a step up transformer, the other one is a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser,</b> using a DC power source at the full klystron voltage and a switch tube. The Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser,</b> which switches the high voltage directly from a storage capacitor to the klystron, should of-fer a simpler design and a better pulse quality than a con-ventional line type pulser. A 25 MW RF power test version of a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser</b> has been built up and tested at DESY. Circuitry and the results of the tests are reported. In addi-tion to the tests theoretical investigations were carried out about a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser</b> for a klystron delivering 150 MW RF power. The results of these studies are presented. Fi-nally the efficiencies of a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser</b> and a line type pulser for a 150 MW klystron are compared. 1 THE PRINCIPLE OF A HARD TUBE PULSER As an alternative to conventional modulators Hard Tube Pulsers have to be considered as a HV source for high power pulsed klystrons. The main advantages of a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser</b> are short rise and fall times of the HV pulse, resulting in high efficiency. The investment cost for a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser</b> is comparable to the cost for a conventional modulator. Figure 1 shows the basic circuitry of a Hard <b>Tube</b> <b>Pulser.</b> r r...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Because of {{bilateral}} <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes,</b> wave rotor refrigerators (WRRs) have excellent fluidic operation performance. In this work, a WRR experimental rig with throughput of 3 × 104 Nm 3 /d and expansion ratio 3 for hydrated gases has been built. A number of experiments {{show that the}} temperature of low pressure port of WRR has little influence on refrigeration efficiency. This makes possible of maintaining excellent refrigeration efficiency when WRR operating with high-liquid gases. Actual liquid experiments do show the excellent fluidic operation performance: the refrigeration performance remains almost unchanged even if WWR operates with 13. 7 % (w) liquid ratio...|$|R
40|$|A new three-stage {{pulse-tube}} refrigerator (PTR) {{is developed}} by scaling down a previous PTR by 50 %. The new system is small {{in size and}} weight, capable of operating using little input power, and uses {{a small amount of}} working gas and regenerator material. In addition to that the system is flexible and convenient for modifications. The volume of the low-temperature part of the new PTR (<b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> + regenerator) is as small as 0. 281.

50|$|The thermal {{environment}} {{of a gas}} element near X2, that moves {{back and forth in}} the system, changes when it passes the heat exchanger. In the regenerator and in the heat exchanger the heat contact between the gas and its surrounding material is good. Here the temperature of the gas is practically the same as of the surrounding medium. However, in the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> the gas element is thermally isolated (adiabatic), so, in the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube,</b> the temperature of the gas elements vary with the pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We give here {{an update}} on the CUORE {{cryogenic}} system. It consists of a large cryogen-free cryostat cooled by five <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> and one high-power specially designed dilution refrigerator built by Leiden Cryogenics. The cryostat design has been completed and it is presently under construction. The site at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory is ready for the installation of the cryostat which is expected to begin by the end of 2009. We discuss here the preliminary results obtained on the performance of the mechanical cryorefrigerators.

40|$|Pulse {{detonation}} engines (PDE) {{have been}} investigated as a more efficient means of propulsion due to its constant volume combustion rather than the more often used constant pressure combustion of other propulsion systems. It has been proposed that a hybrid PDE-gas turbine engine would be a feasible means of improving {{the efficiency of the}} typical constant pressure combustion gas turbine cycle. In this proposed system, multiple <b>pulse</b> detonation <b>tubes</b> would replace the conventional combustor. Also, some of the compressor stages may be removed due to the pressure rise gained across the detonation wave. The benefits of higher thermal efficiency and reduced compressor size may come at a cost. The first question that arises is the unsteadiness in the flow created by the <b>pulse</b> detonation <b>tubes.</b> A constant pressure combustor has the advantage of supplying a steady and large mass flow rate. The use of the <b>pulse</b> detonation <b>tubes</b> will create an unsteady mass flow which will have currently unknown effects on the turbine located downstream of the combustor. Using multiple <b>pulse</b> detonation <b>tubes</b> will hopefully improve the unsteadiness. The interaction between the turbine and the shock waves exiting the tubes will also have an unknown effect. Noise levels are also a concern with this hybrid system. These unknown effects are being investigated using TURBO, an unsteady turbomachinery flow simulation code developed at Mississippi State University. A baseline case corresponding to a system using a constant pressure combustor with the same mass flow rate achieved with the pulse detonation hybrid system will be investigated first...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Boston Biomedica Inc., (BBI) has {{developed}} a proprietary Pres-sure Cycling Technology (PCT) based Sample Preparation System (PCT SPS) that utilizes a specially designed instrument (BarocyclerTM) and reac-tion containers (PULSETM Tubes) to apply cycles of hydrostatic pressure to samples. The initial application of the PCT SPS is to liberate molecules {{from a variety of}} biological samples, including animal and plant tissues, mi-crobes, and cultured cells. The typical extraction process is accomplished in five minutes or less with as few as five cycles of pressure ranging between atmospheric and 235 MPa. The lysate can then be withdrawn from the <b>PULSE</b> <b>Tubes</b> for downstream analysis, further processing or storage for fu-ture use.

5000|$|Modern {{dilution}} refrigerators can precool the 3He with a cryocooler {{in place}} of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and a 1 K bath. No external supply of cryogenic liquids is needed in these [...] "dry cryostats" [...] and operation can be highly automated. However, dry cryostats have high energy requirements and are subject to mechanical vibrations, such as those produced by <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> refrigerators. The first experimental machines {{were built in the}} 1990s, when (commercial) cryocoolers became available, capable of reaching a temperature lower than that of liquid helium and having sufficient cooling power (on the order of 1 watt at 4.2 K). <b>Pulse</b> <b>tube</b> coolers are commonly used cryocoolers in dry dilution refrigerators.|$|E

5000|$|Requires {{cryogenic}} cooling. Traditionally {{this has}} been achieved using cryogenic liquids such as liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. More recently, closed-cycle cryocoolers, e.g., <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> refrigerators have gained considerable popularity as they eliminate cryogenic liquids which are both costly and require periodic refilling. Cryogenic cooling is also an advantage since it reduces the working environment's thermal noise.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{increasing}} cost and the dwindling availability of liquid helium, many superconducting systems are cooled using two stage mechanical refrigeration. In general {{two types of}} mechanical cryocoolers are employed which have sufficient cooling power to maintain magnets below their critical temperature. The Gifford-McMahon Cryocooler has been commercially available since the 1960s and has found widespread application. The G-M regenerator cycle in a cryocooler operates using a piston type displacer and heat exchanger. Alternatively, 1999 marked the first commercial application using a <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocooler. This design of cryocooler has become increasingly common due to low vibration and long service interval as <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> designs utilize an acoustic process in lieu of mechanical displacement. Typical to two stage refrigerators the first stage will offer higher cooling capacity but at higher temperature ~77 K with the second stage being at ~4.2 K and <2.0 Watts cooling power. In use, the first stage is used primarily for ancillary cooling of the cryostat with the second stage used primarily for cooling the magnet.|$|E
50|$|Cryogenic cooling {{of devices}} and {{material}} is usually achieved via {{the use of}} liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, or a mechanical cryocooler (which uses high pressure helium lines). Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers, <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers and Stirling cryocoolers are in wide use with selection based on required base temperature and cooling capacity. The most recent development in cryogenics {{is the use of}} magnets as regenerators as well as refrigerators. These devices work on the principle known as the magnetocaloric effect.|$|E

Each polarimeter consists of a refracting telescope (to minimise systematics) cooled by a <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cooler to 4 K, and a focal-plane array of 512 transition edge sensors cooled to 250 mK, giving a total of 2560 detectors, or 1280 dual-polarization pixels.|$|E

50|$|The JWST crycooler {{is based}} {{originally}} on the TRW ACTDP cryocooler. However, the JWST {{has had to}} develop a version to handle higher thermal loads. It has a multi-stage <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> refrigerator that chills an even more powerful cooler. That is a linear-motion Oxford-style compressor that powers a J-T loop. Its target is to cool the MIRI instrument down to 6 kelvin (-448.87 F or -267.15 C). The ISIM is at about 40k (due to the sunshield) {{and there is a}} dedicated MIRI radiation shield beyond which the temperature is 20 k. The J-T loop is a Joule-Thomson Loop heat exchanger.|$|E
40|$|The {{cooling power}} of cryocoolers is {{determined}} by the work done by the compressor and the entropy produced by the irreversible processes in the various components of the system. In this paper we discuss the thermodynamics of <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes,</b> but many of the relationships are equally valid for other cryocoolers such as Stirling or Gifford-McMahon coolers. First general equations will be derived staying {{as close as possible to}} first principles, i. e. the first and second law of thermodynamics. General estimations of the entropy productions are made and the consequences for the design of coolers are discussed. No assumptions are made with respect to the nature of the gas and the relationships are valid for large pressure variations. Much attention is paid to reversible and irreversible processes in the regenerator. The energy balance equations lead to a characteristic length and a characteristic time. In the case of ideal heat exchange between the gas and the matrix the equations imply solutions in which the temperature profile moves through the regenerator as a wave...|$|R
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current <b>pulse.</b> Vacuum <b>tubes</b> use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|R
40|$|Single stage cryocoolers {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to reach temperatures as low as ~ 20 K without a load. To reach even lower temperatures or to have cooling at more than one temperature, multistage cryocoolers (MSCs) are often used. There are various types of MSCs, e. g., multistage Stirling, <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes,</b> Gifford-McMahon and reverse Brayton cryocoolers, etc. One of the disadvantages of multistage cryocoolers is known as load-shifting. For example, a two-stage cryocooler {{that is designed to}} operate between two temperatures has very little capability to shift the cooling load from one stage to another if the operating condition is {{different from that of the}} design point. This paper offers a new concept for multistage cryocoolers by connecting two different stages of the MSC with a tube / orifice or an inertance tube as potential phase shifting devices. Using a two-stage Stirling cryocooler as an example, these phase shift devices have been found to provide far bigger load shifting capability than the basic two-stage Stirling cryocooler. This new concept also helps to increase the cooling capacity at each stage (as much as 30 % on the second stage at 35 K in the current study) ...|$|R
