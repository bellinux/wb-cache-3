40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Nepalese industrial {{labour market}} using macroeconomic data and explores {{a strategy for}} poverty reduction along with the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> women. It concludes that basic poverty indices for Nepal are highly dependent on the capital labour ratio (CLR) and {{the growth rate of}} wages in the industrial sector. Moreover, the growth <b>of</b> women's <b>employment</b> in manufacturing industries supports the reduction of the poverty gap (PG) and income inequality among the poor as well as among the whole population. Furthermore, the two major Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), poverty reduction and the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> women's <b>employment</b> in the industrial sector, are proved complementary to each other.
