Patients with sex-linked congenital hypogammaglobulinaemia have values for mononuclear cell 5 '-nucleotidase activity which are in the normal range, whereas most cases of non-familial adult onset `variable' primary hypogammaglobulinaemia have clearly subnormal values. The three patients with isolated IgA deficiency who were tested also had subnormal values. Evidence that the measured enzyme activity is in fact 5 '-nucleotidase and independent of interfering phosphatase activities is presented. No significant or consistent alterations in the activities of the following enzymes were detected in mononuclear cells or erythrocytes: adenosine deaminase, <b>purine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> (inosine) <b>phosphorylase,</b> hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase.

40|$|Purine {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia psittaci AA Mp in the wild type {{and a variety of}} mutant host cell lines with well-defined deficiencies in purine metabolism. C. psittaci AA Mp cannot synthesize purines de novo, as assessed by its inability to incorporate exogenous glycine into nucleic acid purines. C. psittaci AA Mp can take ATP and GTP, but not dATP or dGTP, directly from the host cell. Exogenous hypoxanthine and inosine were not utilized by the parasite. In contrast, exogenous adenine, adenosine, and guanine were directly salvaged by C. psittaci AA Mp. Crude extract prepared from highly purified C. psittaci AA Mp reticulate bodies contained adenine and guanine but no hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Adenosine kinase activity was detected, but guanosine kinase activity was not. There was no competition for incorporation into nucleic acid between adenine and guanine, and high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of radiolabelled nucleic acid nucleobases indicated that adenine, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine were incorporated only into adenine and that guanine, guanosine, and deoxyguanosine were incorporated only into guanine. Thus, there is no interconversion of nucleotides.

40|$|The {{activity}} of three enzymes {{involved in the}} salvage pathway of <b>purine</b> nucleosides-purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> (PNP), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), an hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) -was investigated in cellular fractions of the chicken bursa of Fabricius differentially enriched in epithelial cells or lymphocytes. Markedly increasing levels of PNP and XDH were observed along with the enrichment in epithelial cells together with a slight, though significant, decrease in HGPRT activity. By contrast, a dramatic fall in PNP and XDH activities was detected along with the enrichment in lymphocytes together with a slight, though significant, increase in HGPRT activity. This sharply different distribution of the three enzymes, all sharing hypoxanthine as a substrate, clearly indicates that lymphocytes preferentially channel hypoxanthine into the salvage and interconversion pathways, phosphorylating it to IMP, while epithelial cells rapidly catabolize such a purine base to uric acid. Moreover, epithelial cells, unlike lymphocytes, are able to retain high intracellular levels of both hypoxanthine and inosine. These results support the possibility that epithelial cells contribute to the normal development of bursal lymphocytes by supplying such actively proliferating cells with purine rings {{and at the same}} time by preventing them from accumulating potentially toxic high levels of purine nucleotides being able to rapidly eliminate excess hypoxanthine as uric acid from the bursa environment into the bloodstream...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Our {{earlier work}} on reperfusion showed that adult rat hearts {{released}} {{almost twice as}} much <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> and oxypurines as newborn hearts did [Am J Physiol 254 (1988) H 1091]. A change in the ratio anabolism/catabolism of adenosine could be responsible for this effect. We therefore measured the activity of adenosine kinase, adenosine deaminase, <b>nucleoside</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> and xanthine oxidoreductase in homogenates of hearts and myocytes from neonatal and adult rats. In hearts the activity of adenosine deaminase and <b>nucleoside</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> (10 – 20 U/g protein) changed relatively little. However, adenosine kinase activity decreased from 1. 3 to 0. 6 U/g (P < 0. 025), and xanthine oxidoreductase activity increased from 0. 02 to 0. 85 U/g (P < 0. 005). Thus the ratio in activity of these rate-limiting enzymes for anabolism and catabolism dropped from 68 to 0. 68 during cardiac development. In contrast, the ratio in myocytes remained unchanged (about 23). The large difference in adenosine anabolism/catabolism ratio, observed in heart homogenates, could explain why ATP breakdown due to hypoxia is lower in neonatal than in adult heart. Because this change is absent in myocytes, we speculate that mainly endothelial activities of adenosine kinase and xanthine oxidoreductase are responsible for this shift in purine metabolism during development...|$|R

The β-l-pyrimidine nucleosides, β-l-uridine, β-l-cytidine, and β-l-thymidine, were not transported. The uptake of NBMPR and the nonphysiological <b>purine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> β-l-enantiomers by the intracellular parasites also implies that Toxoplasma-infected cells can transport these nucleosides. In sharp contrast, under the same conditions, uninfected fibroblast cells did not transport NBMPR or any of the unnatural β-l-nucleosides. β-d-Adenosine and dipyridamole, another inhibitor of nucleoside transport, inhibited the uptake of NBMPR and β-l-stereoisomers of the <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> by intracellular Toxoplasma and Toxoplasma-infected cells. Furthermore, infection with a Toxoplasma mutant deficient in parasite adenosine/purine nucleoside transport reduced or abolished the uptake of β-d-adenosine, NBMPR, and purine β-l-nucleosides. Hence, the presence of the Toxoplasma adenosine/purine nucleoside transporters is apparently essential for the uptake of NBMPR and purine β-l-nucleosides by intracellular Toxoplasma and Toxoplasma-infected cells. These results also demonstrate that, in contrast to the mammalian nucleoside transporters, the Toxoplasma adenosine/purine nucleoside transporter(s) lacks stereospecificity and substrate specificity in the transport of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides.</b> In addition, infection with T. gondii confers the properties of the parasite's <b>purine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> transport on the parasitized host cells and enables the infected cells to transport <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> that were not transported by uninfected cells.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} on erythrocyte preserva-tion (1 - 4) {{have demonstrated}} a marked effect of <b>purine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> on the metabolism {{of the red}} cell throughout storage. Attention has been fo-cused upon the effect of adenosine in the mainte-nance of glucose metabolism and of high energy phosphate compounds, such as adenosine triphos-phate (ATP). As a result, {{not only are the}} physical and chemical characteristics of the eryth-rocyte preserved, but the storage period, during which satisfactory post-transfusion viability is maintained, is extended to approximately twice that observed in acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) pre-servative alone. It was postulated that the effect of adenosine was the result of an initial enzymatic conversion to inosine by a deaminase and the sub-sequent splitting of inosine to yield hypoxanthine and ribose-l-phosphate, mediated by a <b>nucleoside</b> <b>phosphorylase</b> (4, 5). Thus, it appeared that ino-sine might be the actual substrate for the initial enzymic reaction, and hence the preferred sub-stance for viability studies. In order to evaluate a new preservative, it is desirable to correlate 1) the chemical characteristics of the stored red cells, 2) the ability of the cells to survive after transfu-sion, and 3) possible toxic effects of the preserva-tive.
