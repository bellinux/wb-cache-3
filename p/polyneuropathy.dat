5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute <b>polyneuropathy.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate and extent of recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy,</b> which is treated differently.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, <b>polyneuropathy,</b> alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} anti-GM 1 titres are raised in <b>polyneuropathies</b> of unknown origin and whether determination of these titres is useful for diagnosing these conditions. The study population comprised 20 controls (aged 36 - 88 years), 12 patients with <b>polyneuropathies</b> of known origin (aged 31 - 81 years) and 15 patients with <b>polyneuropathies</b> of unknown origin (aged 40 - 77 years). Antibody levels were measured using a commercial GM 1 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit (Buehlmann Laboratories). Mean anti-GM 1 IgG and IgM antibody titres were not raised in patients with <b>polyneuropathies</b> of unknown origin. Anti-GM 1 IgG antibody titres were raised in one and GM 1 IgM antibody titres in none of the patients with <b>polyneuropathies</b> of unknown origin. In conclusion, GM 1 antibody levels are rarely raised in <b>polyneuropathies</b> of unknown origin and probably play a minor role in the pathogenesis of these conditions...|$|R

25|$|<b>Polyneuropathy</b> is a {{collection}} of peripheral nerve disorders that often are breed-related in dogs. <b>Polyneuropathy</b> indicates that multiple nerves are involved, unlike mononeuropathy. <b>Polyneuropathy</b> usually involves motor nerve dysfunction, also known as lower motor neuron disease.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of symptoms associated with alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson {{has also been}} credited with describing <b>polyneuropathy</b> in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the <b>polyneuropathy</b> was {{a direct result of}} the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the <b>polyneuropathy</b> resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|The {{percentage}} {{and cause}} of neuromuscular (NM) diseases have been analysed during a 15 -year period of time. A NM disorder {{was found in}} 10, 852 patients (or 14. 4 % of all neurological patients seen in our hospital). Mononeuropathies {{have been the most}} common causes, followed by <b>polyneuropathies</b> and radiculopathies, but with a variable percentage during time for the most frequent causes, that were carpal tunnel syndrome and diabetic <b>polyneuropathies.</b> Myopathies, diseases of the neuromuscular junction and anterior horn cell disorders counted for 5 % among all NM disorders during the first 10 years (1 % of all neurological patients) and for 12 % during the last 5 years (2. 4 % of all neurological patients), this period corresponds to the opening of our outpatient clinic dedicated to NM diseases. Among <b>polyneuropathies,</b> the most common causes were diabetes mellitus, chronic inflammatory demyelinating <b>polyneuropathies</b> and the inherited forms of peripheral neuropathies. Among myopathies, the most frequently reported symptom was exercise-induced myalgia. The 2 most common muscular dystrophies (MD) were Steinert myotonic MD, and facio-scapulo-humeral MD. Other myopathies were rare, but of diverse causes, all of them corresponding to the newly introduced definition of Rare or Orphan Diseases...|$|R

25|$|The rate of {{incidence}} of alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> involving sensory and motor <b>polyneuropathy</b> varies from 10% to 50% of alcoholics {{depending on the}} subject selection and diagnostic criteria. If electrodiagnostic criteria is used, alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> {{may be found in}} up to 90% of individuals being assessed. The distribution and severity the disease depends on regional dietary habits, individual drinking habits, as well as an individual’s genetics. Large studies have been conducted and show that alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> severity and incidence correlates best with the total lifetime consumption of alcohol. Factors such as nutritional intake, age, or other medical conditions are correlate in lesser degrees. For unknown reasons, alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> has a high incidence in women.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that providing individuals with adequate vitamins improves symptoms despite continued alcohol intake, indicating that vitamin deficiency may be {{a major factor in}} the development and progression of alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy.</b> In experimental models of alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy</b> utilizing rats and monkeys has not resulted in convincing evidence that proper nutritional intake along with alcohol results in <b>polyneuropathy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (CIDP) is an immunological demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy.</b> As {{a result}} of increased paranodal capacitance from demyelination, patients experience increased stimulation threshold, shorter strength-duration time constant, and increased rheobase.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{relative}} diagnostic sensitivity of various F wave parameters.  METHODS—Normal values for minimum, mean, and maximum F wave latency, chronodispersion, and persistence {{in the four}} major motor nerves were established and systematically applied to at least four separate categories of patients (radiculopathies, <b>polyneuropathies,</b> mononeuropathies, and others). F Waves were studied both isolated and in comparison with other motor nerve conduction parameters.  RESULTS—F Chronodispersion was the most often abnormal parameter, particularly in lumbosacral radiculopathies. Minimum F wave latency was more useful in <b>polyneuropathies.</b> Compared with minimum F wave latency, F chronodispersion was able to identify most additional cases.  CONCLUSIONS—F Wave studies should include minimum F wave latency and chronodispersion. ...|$|R

25|$|In addition, the {{consumption}} of alcohol {{may lead to the}} buildup of certain toxins in the body. For example, in the process of breaking down alcohol, the body produces acetaldehyde, which can accumulate to toxic levels in alcoholics. This suggests that there is a possibility ethanol (or its metabolites) may cause alcoholic <b>polyneuropathy.</b> There is evidence that <b>polyneuropathy</b> is also prevalent in well nourished alcoholics, supporting {{the idea that there is}} a direct toxic effect of alcohol.|$|E

40|$|Axonal <b>polyneuropathies</b> are a {{frequent}} cause of progressive disability in the elderly. Common etiologies comprise diabetes mellitus, paraproteinaemia, and inflammatory disorders, but often {{the underlying causes}} remain elusive. Late-onset axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT 2) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited condition that manifests {{in the second half}} of life and is genetically largely unexplained. We assumed age-dependent penetrance of mutations in a so far unknown gene causing late-onset CMT 2. We screened 51 index case subjects with late-onset CMT 2 for mutations by whole-exome (WES) and Sanger sequencing and subsequently queried WES repositories for further case subjects carrying mutations in the identified candidate gene. We studied nerve pathology and tissue levels and function of the abnormal protein in order to explore consequences of the mutations. Altogether, we observed heterozygous rare loss-of-function and missense mutations in MME encoding the metalloprotease neprilysin in 19 index case subjects diagnosed with axonal <b>polyneuropathies</b> or neurodegenerative conditions involving the peripheral nervous system. MME mutations segregated in an autosomal-dominant fashion with age-related incomplete penetrance and some affected individuals were isolated case subjects. We also found that MME mutations resulted in strongly decreased tissue availability of neprilysin and impaired enzymatic activity. Although neprilysin is known to degrade β-amyloid, we observed no increased amyloid deposition or increased incidence of dementia in individuals with MME mutations. Detection of MME mutations is expected to increase the diagnostic yield in late-onset <b>polyneuropathies,</b> and it will be tempting to explore whether substances that can elevate neprilysin activity could be a rational option for treatment...|$|R
