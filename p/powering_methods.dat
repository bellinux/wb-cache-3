40|$|AbstractA {{meaningful}} rank as well {{as efficient}} methods for computing such a rank are necessary {{in many areas of}} applications. Major methodologies for ranking often exploit principal eigenvectors. Kleinberg’s HITS model is one of such methodologies. The standard approach for computing the HITS rank is the <b>power</b> <b>method.</b> Unlike the PageRank calculations where many acceleration schemes have been proposed, relatively few works on accelerating HITS rank calculation exist. This is mainly because the <b>power</b> <b>method</b> often works quite well in the HITS setting. However, there are cases where the <b>power</b> <b>method</b> is ineffective, moreover, a systematic acceleration over the <b>power</b> <b>method</b> is desirable even when the <b>power</b> <b>method</b> works well. We propose a practical acceleration scheme for HITS rank calculations based on the filtered <b>power</b> <b>method</b> by adaptive Chebyshev polynomials. For cases where the gap-ratio is below 0. 85 for which the <b>power</b> <b>method</b> works well, our scheme is about twice faster than the <b>power</b> <b>method.</b> For cases where gap-ratio is unfavorable for the <b>power</b> <b>method,</b> our scheme can provide significant speedup. When the ranking problems are of very large scale, even a single matrix–vector product can be expensive, for which accelerations are highly necessary. The scheme we propose is desirable in that it provides consistent reduction in number of matrix–vector products {{as well as}} CPU time over the <b>power</b> <b>method,</b> with little memory overhead...|$|R

Traditional <b>powering</b> <b>methods</b> such as batteries and inductive power transfer cannot satisfy conflicting requirements of large penetration depth, omni-directionality, and small size for many emerging applications. For example batteries are still large and have limited lifetime; whereas, inductive powering does not scale {{well into the}} mm and sub-mm scale, has limited range, and suffers from severe alignment sensitivity (slight misalignment between the transmitter and receiver coils results in asignificant drop in the received power). The goal of this research has been to develop and characterize several implantable biomedical microdevices that utilize acoustic/ultrasonic wave as a power source or a control signal. Acoustic/ultrasonic wave offers deeper penetration depths, omni-directionality, better scaling at mm and sub-mm dimensions, and easier fabrication process.

Wireless embedded sensors monitoring system is also a promising solution for decreasing the high installation and maintenance cost of the conventional wire based monitoring systems. Wireless monitoring sensors need to operate for long time. However, sensor batteries have finite life-time. Therefore, in order to enable long operational life of wireless sensors, novel wireless <b>powering</b> <b>methods,</b> which can charge the sensors’ rechargeable batteries wirelessly, need to be developed. ^ The optimization of RF wireless powering of sensors embedded in concrete is studied here. First, our analytical results focus on calculating the transmission loss and propagation loss of electromagnetic waves penetrating into plain concrete at different humidity conditions for various frequencies. This analysis specifically leads to the identification of an optimum frequency range within 20 – 80 MHz that is validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Second, the effects of various reinforced bar configurations on the efficiency of wireless powering are investigated. Specifically, effects of the following factors are studied: rebar types, rebar period, rebar radius, depth inside concrete, and offset placement. This analysis leads to the identification of the 902 – 928 MHz ISM band as the optimum power transmission frequency range for sensors embedded in reinforced concrete, since antennas working in this band are less sensitive to the effects of varying humidity as well as rebar configurations. Finally, optimized rectennas are designed for receiving and/or harvesting power in order to charge the rechargeable batteries of the embedded sensors. Such optimized wireless powering systems exhibit significantly larger efficiencies than the efficiencies of conventional RF wireless powering systems for sensors embedded in plain or reinforced concrete. ...|$|E
