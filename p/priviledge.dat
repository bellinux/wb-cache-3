60|$|It is {{the great}} {{prerogative}} of Mankind above other Creatures, {{that we are not}} only able to behold the works of Nature, or barely to sustein our lives by them, but we have also the power of considering, comparing, altering, assisting, and improving them to various uses. And as this is the peculiar <b>priviledge</b> of humane Nature in general, so is it capable of being so far advanced by the helps of Art, and Experience, as to make some Men excel others in their Observations, and Deductions, almost as much as they do Beasts. By the addition of such artificial Instruments and methods, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self, by negligence, and intemperance, and a wilful and superstitious deserting the Prescripts and Rules of Nature, whereby every man, both from a deriv'd corruption, innate and born with him, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to slip into all sorts of errors.|$|E

[...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers.

[...] Furthermore, vessels that were transporting Chinese immigrants were permitted to only carry one Chinese immigrant per 50 tonnes of the ship's weight. This law also prevented any Chinese immigrants who suffered from a contagious disease such as leprosy or any Chinese woman who was known to have been a prostitute. Therefore, the Act limited the number of Chinese immigrants so much so that legally, a 300-ton ship could only carry 6 Chinese immigrants to Canada. Furthermore, despite mass fervor towards the banning of Chinese immigrants in 1885, due to Canada being a colony under Britain, the passing of Chinese exclusion would not be possible. This was because the banning of Chinese immigrants did not fall with British interests at the time.|$|E

50|$|The {{summer of}} 1642 brought {{the onset of}} the First English Civil War. Tamworth was soon under royalist {{occupation}} and was used a base for harassing parliamentarian forces during the fighting at Lichfield. It was taken by parliamentarians from Coventry under William Purefoy on 25 June 1643. In 1644 the town's garrison foiled a concerted royalist assault and it retained Tamwoth the end of the fighting, although until March 1646 it confronted a strong royalist garrison at Lichfield, with devastating consequences for the surrounding countryside. Blake was a strong supporter of parliament and it seems unlikely that he remained in Tamworth during the royalist occupation. His parish work must have been disrupted and it was during these years that he first made his mark as a controversialist. His published writings all focussed on the issue of infant baptism. In The Birth <b>Priviledge,</b> or, Covenant-Holinesse of Beleevers (1644) he defended the universal right to baptism against strict Calvinist exclusiveness, so long as the child's parents expressed visible penitence. Over the next two years he also published critiques of works by both Baptists and Presbyterians that upheld believer's baptism, including Two Treatises by John Tombes.|$|E
50|$|The {{influence}} of James Melville’s The Black Bastel, or A Lamentation {{in name of}} the Kirk of Scotland (written 1611, published in 1634) is unmistakable in Mure’s vehemently anti-episcopalian and anti-Laudian sonnet sequence The Joy of Teares, published in 1635: the numerous verbal and conceptual links between The Joy of Tears and The Black Bastel leap off the page. They range from references to Eli and the ‘captive ark’ and the ‘hungry souls’ fed by the incomparable pre-episcopal Kirk, to mentions of ‘dogs and swine’, ‘poperie’ and the mourning faithful. Melville’s image of the enslavement of the defiled Kirk by James VI and I and his bishops - ‘‘upon a royall Throne, / Did awfull sit … a rampand Lyon red … And round about him thirteen wolues did dance/ To keep her sheep’ - underlies Mure’s ‘woolfs that lams do chase’ in line 5 of his twelfth sonnet. By 1635, tensions had already risen very high between Charles I’s authoritarian, episcopal ‘Court of High Commission’ and the presbyterian opposition. Mure did not dare to name himself as author of The Joy of Teares. Instead, he stated on the title page that the book was ‘published with the gratious licence and <b>priviledge</b> of GOD Almighty, King of Heaven and Earth the penult day of Iuly, Anno Dom.1635’, and in a couplet following his opening sonnet to the reader, Mure wrote ‘No marvel I my name forbear/ Since blameless Truth dar scarce appear’.|$|E
5000|$|Early Methodists wore plain dress, with Methodist clergy condemning [...] "high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and 'costly apparel' in general". John Wesley, {{the founder}} the Methodist {{movement}} recommended that Methodists read his thoughts On Dress, {{in which he}} detailed acceptable types and colors of fabrics, in addition to [...] "shapes and sizes of hats, coats, sleeves, and hairstyles"; in that sermon, John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists: [...] "Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation." [...] Those who tried to attend Methodist services in costly apparel were denied admittance. The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection stated that [...] "we would not only ejoin on all who fear God plain dress, but we would recommend to our preachers and people, according to Mr. Wesley's views expressed in his sermon on the inefficiency of Christianity, published {{but a few years}} before his death, and containing his matured judgment, distinguishing plainness—Plainness which will publicly comment them to the maintenance of their Christian profession wherever they may be." [...] The 1859 novel Adam Bede portrayed the Methodist itinerant preacher, Dinah Morris, wearing plain dress, with the words [...] "I saw she was a Methodist, or Quaker, or something of that sort, by her dress". Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, lamented the decline of wearing plain dress among Methodists, stating: The Methodists in that early day dressed plain; attended their meetings faithfully, especially preaching, prayer and class meetings; they wore no jewelry, no ruffles; they would frequently walk three or four miles to class-meetings and home again, on Sundays; they would go thirty or forty miles to their quarterly meetings, and think it a glorious <b>priviledge</b> to meet their presiding elder, {{and the rest of the}} preachers. They could, nearly every soul of them, sing our hymns and spiritual songs. They religiously kept the Sabbath day: many of them abstained from dram-drinking, not because the temperance reformation was ever heard of in that day, but because it was interdicted in the General Rules of our Discipline. The Methodists of that day stood up and faced their preacher when they sung; they kneedled down in the public congregation as well as elsewhere, when the preacher said, [...] "Let us pray." [...] There was no standing among the members in time of prayer, especially the abominable practice of sitting down during that exercise was unknown among early Methodists. Parents did not allow their children to go to balls or plays; tey did not send them to dancing schools; they generally fasted once a week, and almost universally on Friday before each quarterly meeting. If the Methodists had dressed in the same [...] "superfluity of naughtiness" [...] then as they do now, there were very few even out of the Church that would have had any confidence in their religion. But O, how have things changed for the worse in this educational age of the world! While little, if not none, wear plain dress in mainline Methodism today, a few members of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, continue to dress plainly, also avoiding the wearing of jewelry (inclusive of wedding rings).|$|E
