5|$|Nineteen of {{the forty}} <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> the 4½-mile course; of the 21 who did not, two {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on the}} first circuit, reigniting debates over {{the safety of the}} event. Irish horse Ballabriggs won the race, securing the first-place prize money of £535,135 and a first Grand National win for trainer Donald McCain, Jr., the son of four-time winning trainer Ginger McCain. Owned by Trevor Hemmings, Ballabriggs was ridden by Irish jockey Jason Maguire and was sent off at odds of 14/1. The pairing completed the race in 9 minutes 1.2 seconds, the second-fastest time in Grand National history.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 and 2015 120,000 <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> a {{questionnaire}} on cognitive functions. Four {{of the tests}} were repeats of the initial assessment and two tests (symbol digit substitution and trail making) were new.|$|E
25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> the experiment.|$|E

25|$|McDaniel et al. (2004) further {{distinguished}} event-based prospective memory into immediate-execute {{tasks and}} delayed-execute tasks. Immediate-execute tasks involve a response {{as soon as}} a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances of a situation prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated that correct performance suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.|$|E
25|$|Support for the {{division}} of visual and spatial memory components is found through experiments using the dual-task paradigm. A {{number of studies have}} shown that the retention of visual shapes or colours (i.e., visual information) is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures or dynamic visual noise. Conversely, the retention of location (i.e., spatial information) is disrupted only by spatial tracking tasks, spatial tapping tasks, and eye movements. For example, <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> both the VPT and the Corsi Blocks Task in a selective interference experiment. During the retention interval of the VPT, the subject viewed irrelevant pictures (e.g., avant-garde paintings). The spatial interference task required participants to follow, by touching the stimuli, an arrangement of small wooden pegs which were concealed behind a screen. Both the visual and spatial spans were shortened by their respective interference tasks, confirming that the Corsi Blocks Task relates primarily to spatial working memory.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} learning mechanism {{has also}} been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated {{with one of those}} objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times {{over the course of the}} training trials; after the completion of the training trials, <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.|$|E

50|$|Two {{research}} studies have clearly demonstrated {{the positive effects}} of the RTA program. John Jay College of Criminal Justice's 2003 study with the NYS Department of Correctional Services showed that RTA participants had fewer infractions and spent fewer days in keeplock than a control group. A 2010 study conducted by SUNY Purchase and the NYS Department of Correctional Services concluded that RTA <b>participants</b> <b>complete</b> the GED earlier in their incarceration, more RTA <b>participants</b> <b>complete</b> educational programs beyond the GED, and that after joining RTA, participants spent an almost three-fold increase in time enrolled in post-GED courses {{than those who did not}} participate.|$|R

[...] Embodied rapport would be demonstrated by pairs of same-sex strangers using Aron’s paradigm, which instructs participants to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose. The researchers predicted that participants would mimic each other’s movements, reflecting embodied cognition. Half the <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> a control task of reading and editing a scientific article, while half the <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> a shortened version of Aron’s self-disclosure paradigm.|$|E

50|$|In another study, {{researchers}} {{compared the}} effects of overlearning and distributed practice on mathematics knowledge. Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, {{no differences were found}} between three-problem and nine-problem participants. Researchers found no effect of overlearning on mathematics retention.|$|E

Half of the <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> a values list self-affirmation manipulation prior to reading the article. After reading the article <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> questions about how much they believed {{in the relationship between}} caffeine intake and breast cancer and how much they planned on reducing their own caffeine intake. Results showed that for non-affirmed participants, heavy coffee drinkers were less accepting of the article’s argument than the non-coffee drinkers. However, for the affirmed participants, the heavy coffee drinkers were more accepting of the article’s argument than the non-coffee drinkers.|$|E
