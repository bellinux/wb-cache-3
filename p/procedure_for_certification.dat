5000|$|On 9 April 2002 ECHR has {{delivered}} a unanimous judgment. The Court emphasised that {{the validity of}} the applicant's certificate was never questioned by the Latvian authorities. It further noted that it was issued to the applicant after an examination organised by a board composed of five examiners. The Court noted that [...] "the procedure followed differed fundamentally from the normal <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>certification</b> of linguistic competence, which is governed by the above-mentioned regulation of 25 May 1992. In particular, the additional verification to which the applicant was subjected was carried out by one examiner instead of a board of experts and the examiner was not required to observe the procedural safeguards and assessment criteria laid down in the regulation. Thus the full responsibility for assessing the applicant's linguistic knowledge was left to a single civil servant, who had exorbitant power in the matter. Moreover, the Court can only express its surprise over the fact - related by the applicant and not disputed by the Government - that during the examination the applicant was questioned mainly about the reasons for her political orientation" [...] (see para. 36).|$|E

However, while certification programs have become more widespread in recent years, little is known about persons who have become certified, their employers (whether private, government, or non-profit) or the position titles they hold. This paper investigates GIS certification programs in the U. S. and abroad using data from certification registries. The analysis reveals the broad appeal of the Geographic Information System Professional (GISP) certification, even among persons certified by other organizations such as the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS). Along with providing a comparison of certification programs, the role of higher education is discussed in the context of efforts to move from portfolio-based <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> evaluating <b>certification</b> applicants to competency-based systems that utilize an examination component...|$|R
