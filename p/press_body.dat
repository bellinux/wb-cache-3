40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop and validate a one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) prediction model for the upper and the lower body in non-resistance trained women. METHODS: Sixty seven healthy, non-resistance trained {{women between the ages of}} 18 and 25 years volunteered for this investigation. The investigation was performed in 2 phases. During phase I, all subjects completed 2 experimental sessions. During the first session, subjects performed a bench press repetition to fatigue (RTF) test with 45 lb and 55 lb. Subjects also performed a leg press RTF with 175 lb and 215 lb. Additional variables that were measured were: body height (in.), body weight (lb), and sum of skinfolds (mm). During the second session, subjects performed a 1 -RM bench press and a 1 -RM leg press. Phase II of the experiment involved the development and validation of 1 -RM prediction models for the bench press and the leg press exercise. RESULTS: A stepwise regression analysis was carried out to develop a 1 -RM prediction model for the bench press exercise and for the leg press exercise. The initial set of predictor variables considered for the upper body prediction model were: RTF with the bench <b>press,</b> <b>body</b> height (in.), body weight (lb), and sum of skinfolds (mm). The variable selected by the stepwise regression analysis for inclusion in the bench press prediction model was RTF with 55 lb (r = 0. 914). The model to predict 1 -RM bench press was: Model I: 1 -RM bench press = 56. 199 + 1. 94 (RTF 55). A paired samples t-test indicated that the difference between the mean measured and mean predicted 1 -RM was not significant (p>. 05). The correlation between the measured and the predicted 1 -RM values for the bench press was r = 0. 935. The initial set of predictor variables considered for the lower body prediction model were: RTF with the leg <b>press,</b> <b>body</b> height (in.), body weight (lb), and sum of skinfolds (mm). The variables selected by the stepwise regression analysis for inclusion in the leg press prediction model were RTF with 215 lb and body weight (lb) (r = 0. 798). The model to predict 1 -RM leg press was: Model II: 1 -RM leg press = 145. 099 + 2. 752 (RTF 215) +. 618 (body weight). A paired samples t-test indicated that the difference between the mean measured and mean predicted 1 -RM was not significant (p>. 05). The correlation between the measured and the predicted 1 -RM values for the leg press was r = 0. 695. CONCLUSION: The models developed in this investigation can be used to estimate the upper and/or lower body 1 -RM strength of non-resistance trained women. These models will be useful for coaches, personal trainers, and fitness professionals who wish to design strength-training programs to enhance performance and the health-fitness levels of recreationally active females...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{condensed}} multiple-set resistance training and circuit multiple-set resistance training on muscular strength, endurance, body composition and arm and thigh circumference in healthy males. Twenty seven healthy males volunteered to participate in this study and assigned into three groups; according to; condensed multiple-set group (COM; n= 9), circuit multiple-set group (CIM; n= 8) and control group (CON; n= 10). Subjects in the COM performed resistance training exercises for 3 sets continuously; whereas subjects in the CIM performed resistance training program for 1 set of each exercise and come back to the first exercise and this approach was performed 3 times each training session. Pre and post 8 weeks of training, one repetition maximum (1 RM) and muscle endurance (60 % of 1 RM) for leg press and bench <b>press,</b> <b>body</b> weight, arm and thigh circumference and body composition were measured. No significant differences in body mass, arm and thigh circumference and muscular strength for the bench press exercise were observed for any group during the 8 weeks of training period (p > 0. 05). A significant increase in muscular strength for the leg press exercise was observed for COM after 8 weeks of training (p < 0. 05). Both the COM and CIM groups showed significant improvement compared with pre training and CON in muscular endurance for the bench press and leg press exercises (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, it can be recommended that, COM is better for improving muscle strength and both training programs are proper for increasing muscular endurance...|$|E

Includes bibliographical references. A car {{passes through}} <b>press,</b> <b>body</b> shell, {{painting}} and assembly stages during its manufacturing process. Due {{to the increased}} competition among car manufacturers, they aim to continuously advance and improve their processes. In this study, we analyze planning operations {{for the production of}} front/back and left/right doors in body shell department of Bursa Oyak-Renault factory and propose heuristic algorithms to improve their planning processes. In this study, we present four different mathematical models and two heuristics approaches which decrease the current costs of the company particularly with respect to inventory carrying and setup perspectives. In the body shell department of the company, there are two parallel manufacturing cells which produces doors to be assembled on the consumption line. The effective planning and scheduling of the jobs on these lines requires solving the problem of integrated machine-scheduling and inventory planning subject to inclusive eligibility constraints and sequence independent setup times with job availability in flexible manufacturing cells of the body shell department. The novelty in the models lie in the integration of inventory planning and production scheduling decisions with the aim of streamlining operations of the door manufacturing cells with the consumption line. One of the proposed heuristic approaches is Rolling Horizon Algorithm (RHA) which divides the planning horizon into sub-intervals and solves the problem by rolling the solutions through sub-intervals. The other proposed algorithm is Two-Pass Algorithm which divides the planning horizon into sub-intervals and solves each sub-problem in each sub-interval to optimality for two times by maintaining the starting and ending inventory levels feasible. These approaches are implemented with Gurobi optimization software and Java programming language and applied within a decision support system that supports daily planning activities.

No differences (pre- vs. post-training) in TBARS, creatine phosphokinase, urea, creatinine, body weight and height, body fat percentage, or upper muscular area were observed in any group. When compared to COT, GC group showed greater decrease in TAS (− 0. 51 ± 0. 36 vs. - 0. 02 ± 0. 50 mmol/l; p = 0. 0268), higher increase in 1 RM (8. 30 ± 2. 26 vs. 5. 29 ± 2. 36 kg; p = 0. 0209) and uric acid (2. 77 ± 1. 70 vs. 1. 00 ± 1. 03 mg/dl; p = 0. 0276). Conclusion We conclude that Cr monohydrate supplementation associated with a specific resistance program promoted a meaningful increase in muscle strength without inducing changes in body composition. The observed significant increase in uric acid and the decrease in TAS suggest that creatine supplementation, despite promoting acute effects on muscle strength improvement, might induce oxidative stress and decreases total antioxidant status of subjects. </p...|$|E
