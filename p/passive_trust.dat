40|$|This study {{determined}} {{whether a}} two-person exchange situation contained natural contingencies for trusting behavior or whether external contingencies were necessary. Pairs {{of college students}} worked matching-to-sample problems for money. On each trial there was one problem and the subjects determined which of them would solve it. Trusting behavior was defined as {{an increase in the}} number of consecutive problems each subject allowed his partner to work during sessions that also ended with an equitable distribution. Simply, trust was a temporary deviation from equity. A subject could give the problem to the other person (cooperate), or not respond and let the other person take the problem (share). Other possibilities were for both subjects to try to take the problem (complete), or for neither subject to respond and thereby let the person who worked the last problem also work the next one (<b>passive</b> <b>trust).</b> When only four lever pulls were required to distribute a problem (no external contingencies to reach either equity or trust) subjects reached equity, but only minimal trust (strict alternation of single problems) developed in 18 sessions. When 30 or 60 lever pulls were required to distribute a problem (smaller response requirement for <b>passive</b> <b>trust</b> and therefore a contingency for trust), trusting behavior developed after a few sessions (fixed ratio 30) or after several trials of the first session (fixed ratio 60) and it ordinarily expanded gradually to 10 to 15 consecutive problems through <b>passive</b> <b>trust.</b> The aversiveness of the inequity involved in trusting appears to necessitate a contingency for acquisition. Once trust develops, however, this aversiveness is reduced as subjects learn the inequity is only temporary (e. g., once trust was acquired at fixed ratio 60 it was maintained at fixed ratio 4, which would not initially produce it), and the direction of the inequity appears to become of questionable importance (e. g., being behind was alternated over rather than within sessions and usually not in a systematic manner) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis studies the interorganisational trust {{process in the}} Belgian criminal justice system. It {{is the result of}} a five-year (2012 - 2017) study in the context of the IAP project Justice and Populations (IAP VII/ 22) financed by Belspo. The research takes a public administration perspective and studies the trust process between the local police, the federal police, the public prosecutor’s office and the examining magistrates; these are the central actors. The purpose of the study was twofold. The first goal was descriptive. The meaning of the trust process was examined from the perspective of the central actors. The second goal was explanatory. Here, the (sub) antecedents that might influence on the trust process were examined. The study thus tries to fill the gaps in the literature on ‘trust within justice’. On the basis of these goals, 4 research questions were formulated: RQ 1. What is the formal-legal context of the relationships between the local police, the federal police, the public prosecutor’s office and the examining magistrates, henceforth called the actors? RQ 2. How do the actors reflect on the specific aspects of the trust and distrust process? RQ 3. How do the actors interpret the three central elements of the trust process in their relationship with the respective other actors? RQ 4. What are the (sub) antecedents of the trust process (for the three elements separately as well as for the process as a whole) in the relationship between the actors? The trust process as defined as follows in this study: the willingness of the trustor to be vulnerable (<b>passive</b> <b>trust),</b> based on the positive expectations regarding the intentions and the behavior of the trustee (the perceived trustworthiness), which can lead to actual actions (active trust). The terms between brackets are the central elements of the trust process. A central proposition of this study is inspired by Dietz and Den Hartog (Dietz, 2011, p. 215) and states that the trust process starts with the perceived trustworthiness, and runs through <b>passive</b> <b>trust,</b> to active trust. This means that there is only active trust when the trustee is perceived to be trustworthy and when there is <b>passive</b> <b>trust.</b> Hence, when the trustee is perceived as trustworthy, this does not automatically imply that there will be <b>passive</b> <b>trust</b> and active trust. The trust process can be influenced by different antecedents, that were further subdivided into different subantecedents in this study. In order to answer the research questions, an exploratory qualitative study was done, consisting of 6 parts: Part 1 : development of the initial conceptual framework Part 2 : selection of central actors Part 3 : outline of the formal-legal context Part 4 : first refinement of the initial conceptual framework by means of an analysis of legal sources Part 5 : second refinement of the initial conceptual framework by means of an analysis of scientific literature, other relevant documents and 6 expert interviews Part 6 : third refinement of the initial conceptual framework by studying the embedded cases, based on 32 semi-structured interviews No comparison was made between the different parts of the study and thus between the different data collection methods. On the other hand, the different parts did not follow sequentially, so it is possible that they somehow influenced one another. In part 1, the initial conceptual framework was developed by studying the scientific literature. In part 2, the central actors of this study were determined by means of an analysis of the criminal procedural law. In part 3, we described the formal legal context. This part gave more insight in the relationships between the central actors and served as a background for the empirical research. Part 4 consisted of the analysis of legal sources. This resulted in a list of tentative propositions regarding the influence of the (sub) antecedents on ‘trust’. This list was the basis for part 5. On the one hand, further information on these propositions was sought in the scientific literature and other relevant documents. On the other hand, the propositions from part 4 were presented to 6 experts. In part 5 we examined whether the (sub) antecedents had specific properties that could explain their influence on the trust process and whether there were interactions between the different (sub) antecedents in their impact on the trust process. This resulted in a new list of propositions. Part 6 of the study concerned the study of the embedded cases. Here, 32 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the central actors of two departments of one judicial district. Specifically, interviews were conducted with the local police (the police chiefs and members of the local police), the federal police (the “dirjuds”, i. e. judicial directors, and the members of the federal police), the public prosecutors, and the examining magistrates. These interviews had two aims. First, they were used to explore respondents’ views on four specific issues regarding the trust process: the definition, negative trust and positive distrust, the connection between interpersonal trust/distrust process and the interorganisational trust/distrust process, and the model of Lewicki, McAllister and Bies (1998). Second, the interviews were used to investigate the impact of the (sub) antecedents on the trust process. This part also resulted in a new list of propositions. It is expected that research results will be published in the beginning of 2018 status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework for the systematic linking of theory and empiricism in a transnational perspective accommodating the local, the national and the international simultaneously. The argument expands the narrow State-centred approach of Patrick Chabal and Jean-Pascal Daloz in 'Africa works: disorder as political instrument' (1999), replacing a linear understanding of the global historical trajectory with a nonlinear understanding, and distinguishing between the nature of industrial and reflexive modernity (or First and Second Modernity), and between active and <b>passive</b> <b>trust.</b> The African continent entered the Second Modernity {{with the beginning of}} the slave trade; the West did so in the 1960 s. Conceptualizations of the individual, the relation of the individual to society, and the nature of power relations are remarkably similar in the Second Modernity and Pre-Modern societies. The concept 'triple chevauchement' permits analysis of the overlapping logics and realities of the "three (coexisting) modernities". Contrary to Chabal and Daloz, whose suggestion that the African postcolonial cultural order constitutes a distinct universe legitimates noncommunication between Africa and the West, the present author's global, long-term historical and reflexive interpretation highlights the similarities between Africa and the West and underlines the need for dialogue. Effective communication will enable a {{coming to terms with the}} long common history of domination and opportunistic defence, and may be the ultimate condition for Africa's inclusion in the emerging global economy of knowledge...|$|E

40|$|This article {{integrates}} strategic {{factors influencing}} trust with social contextual factors {{to create a}} broader understanding of interpersonal trust across organizational boundaries. In contrast to more <b>passive</b> models of <b>trust</b> development, it introduces the construct of threat-reducing behavior as an active interpersonal strategy for building and maintaining trust. Using a sample of 207 executive-level boundary spanners working on knowledgebased projects, it finds {{a positive relationship between}} threat-reducing behavior and interpersonal trust across organizational boundaries. The study also considers contextual effects by investigating the network density and demographic composition of a boundary spanner's social network of key counterparts from a partner organization. It proposes and demonstrates support for both negative and positive effects of network demographic diversity on trust. ...|$|R
40|$|Trustful {{behavior}} was {{defined in terms}} of the consecutive numbers of matching-to-sample problems worth money that each subject worked during sessions that ended in an equitable distribution. Two stages of acquisition are inherent in this definition; the first stage requires acquisition of an equitable method of distributing reinforcers (cooperation) to show that the within-session deviations (trust) from equity that develop during the second stage are temporary and are not part of an inequitable method of distributing reinforcers. Previous research has indicated that a contingency to trust is necessary to override the aversiveness of the inequity inherent in trusting and to produce consistent and maximal trust (half of the problems worked consecutively by each subject). The present experiment examined such a contingency. The trust contingency was an increased requirement for changing the direction of problem allocation. Only the subject who had been allocated a problem could change that allocation, by pulling a lever 45 or more times. On the other hand, no separate responses were required to allow the person who worked the last problem to also work the next one (<b>passive</b> <b>trust).</b> Hence, giving a problem {{was the only way to}} increase the distribution of problems to the other person and hence prevent oneself from receiving all of the reinforcers. All eight pairs of subjects cooperated from the outset. Trusting behavior developed for all four pairs exposed to the contingency to trust and expanded to maximal levels by the second session for three of the four pairs...|$|E

40|$|Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a {{relatively}} recent financial innovation receiving much attention from investors and media due to its low administrative costs. Literature related to ETF performance presents no sizeable records {{as a result of}} its brief history. This study contributes to the literature on ETF performance by comparing ETFs to their respective tracking indices as well as to comparable <b>passive</b> unit <b>trusts</b> (PUTs) and active unit trusts (AUTs) after administrative costs. Data used involved ETFs that are derived from securities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) that track FTSE/JSE indices. PUTs and AUTs were selected on the basis that they use the same FTSE/JSE indices, as the ETFs, as a benchmark. The results indicate that ETFs have a slightly lower tracking error than PUTs due to lower administrative costs. On average, ETFs and PUTs present statistically insignificant net return differences and it can be inferred that they have very similar return records. Furthermore, ETFs and AUTs, on average, also present statistically insignificant net return differences and it can be inferred that they have very similar return records.

40|$|Secure {{evaluation}} of polynomial using privacy ring homomorphisms Method of secure {{evaluation of}} polynomial y = F(x 1, …, xk) over some rings on untrusted computer is proposed. Two models of untrusted computer are considered: passive and active. In passive model untrusted computer correctly computes polynomial F {{and tries to}} know secret input (x 1, …, xk) and output y. In active model untrusted computer tries to know input and output and tries to change correct output y so that this change cannot be determined. Secure computation is proposed by using one-time privacy ring homomorphism �/n � → �/n�[z]/(f(z)), n = pq, generated by trusted computer. In the case of active model secret check point v = F(u 1, …, uk) is used. Trusted computer generates polynomial f(z) = (z − t) (z + t), t ∈ �/n � and input Xi(z) ∈ �/n�[z]/(f(z)) such that Xi(t) ≡ xi (mod n) for passive model, and f(z) = (z − t 1) (z − t 2) (z − t 3), ti ∈ �/n � and input Xi(z) ∈ �/n�[z]/(f(z)) such that Xi(t 1) ≡ xi (mod n), Xi(t 2) ≡ ui (mod n) for active model. Untrusted computer computes function Y(z) = F(X 1 (z), …, Xk(z)) in the ring �/n�[z]/(f(z)). For <b>passive</b> model <b>trusted</b> computer determines secret output y ≡ Y(t) (mod n).

40|$|This thesis {{used the}} events of the 2007 {{financial}} crisis as a means of being able to add to the research already done on South African unit trusts. The objective was to study the risk-adjusted performance of South African general equity unit trusts against the market during the period between 2005 and 2014. This period took into account the bull market preceding the financial crisis, the market crash of 2007 and the subsequent market recovery that followed. Data was obtained online through the I-Net BFA data base and included 161 general equity unit trusts that contained a full data set. In addition to the general equity unit trusts, the Satrix 40 was studied to compare a <b>passive</b> unit <b>trust</b> against those that are actively managed. The 10 year Government bond was also used as a risk-free rate to add to the comparisons of performance results. The Sharpe, Treynor and Jensen measures were applied to the data with the results adding more support to the opinions that markets are fairly efficient and active investment strategies are being challenged by consistently well performing passive investments. Throughout the duration of the study, taking into account the varying economic cycles, the Satrix 40 passive investment showed the best average overall return on simple return calculations as well as during the risk-adjusted measurements. In support of active investment management, unit trusts showed their best relative performance figures during the period of the financial crisis. This suggested that active financial managers were able to make the active calls necessary to weather the storm of the financial crisis. While the study did have its limitations, the results it produced are intended to offer investors further knowledge in enabling them to make more educated investment decisions in the future...|$|R

40|$|A gap {{exists in}} {{organizational}} development strategies on why some individuals remain disengaged with their work. This study addressed whether {{a combination of}} specific contextual factors could support individuals, teams, and leaders to demonstrate the attitudes and behaviors consistent with work engagement. The theoretical frameworks of social constructivism, the conceptual framework of symbolic interactionism, and a hermeneutic inquiry approach were used to address how individual psychological traits/abilities of employees support work engagement. Nineteen employees of a Canadian provincial government ministry completed an engagement survey, MSCEIT, MBTI, and SDI assessments. They also participated in focus groups. Survey results showed high engagement scores. Focus group themes, derived from the Modified Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method centered on perceptions of personal choice, <b>passive</b> resignation, and <b>trust.</b> Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s correlation results indicated a moderate, nonsignificant association between the MSCEIT, MBTI, SDI scores, and work engagement. Study results suggested 5 factors necessary for individuals to sustain engagement: the ability to balance a focus on others and impressions {{with a focus on}} ideas and concrete data, the ability to perceive and manage emotions, motivational values consistent with a concern for others, and leader and organizational support.
