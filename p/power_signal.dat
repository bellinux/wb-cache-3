The signal box is a brutalist building with corrugated concrete architecture, designed by Bicknell & Hamilton in collaboration with William Robert Headley, the regional architect for British Railways London Midland Region.

25|$|The Thames valley {{signalling}} centre {{will eventually}} replace older signalling {{control in the}} entire English Western region. The London area is due to switch over {{at the end of}} 2011, followed by the old Slough PSB (<b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> Box) area. Attention will then be given to abolishing Oxford, Swindon A, Bristol PSBs and the 1990s Swindon B IECC. This will be followed by the elimination of the 1980s PSBs at Westbury and Exeter, and the 1970s Plymouth PSB, the 1960s PSB at Gloucester as well as substantial semaphore signalling in Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, the United Kingdom {{network was}} host to over ten {{thousand}} mechanical lever signalboxes. When British Rail was created from the Big Four private railway companies under the Transport Act 1947, they began to install <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> boxes (PSB) at strategic locations such as Euston, Crewe, Doncaster, Rugby and Carlisle. The PSBs would remove the necessity for lots of individual boxes along a particular route and would pass control to one centralized location. Carlisle's PSB took over the responsibility of 44 signal boxes alone in the north west area.|$|E

Adversaries will obviously choose attacks that maximize sidechannel information, {{so it is}} very important that the strongest attacks be considered when designing defensive strategies. In this paper, power analysis techniques used to attack DES are reviewed and analyzed. The noise characteristics of the <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> are examined and an approach to model the signal to noise ratio is proposed. Test results from monitoring <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> are provided. Next, approaches to maximize the information content of the <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> are developed and tested. These results provide guidance for designing smartcard solutions that are secure against power analysis attacks...|$|R

25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead}} to noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified {{power supply rejection ratio}} that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 This paper {{discusses}} {{measurements of}} the dynamic performance of electric power Phasor Measurement Units, PMUs, and their relation {{to the requirements of}} the IEEE Synchrophasor Standard C 37. 118 - 2005. In particular, it proposes a new method for monitoring the dynamic <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> that change in amplitude and frequency during the testing of PMUs. The new method estimates the reference values for dynamic <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> so they can be compared with the PMU values to determine the PMU’s errors. This requires estimating the “true ” timestamped values of dynamic <b>power</b> <b>signals</b> with low uncertainty. The paper also discusses the issue of aliasing of sampled dynamic signals, and the relationship between the requirement in the Standard to reject an out of band or interharmonic signal and dynamic signal performance. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Due to the inhomogeneous {{portion of}} the {{linewidth}} broadening of the dopant ions, the gain spectrum has an inhomogeneous component and gain saturation occurs, to a small extent, in an inhomogeneous manner. [...] This effect is known as spectral hole burning because a high <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> at one wavelength can 'burn' {{a hole in the}} gain for wavelengths close to that signal by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened ions. [...] Spectral holes vary in width depending on the characteristics of the optical fiber in question {{and the power of the}} burning signal, but are typically less than 1nm at the short wavelength end of the C-band, and a few nm at the long wavelength end of the C-band. The depth of the holes are very small, though, making it difficult to observe in practice.|$|E
