All students who took part in this study thought that they had been stressed {{at one time or another}} due to having English as the medium of instruction without a Preparatory Year English Program (PYEP) before entering ICT courses. 62 % of the students maintained that they have had episodes of stress due to the English language during their studies at one time or another. The students use different mechanisms to cope up with stress outside the university by engaging themselves in sports, surfing the web, Meditation, hanging out with, friends, sleeping or going in to isolation.

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have shown short term health {{benefits}} of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), its long term consequences have not been studied extensively in low-income contexts. This study assessed the impact of an EBF promotion initiative for 6 months on early childhood caries (ECC) and breastfeeding duration in children aged 5 years in Mbale, Eastern Uganda. Participants were recruited from the Ugandan site of the PROMISE- EBF cluster randomised trial (ClinicalTrials. gov no: NCT 00397150). A total of 765 pregnant women from 24 clusters {{were included in the}} ratio 1 : 1 to receive <b>peer</b> <b>counselled</b> promotion of EBF as the intervention or standard of care. At the 5 year follow-up, ECC was recorded under field conditions using the World Health Organization's decayed missing filled tooth (dmft) index. Adjusted negative binomial and linear regression were used in the analysis. Mean breastfeeding duration in the intervention and control groups (n= 417) were 21. 8 (CI 20. 7 - 22. 9) and 21. 3 (CI 20. 7 - 21. 9) months, respectively. The mean dmft was 1. 5 (standard deviation [SD] 2. 9) and 1. 7 (SD 2. 9) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Corresponding prevalence estimates of ECC were 38 % and 41 %. Negative binomial regression analysis adjusted for cluster effects and loss-to-follow-up by inverse probability weights (IPW) showed an incidence-rate ratio (IRR) of 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 65 - 1. 2). Comparing the effect of the trial arm on breastfeeding duration showed a difference in months of 0. 48 (- 0. 72 to 1. 7). PROMISE EBF trial did not impact on early childhood caries or breastfeeding duration at 5 years of age. This study contributes to the body of evidence that promotion of exclusive breastfeeding does not raise oral health concerns. However, the high burden of caries calls for efforts to improve the oral health condition in this setting. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00397150...|$|R

Methods In the Ugandan site of PROMISE-EBF, a multi-centre community randomised trial to evaluate the effect of <b>peer</b> <b>counselling</b> for exclusive breastfeeding on infant health, 370 women in the intervention arm participated in a study exit interview. Individual <b>peer</b> <b>counselling</b> was offered to women in 12 of the 24 study clusters, scheduled as five visits: before childbirth and during weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 after childbirth. During the visits, the women were given information and skills to help them breastfeed exclusively. After the 10 -week visit, they were interviewed about their feelings and experiences related to the <b>peer</b> <b>counselling.</b> Results Overall, more than 95 % of the women expressed satisfaction with the various aspects of <b>peer</b> <b>counselling</b> offered. Those who had received five or more visits were more likely to give positive responses about their experience with <b>peer</b> <b>counselling</b> than those who had received fewer visits.

40|$|Nurses’ {{experience}} of grief {{is an area}} that is poorly researched within the nursing literature. This gap in knowledge is particularly prominent with regards to student nurses’ experiences. This research was carried out in order to explore student nurses experiences of grief whilst caring for dying patients on clinical placements. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was deemed the most appropriate methodology to use in order to conduct the research. Ethical approval was gained by the University of Nottingham Medical School Ethics Committee in July 2010. Data was generated through unstructured interviews with 8 student nurses who had experienced grief whilst caring for dying patients. Participants were asked, ‘tell me about your experiences of grief whilst caring for dying patients whilst on clinical placement’. Data analysis, guided by the work of Heidegger (1962), Van Manen (1990) and Greatrex- White (2007), uncovered 3 themes: grief processes, nursing and nurses education and future possibilities. These findings bridge the gap in the knowledge of student nurses’ experiences of grief. Findings are discussed in relation to the wider literature on the topic. A greater understanding of the phenomenon has enabled recommendations to be made for ways in which the experience can be improved for student nurses, an example of this is <b>peer</b> support <b>counselling</b> sessions. It has also been recommended that larger-scale research should adopt a similar methodology to further consider the grief experiences of student nurses. A reflection on the research process has been provided, acknowledging that it would be inappropriate to make generalisations about all student nurses’ grief experiences. However, I believe that this study makes a valuable contribution to the sum of knowledge in the subject area...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} some of {{the complex}} issues surrounding the notion of cultural competence—and the critical need for practitioners to develop knowledge, skills, understandings and attributes to be responsive in diverse cultural settings. The argument for culturally competent mental health practitioners and services is situated within a human rights framework which underpins the principles, standards and practice frameworks intended to facilitate/contribute to the capacity and empowerment of mental health practitioners and clients, families and communities. The National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce 2013 (the practice standards) outline core competencies (including cultural competence) regarded as essential for the mental health workforce: mental health nursing, occupational therapy, psychiatry, psychology and social work. The documented impact of these disciplines/professions on Aboriginal people requires new ways of working that are empowering, respectful and ethical. A case is made {{for the importance of}} practitioners providing more culturally inclusive and appropriate care to increase the likelihood that clients and their carers will experience a sense of cultural safety (as well as culturally appropriate services) for Aboriginal clients, their families and communities. The practice standards are complemented by professional guidelines and the National Standards for Mental Health Services 2010 (the service standards). This chapter provides a range of tools and strategies and a Critical Reflection Framework for Analysis to assist students or practitioners to adopt a critical standpoint in order to develop key competencies (knowledge, skills, attitudes and values) to be culturally respectful and effective in their practice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health. Equally important is the need for strategies for self-care and support such as mentoring, journaling, <b>peer</b> support, <b>counselling</b> and engaging in self-reflective, transformative practice.  ...|$|R
30|$|Semi-structured {{interviews}} were conducted to elicit an in-depth conversation of the participants’ perceptions {{of the impact of}} the play in order to complement the quantitative findings.

All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes across participant interviews (Braun and Clark 2006). Three members of the research team analyzed the first seven transcripts together to create a coding framework. Subsequent transcripts were co-analyzed and discussed in relation to the emerging coding framework and themes identified. Once analyzed, the quantitative findings were compared with the themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis. These interpretive processes provided a context for the trends found in the quantitative analyses: the qualitative findings helped explain in quantitative findings (Creswell and Clark 2011;Klassen et al. 2012).|$|R
