25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> had chafed against a metal clip, causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot exhaust pipe. The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} carried out to investigate the dynamic behavior of the CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> subjected to impact load. In the FE analyses, Johnson-cook model is used to simulate metal subjected to large plastic strains and high strain rates, the fluid and pipe interaction is modeled by the surface-based fluid cavity to include the coupling effect between the deformation of the pipe and the internal pressure. Besides, the Hashin damage model is used to predict the damage of CFRP. The objectives of the numerical simulations are to capture the measured forming and crash history of the CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> and gain an insight into the dynamic behavior of CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> subject to impact load. The effects of internal pressure and {{the thickness of the}} CFRP are investigated, providing a detailed understanding of parameter sensitivity...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} {{to take note of}} the increased heat in the piping system, which in turn increases system <b>pressure.</b> <b>Piping</b> that is sensitive to the water condition (i.e., copper, and soft water) will be adversely effected by the continual flow.

50|$|The {{basic form}} of a {{wallpaper}} steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe.</b> At the end of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|E
