5|$|Feynman {{developed}} a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing {{the behavior of}} subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman {{became one of the}} best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading <b>physicists</b> worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest <b>physicists</b> of all time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many <b>physicists</b> turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many <b>physicists</b> were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, <b>physicists</b> had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by <b>physicists</b> and astrophysicists.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} hypotheses about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other <b>physicists</b> and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible.

5|$|While {{the process}} had been {{demonstrated}} to work, considerable effort was still required before a prototype could be tested in the field. Lawrence assembled a team of <b>physicists</b> to tackle the problems, including David Bohm, Edward Condon, Donald Cooksey, A.

In November 1943 {{they were joined by}} a British Mission headed by Oliphant that included fellow Australian <b>physicists</b> Harrie Massey and Eric Burhop, and British <b>physicists</b> such as Joan Curran and Thomas Allibone.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} only a handful of {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as <b>physicists</b> began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.|$|E

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by <b>physicists</b> such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different <b>physicists,</b> quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>physicists</b> and mathematicians {{including}} Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski pioneered {{the use of}} four-dimensional geometry for describing the physical world. These efforts culminated {{in the formulation of}} Einstein's general theory of relativity, which relates gravity to the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime.|$|E
5|$|New {{concepts}} and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity, {{giving rise to}} a period in the 1960s–70s {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. In the mid-1970s, <b>physicists</b> began studying higher-dimensional theories combining general relativity with supersymmetry, the so-called supergravity theories.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several <b>physicists</b> showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, <b>physicists</b> found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E
