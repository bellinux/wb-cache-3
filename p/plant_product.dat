5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{vegetables}} {{that come with}} the hamburger, the first described in the literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings. Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of <b>plant</b> <b>product,</b> whether that be lettuce (as {{in the case of the}} BLT sandwich), sauerkraut (as on the reuben), coleslaw, or pickles. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more [...] "natural" [...] appearance and taste. All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s. In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.|$|E

2500|$|Caffeine is a bitter, white {{crystalline}} purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically {{related to}} the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It {{is found in the}} seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds. The most well known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, a misnomer for the seed of Coffea plants. [...] Beverages containing caffeine are ingested to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> in water, a process called infusion. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and cola, are very popular; as of 2014, 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164 mg on average.|$|E

40|$|The insecticidal {{properties}} of natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> {{have been known}} since ancient times. It is estimated that over 2, 000 plant species possess biological activity against insects, and the principal chemicals that impart such activity include alkaloids, terpenoids, acetogenins and flavonoids. Among the various <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> used as insecticides, nicotine from Nicotiana tabacum and pyrithrins from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium are the most prominent. Pesticide formulations developed from neem (Azadirachta indica), karanja (Pongamia glabra), and custard apple (Annona squamosa) have also shown promise for pest management. Despite voluminous information on the usefulness of these products as pest control chemicals, their exploitation in practical agriculture is limited due to low toxicity, latent period of action, short shelf-life, rapid degradation, and limited spectrum of activity. However, {{there is a general}} prevailing belief that natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> are easily biodegradable, and thus, are considered safer as compared to synthetic pesticides. However, there is little information on their metabolism in soil, water and plants. Although considered safe to nontarget natural enemies of crop pests, <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> might still have the same toxic and anti-molting effects on these organisms as on the target arthropods, in addition to their indirect effects through sub-optimal prey. There is very little information on the effects of these products on the activity of microbes in the soil, and on the aquatic organisms. Large-scale use of natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> may also have disorienting effects on the foraging behavior of honeybees and other pollinators.
