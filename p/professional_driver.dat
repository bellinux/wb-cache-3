25|$|The race {{itself was}} won by Dragon sim driver Bono Huis from pole {{position}} and professional racer António Félix da Costa took {{victory in the}} qualification race shortly beforehand. Huis led {{the majority of the}} event until the mandatory virtual pit stop for him to change into his second car when Olli Pahkala of the Mahindra team moved into first place. Pahkala held the position for the remaining five laps to finish first on the road but was penalised twelve seconds after it was discovered that a software bug enabled him to use FanBoost for longer than permitted. Second place went to the highest placed <b>professional</b> <b>driver</b> Felix Rosenqvist for Mahindra and Pakhala's penalty dropped him to third.|$|E
25|$|He took up {{an offer}} from Barry Filer, a {{customer}} of the family business, to test {{in a number of}} his cars at Oulton Park. For 1961, Filer provided a Marcos, in which Stewart scored four wins, and competed once in Filer's Aston DB4GT. In 1962, to help decide if he was ready to become a <b>professional</b> <b>driver,</b> he tested a Jaguar E-type at Oulton Park, matching Roy Salvadori's times in a similar car the year before. He won two races, his first in England, in the E-type, and David Murray of Ecurie Ecosse offered him a ride in the Tojeiro EE Mk2, and their Cooper T49, in which he won at Goodwood. For 1963, he earned fourteen wins, a second, and two thirds, with six retirements.|$|E

40|$|Objective: There is some {{suggestion}} in {{the literature}} that <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> might self-select to be more resistant {{to the effects of}} sleep deprivation; however, this question has not been directly examined. The current laboratory study aimed to compare performance changes during acute sleep deprivation between <b>professional</b> and nonprofessional <b>drivers.</b> Methods: Twenty volunteer male <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> and 20 nonprofessional drivers performed a simulated driving task (AusEd) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) during 24 hours of continuous wakefulness. Ratings of subjective sleepiness were also examined. Results:There was a progressive and signiﬁcant increase in lateral lane position and speed variability on the simulated driving task and an increase in PVT reaction times and lapses after participants had been awake for 17 to 24 hours (Ps <. 01). There was no difference in performance changes between the <b>professional</b> and nonprofessional <b>drivers.</b> Conclusions: <b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in this study had the same susceptibility to sleep deprivation as nonprofessional drivers. This ﬁnding does not support the concept that <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are resistant to sleep loss...|$|R

25|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Friday evening, lasted {{for half an}} hour, with sim drivers taking part, and the second identically timed session for the professional racing drivers was held fifteen minutes later. The two final sessions for sim and professional drivers took place on Saturday morning and both ran for fifteen minutes. Bono Huis set the fastest time for Dragon in the combined opening practice session {{with a time of}} one minute and 28.456 seconds, half a second faster than any one else. His closest challenger was the highest placed <b>professional</b> <b>driver</b> Felix Rosenqvist in second in front of third-placed Graham Carroll and Virgin's José María López in fourth. Piquet was fifth-fastest, ahead of António Félix da Costa in sixth. Sam Bird, Enzo Bonito, Olli Pahkala and Frijns rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. In the second practice session, Huis again topped the combined time sheets with a lap of one minute and 28.142 seconds, more than half a second quicker than second-placed Frijns and Rosenqvist finished third. Félix da Costa was fourth-quickest; Petar Brljak was fifth and Graham Carroll sixth. Pahkala placed seventh, Bonito eighth, David Greco ninth and López completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{an early}} example of the celebrity athlete in the modern era, {{appearing}} regularly {{in the press and}} later on radio and in motion pictures. He earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and indulged several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He even challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to a match auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York one mile (1.6km) dirt track. Oldfield, far more experienced, easily out-distanced Johnson, ending any thoughts the boxer might have had about becoming a <b>professional</b> <b>driver.</b> Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket (a large sum at the time), he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change, as {{he was going to make}} his return trip at the same speed. Johnson was also interested in opera (his favorite being Il Trovatore) and in history — he was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte, believing him to have risen from a similar origin to his own. In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{association}} of work nature, lifestyle and obesity with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Methods: A total of 3376 Chinese <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> aged 18 to 70 years were recruited to assess the HRQOL by SF- 12 summary scores (Physical Component Summary [PCS]; Mental Component Summary [MCS]), and collect data for work nature, lifestyle, and body mass index. Factors associated with HRQOL were examined by multiphase regression analyses. Results: <b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> reported poorer physical and mental HRQOL than the general population. Shift work and lorry driving had significant negative effect on HRQOL. Obesity was associated with lower PCS but higher MCS. Conclusions: HRQOL of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> tended to be low, especially among lorry drivers and shift drivers. Health intervention programs should promote regular exercise, healthy eating, no smoking, and weight control, which are modifiable factors improving HRQOL.

60|$|It {{was but a}} short walk, and yet it took us some time, for {{my uncle}} stalked along with great dignity, his lace-bordered {{handkerchief}} in one hand, and his cane with the clouded amber head dangling from the other. Every one that we met seemed to know him, and their hats flew from their heads as we passed. He took little notice of these greetings, save to give a nod to one, or to slightly raise his forefinger to another. It chanced, however, that as we turned into the Pavilion Grounds, we met a magnificent team of four coal-black horses, driven by a rough-looking, middle-aged fellow in an old weather-stained cape. There was nothing that I could see to distinguish him from any <b>professional</b> <b>driver,</b> save that he was chatting very freely with a dainty little woman who was perched on the box beside him.|$|E
60|$|Going from Louisville up to St. Louis, I {{crossed the}} Ohio River and passed through parts of Indiana and of Illinois, and, {{striking}} the Mississippi opposite St. Louis, crossed that river also, and then entered the State of Missouri. The Ohio was, as I have said, flooded, {{and we went}} over it at night. The boat had been moored at some unaccustomed place. There was no light. The road was deep in mud up to the axle-tree, and was crowded with wagons and carts, which {{in the darkness of}} the night seemed to have stuck there. But the man drove his four horses through it all, and into the ferry- boat, over its side. There were three or four such omnibuses, and as many wagons, as to each of which I predicted in my own mind some fatal catastrophe. But they were all driven on to the boat in the dark, the horses mixing in through each other in a chaos which would have altogether incapacitated any English coachman. And then the vessel labored across the flood, going sideways, and hardly keeping her own against the stream. But we did get over, and were all driven out again, up to the railway station in safety. On reaching the Mississippi about the middle of the next day, we found it frozen over, or rather covered from side to side with blocks of ice which had forced their way down the river, so that the steam-ferry could not reach its proper landing. I do not think that we in England would have attempted the feat of carrying over horses and carriages under stress of such circumstances. But it was done here. Huge plankings were laid down over the ice, and omnibuses and wagons were driven on. In getting out again, these vehicles, each with four horses, had to be twisted about, and driven in and across the vessel, and turned in spaces to look at which would have broken the heart of an English coachman. And then with a spring they were driven up a bank as steep as a ladder! Ah me! under what mistaken illusions have I not labored all the days of my youth, in supposing that no man could drive four horses well but an English stage coachman! I have seen performances in America--and in Italy and France also, but above all in America--which would have made the hair of any English <b>professional</b> <b>driver</b> stand on end.|$|E

30|$|<b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in {{the world}} confront the similar {{excessive}} workload conditions and considerably high crash risk. A survey in Australia showed that occupational drivers had a higher intention to speed in a work vehicle than their personal one [24], and thus {{were more likely to}} have crashes while driving for work. In Sri Lanka, taxi driver’s sociodemographic factors (i.e. level of education, marital status) are also found to be significantly associated with their aggressive driving and risk-taking behaviors [25]. 81 % of taxi drivers in Ankara, Turkey reported talking by using hand-held phone while driving [26]. On the other hand, many previous studies reported in the literature show that <b>professional</b> <b>driver’s</b> crash involvement is significantly related to the sociodemographic factors, working conditions or risky driving behaviors [10, 15, 27 – 29]; therefore, the proposed quantitative approach using all these possible contributory factors can be used to examine the potential crash risk for <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> (i.e., taxi, bus, coach, truck) in China, European countries and other areas {{in the world}} [15, 30].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present basic {{elements}} of the research directed at identifying and determining the personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> that affect safe, secure and enjoyable ride on the public roads. A quantitative method has been used here, whereas data were acquired from a questionnaire based on a sample of 59 <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Determining personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> that are in correlation with safe and pleasant ride on the roads has been enabled by applying the five factor model of personality (2 ̆ 7 Big Five 2 ̆ 7) and the Personality Inventory NEO-PI. From these results it was concluded that safe operation of the vehicle in traffic involves the successful 2 ̆ 7 conduct 2 ̆ 7 of oneself, that recognizes the importance of certain personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> for traffic safety and the need for appropriate professional selection in case of employment of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Research results suggest that extraversion is significant to separate drivers by the total number of accidents - more open and sociable drivers (extraverted) are significantly less involved in accidents than introvert ones. Research results have also confirmed that satisfaction is significant trait for separating drivers by the total number of drivers with a fault in such a way that the less pleased and more aggressive drivers have considerably more accidents. The research opens the way for new research tasks that should help in creating a specific structure of curricula that can be used in a variety of transportation companies and enterprises to improve general and public safety...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a literature study into alcohol consumption by <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> To {{get an idea}} {{of the size of the}} problem, an inventory was made of the following four indicators of professional driversÆ alcohol consumption in the Netherlands and abroad: accident data, observed behaviour, police control results, and self-reported behaviour. The data found indicates that; in general, and among Dutch drivers in particular, alcohol consumption during working hours is not a common and widespread phenomenon. During alcohol controls, only small percentages of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are above the legal limit. In the Netherlands they are considerably lower than in non-professional traffic. Although the indicators together give a reasonable impression of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in the Netherlands, they each have their limitations concerning validity and representivity. Based on the limited data found, the costs of alcohol consumption by <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are difficult to estimate. The danger of drinking and driving is many times greater for heavy vehicles than for private ones. Therefore, the same is true for the costs and possible savings concerning drunk driving, Preventative programmes can be divided into laws, and collective and individual company measures. Collective labour agreements/contracts in the transport sector take alcohol consumption into account. However, there seems to be little interest for and belief in the existence of a problem...|$|R
