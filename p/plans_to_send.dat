5|$|Texas A {{graduates}} {{were called}} to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university.

5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for martial law was to {{maneuver}} troops in readiness for a coup, {{and he had}} no concrete <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer most trusted by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E

This setback wrecked Russian <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops had}} signed up to capture Louisbourg, and {{expected}} to go home after siege ended. The British government, who had believed that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it become evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise {{the morale of the}} troops. His first speech to the troops had little effect, and some troops were close to mutiny. In a second speech Shirley promised to send home more troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.|$|E

The United States Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the RAF Bomber Command's <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> subsonic, high-altitude B-47 and V bomber formations into the USSR were now much less viable.|$|E
