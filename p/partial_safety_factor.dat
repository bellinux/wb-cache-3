40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to present a {{possible}} methodology for the calibration of partial safety factors for the design of strengthening measures of reinforced-concrete (RC) members using fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP). The methodology is general and can be used for any type of strengthening measure, e. g., in flexure, shear, ductility, or for the design of anchorage zones. The approach considers the problem of strengthening an RC member from a current unsafe situation, where all involved quantities are known from assessment, though only in probabilistic terms, to a target safe one, of which only the desired reliability is known. All relevant random variables are attributed a predefined probability distribution, based on a statistical survey separately conducted on geometrical and mechanical characteristics of old-style components. A first-order reliability method based optimization procedure is used to seek the solution of such a problem so that the target reliability is attained with the optimal FRP quantity, the appropriate collapse mechanism of the strengthened member, and the FRP design strength, with the associated <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor.</b> From Monte Carlo design simulations, the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is probabilistically characterized, thus allowing one to select an appropriate fractile value for it...|$|E

A simplified procedure to calibrate the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> was proposed taking into account the nature of each random variable and a target reliability index. From the analysis of the results, an alternative method for the design of reinforced concrete beams was also proposed, in which safety is guaranteed by the using of a probability of failure instead a set of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors.</b> The results showed the lack of uniformity in the safety of the beams design with de constant set of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors.</b> The procedures of design and calibration of the new <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> were capable of to give uniformity to the safety of the beams and to achieve the proper structural configuration with the required safety level...|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{opens with}} a {{discussion}} on all sources of uncertainty that affect the bridge structure first at the design stage, and then during its lifetime {{after it has been}} constructed and put into service. The probabilistic modeling of these uncertainties are taken up next. Following this, the main subject of the chapter, reliability of bridge structures is approached. Concepts of limit states are introduced and various limit states relevant to bridge structures are listed. Limit state exceedance probabilities, i. e., the probabilities of failure, are defined. Various computational techniques of for computing reliabilities are discussed. Once bridge reliability is computed, the question of whether it is safe enough is brought in. The notion of risk and what constitutes acceptable risk are introduced. Acceptable failure probabilities, and thus target reliabilities to be achieved in bridge design, are then discussed. The next section centers around translating the above concepts of uncertainty, limit states, probabilities of failure and acceptable risk into a practical tool in the form of design equations. The development of reliability based <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> design equations are discussed for given load combinations and load and strength statistics. Once the bridge is put into service, its load characteristics may change and the structure may be subjected to various forms of deterioration. The time dependent behaviour of bridge reliability due to aging and how maintenance can ensure that reliability does not fall below acceptable limits are highlighted. The utility of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> type rating for in-service bridges is discussed...|$|E

The system effect is investigated in illustrative models. The results indicate that the coeffi-cient of variation of the load bearing capacity of typical timber structural systems is lower than for the individual members. Finally some statistical results for bending, tension and compression strength data are presented. The results indicate that bending, tension and compression strengths ap-proximately have a coefficient of variation, COV equal to 20 %, 25 % and 15 % if 2 -parameter Weibull tail fits are used. If a LogNormal distribution is fitted then the COVâs are approximately 25 %, 30 % and 15 %.

40|$|A {{committee}} of Civieltechnisch Centrum Uitvoering Research en Regelgeving (CUR) is currently (2012) {{working on the}} update of the handbook Quay Walls (CUR 211). In the past the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> in this book were derived using a spring model, but new developments enable to use Finite Element Methods (FEM) to model sheet-pile structures and quay walls with relieving floor. The main objective is to use FEM (in this case PLAXIS) to calibrate the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors.</b> To fulfil this objective, level II probabilistic calculations (FORM) are performed using Prob 2 B (a toolbox from TNO) to define influence coefficients for the different parameters and reliability indices for the different failure mechanisms. This is done for two benchmark quay walls: an anchored sheet-pile and a quay wall with relieving floor. Both are designed according to the FEM design guidelines in CUR 166, the handbook on sheet-pile structures. Furthermore, the calculations require coefficients of variation for each stochastic parameter, correlation coefficients and definitions of Limit State Functions. These are all derived and presented in the report. With {{the output of the}} level II calculations, a level I method is used to define the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> and besides the design procedure of CUR 166 with FEM is evaluated and suggestions for adaptation for quay walls with relieving floor are presented.
