Seven different factors, including ground corn particle size, added fat level, inclusion of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), feed rate, steam conditioning temperature, conditioner retention time, and <b>pellet</b> <b>die</b> thickness (L:D ratio) were examined. Each factor was evaluated at two levels, and treatments were developed in order that all factor to factor comparisons could be made. Pellet samples were analyzed according to the standard method as described in ASAE S 269. 4, a modification of this method, and by using the NHP 100 pellet tester set to each of its four testing intervals (30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds). The standard method was found to provide the most consistent and repeatable determinations of pellet durability, and was found to correlate well with the modified method, {{as well as with the}} NHP 100 results at 30 and 60 seconds. Physical attributes of feed pellets, such as pellet hardness, bulk density, and moisture content were found to have significant, but weak correlations with pellet quality. Pellet quality was found to be significantly influenced by all factors other than ground corn particle size and feed rate. Higher fat level, lower conditioning temperature, and the thinner <b>pellet</b> <b>die</b> most significantly lowered pellet quality, with increasing effect respectively. A regression model was developed that was able to predict pellet durability within an average of 1. 1 PDI. Pelleting energy consumption was found to be significantly influenced by all seven factors, with the higher fat level, thinner <b>pellet</b> <b>die,</b> and higher conditioning temperature most improving efficiency, with increasing effect respectively.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDonghai WangLignocellulosic biomass such as {{agricultural}} residues {{tends to}} be a sustainable feedstock for production of biofuels and biobased products in the long term due to its high availability and relative low cost. However, conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels faces significant technical challenges. One of the major challenges is biomass logistics. The agricultural residues are often harvested during a limited harvest season and stored as bales with low bulk density, making them difficult to handle, transport, store, and use in their natural forms. Densification of biomass by pelleting process could significantly improve the bulk density of biomass and thus improve handling efficiency and reduce transportation and handing costs. The main focus of this research was to better understand the impacts of pelleting process as well as pelleting conditions on physical properties, chemical compositions, biomass structure, and fermentable sugar yield of sorghum stalk, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem. Results showed that pelleting process can increase biomass density up to 9 - 12 folds. Pelleting condition such as hammer mill screen size and ring-die <b>pelleting</b> mill <b>die</b> thickness had significant effects on bulk density, true density, and durability of biomass pellets. Although the pelleting process did not show significant effects on chemical composition of biomass before dilute-acid pretreatment process, glucan content of biomass pellets increased with the increase in ring-die <b>pelleting</b> mill <b>die</b> thickness and decreased with the increase in mill screen size after dilute-acid pretreatment. Opposite trend was observed for xylan content of biomass pellets as affected by pelleting conditions after dilute-acid pretreatment process. Biomass crystallinity increased after pelleting process, but not in a significant level. Softened surface region of biomass was removed after pelleting process, making the biomass more amendable to enzymatic attack. In this study, the optimum pelleting conditions were to grind the biomass feed using a 6. 5 -mm mill screen and to pellet biomass using a 44. 5 -mm ring-die <b>pelleting</b> mill <b>die</b> thickness. Under this optimum pelleting condition, the enzymatic conversion of cellulose of wheat straw pellets was the highest (94. 1 %), followed by corn stover pellet (93. 1 %), sorghum stalk pellet (92. 1 %), and big bluestem pellet (91. 1 %) ...|$|R

A literature review pertaining to the subject, three feeding trials involving 104 swine, and a laboratory investigation {{were used in the}} study. The effects of pelleting with a new modified <b>pellet</b> <b>die</b> that produces a dense pellet; supplementation with 5 percent stabilized beef tallow or with a cellulase preparation¹; adding water to the ration at the time of feeding; soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding; the use of temperature control with mash rations, and several interactions of these methods have been evaluated. Pelleting barley rations significantly (P . 10) effect on daily feed consumption or average daily gains. Meal rations were 7 percent bulkier than pellets, and it is suggested that the increased density of pellets is responsible for the improvement in feed conversion due to pelleting. Fat supplementation was additive with pelleting when the modified <b>pellet</b> <b>die</b> was used; together the two significantly (P . 05) changes in average daily gains, feed consumption, or feed conversion. However, fat supplementation tended {{to improve the}} utilization of barley rations more than pelleting or cellulase supplementation. Fat additions apparently lowered cellulase activity as determined in vitro, but fat apparently was not detrimental to cellulase activity in vivo except in pelleted rations. Cellulase 4000 did not bring about any significant (P >. 10) changes in average daily gains, feed consumption or feed efficiency although there was a slight but consistently favorable trend to do so. Carcass shrinkage was significantly (P <. 05) lower following cellulase feeding, whether the ration was soaked or dry. Backfat was significantly (P <. 05) thicker on soaked rations, but not on dry rations, when Cellulase 4000 was supplemented. The use of this enzyme apparently increases the average daily gains but not the feed efficiency of soaked rations, at least in the absence of temperature control. Soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding or simply wetting the ration at the time of feeding tended to increase the average daily gains and feed consumption, but lowered the efficiency of feed utilization. When temperature control was applied to the mash rations, average daily gains were significantly (P <. 05) improved over the controls, shrinkage losses apparently increased (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group), but the feed efficiency tended to decrease as did the backfat thickness and the iodine numbers of the backfat (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group). The laboratory study provided some evidence that Cellulase 4000 brought about reduction in cellulose, but that the pH of barley rations was not optimum for cellulase activity. Reducing sugars and crude fiber were found to increase with the ration soaking time. ¹ Cellulase 4000, supplied gratis by Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana...|$|E

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 101 - 101. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 214 The {{objective was to}} determine the stability of 4 commercial phytase products exposed to increasing thermal conditioning temperatures. The 4 commercial products used were: Quantum Blue 5 G (AB Vista, Marlborough, United Kingdom); Ronozyme Hi Phos GT (DSM Nutritional Products, Parsippany, NJ); Axtra Phy TPT (Dupont, Wilmington, DE), and Microtech 5000 Plus (Guangdong VTR Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China). The phytase products were mixed as part of a corn-soybean meal-based swine diet at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer to provide a 0. 12 % aP release. Diets were exposed to each of 4 thermal conditioning temperatures (65, 75, 85, and 95 °C) for approximately 40 s and the entire process was repeated on 4 consecutive days to create 4 replicates. Samples were taken while feed exited the conditioner and before entering the <b>pellet</b> <b>die.</b> Phytase activity was determined from complete feed samples before conditioning to establish a baseline diet phytase activity level for each product. Phytase stability was measured as the residual phytase activity (% of initial) at each conditioning temperature. There were no product × temperature interactions for conditioning temperature, throughput, or residual phytase activity. As expected, as the target temperature was increased, conditioning temperature increased (linear, P < 0. 001) and conditioner throughput decreased (linear, P < 0. 001). As target temperature increased, phytase activity decreased (linear, P < 0. 001) for each product. There was a significant phytase product main effect which was primarily caused by Microtech 5000 Plus having decreased (P < 0. 05) phytase activity when compared to all other products at all conditioning temperatures. In summary, increasing conditioning temperatures decreased phytase stability regardless of product.

Each group of diets was assigned different feed forms such as mash continuously through the study or mash, pellet diameters of 1. 59, 2. 38 and 3. 17 mm dies or crumbled diets from 0 - 7 days followed by crumbled diets to 14 days and pelleted diets to 35 days. In the second experiment, birds reared in floor litter were assigned the same treatments as the previous study except the 2 levels of poultry oil were supplied from 0 - 42 days of age. During the first seven days birds fed the 1. 59 and 2. 38 mm diameter die or crumble diets had higher body weight than did birds fed the other feed forms; however, this positive effect was dissipated as the birds grew older. The feed intake kept almost the same tendency as the body weight. The feed conversion at 7 days was improved as pellet size was reduced. It is {{thought that this was}} {{due in large part to}} better nutritive value since, birds fed crumbled and pelleted diets have almost the same feed intake but different feed conversion. Birds given the mash feed during the whole period had lower body intake and feed intake than those birds fed other feed forms.

Improvement in feed conversion by birds fed diets with 2. 38 and 3. 17 mm diameter die or crumble diets at 7 days and mash or 3. 17 mm diameter die diets at 42 days was observed as the dietary energy level increased.

40|$|The {{future of}} nuclear energy in the U. S. and its {{expansion}} worldwide depends greatly on our ability to reduce the levels of high level waste to minimal levels, while maintaining proliferation resistance. Implicit in the so-called advanced fuel cycle {{is the need for}} higher levels of fuel burn-up and consequential use of complex nuclear fuels comprised of fissle materials such as Pu, Am, Np, and Cm. Advanced nitride fuels comprised ternary and quaternary mixtures of uranium and these actinides have been considered for applications in advanced power plants, but there remain many processing challenges as well as necessary qualification testing. Nitrides are desirable candidates for advanced nuclear fuel applications due to their high actinide density and thermal conductivity as well as their low coefficient of thermal expansion. In the present study, nitrides of uranium and dysprosium were synthesized using both traditional and novel synthesis techniques prior to mixing and sintering. Phase pure uranium nitride was synthesized using three different methods; reactive milling uranium metal in nitrogen at room temperature, hydriding uranium metal prior to nitridation at 320 °C, and carbothermically reducing UO 2 prior to nitridation at 1400 °C. Phase pure dysprosium nitride was synthesized by four different methods, including; reactive milling dysprosium metal in nitrogen at room temperature, direct nitridation at 1300 °C, the simultaneous hydride and nitride formation in a nitrogen hydrogen mixed gas prior to full conversion to dysprosium nitride in pure nitrogen, and a carbothermic reduction of dysproia prior to nitridation at 1500 °C.

40|$|Whole grain feeding has {{recently}} received {{renewed interest in}} the commercial poultry industry as a mean of lowering feed manufacturing cost. Wheat is the cereal grain of choice for whole grain feeding, {{despite the fact that}} globally maize is the most commonly cereal grain. Published data on the use of whole maize in poultry diets are scant. The size of maize grain may be the major reason for the lack of interest in feeding whole maize. The first three experiments of the thesis investigated alternative feeding strategies such as pre-pelleting inclusion or minor modifications such as cracking or coarser grinding to overcome the issue of maize kernel size. Experiment four evaluated whole wheat (WW) feding and examined the interaction between pellet diameter (3. 0 vs 4. 76 mm) and method of wheat inclusion (ground wheat (GW) or WW pre-and post-pelleting). The intention of using a larger <b>pellet</b> <b>die</b> was to retain the larger wheat particle size in pellets. Experiment five investigated the effect of whole wheat feeding in broilers experimentally challenged with a mixed infection of Eimeria. Pre-pelleting inclusion of 0 to 600 g/kg whole maize replacing (w/w) ground maize in broiler starter diets showed that the weight gain of broilers was poorer despite improvements in gizzard development, nutrient utilisation and pellet quality (Chapter 4). Poor weight gain was due largely to reduced feed intake. Inclusion of 0 to 600 g/kg coarse maize, replacing (w/w) finely-ground maize, in broiler diets in mash form from day 11 to 35 post-hatch resulted in improvements in weight gain and gizzard weight without any negative effect on nutrient utilisation and carcass yield (Chapter 5). Increased caecal counts of beneficial bacteria Lactobacilli spp. and Bifidobacteria spp. and decreased counts of Clostridium spp., Campylobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. were also reported. Similarly, feeding diets containing 0 to 600 g/kg coarse maize to laying hens, from 39 to 62 weeks of age, had no adverse effects on any production parameters and egg quality (Chapter 6). These results indicated that ground maize in broiler and layer diets could be completely replaced by coarsely ground maize with no adverse effects of bird performance.. Data reported in Chapter 7 showed that the effect of pellet diameter on broiler performance varied depending on the form of wheat and method of WW inclusion. Larger pellet diameter increased the weight gain and lowered feed per gain of birds fed diets with GW and post-pellet inclusion of WW. However, in birds fed diets with pre-pelleting inclusion of WW, the larger pellet diameter lowered weight gain and increased feed per gain, due largely to reduced feed intake which may be attributed partly to poorer pellet quality. Relative gizzard weight was increased by larger pellet diameter with pre-pelleting inclusion of WW, but was unaffected by diets containing GW or post pelleting inclusion of WW. Larger pellet diameter increased the apparent metabolisable energy and ileal starch digestibility, irrespective of method of WW inclusion. These results suggested that, irrespective of whether the wheat grain was milled or added whole post-pelleting, a larger diameter pellet was beneficial. On the other hand, when WW was added pre-pelleting, a smaller diameter pellet resulted in improved weight and feed per gain in broiler performance. In the final experiment (Chapter 8), broilers fed WW either pre-or post-pelleting and experimentally challenged with a mixed Eimeria infection at 21 day of age showed that mortality in challenged birds was highest in those fed diets with WW post-pelleting, followed by pre-pelleted WW and GW (58, 35, and 17 %, respectively). The pattern of mortality paralleled the changes in gizzard size, which suggested that WW feeding exacerbated the severity of coccidiosis infection, possibly via a mechanism involving enhanced gizzard development...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{rapid growth}} of modern {{broilers}} is associated with enhanced appetite and high metabolic rate and, consequently, high O 2 demand. Ascites syn-drome (AS) develops in individuals that fail to fully sup-ply the increasing demand for O 2 in their bodies under ascites-inducing conditions (AIC) such as high altitude or low temperatures. The tendency of broilers to develop AS is heritable, but efficacious selection against AS sus-ceptibility (without affecting the normal expression of other important traits) requires identification of indirect selection criteria. In the present study, divergent AS-sus-ceptible (AS-S) and AS-resistant (AS-R) lines were devel-oped to confirm the heritability of AS and to facilitate future detection of criteria for indirect selection against AS susceptibility.

5000|$|Valenciennea is a genus of small, bottom-dwelling fish in {{the family}} Gobiidae. They are found over sandy bottoms, often at coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. The members of the genus tend to rest {{directly}} on the substrate for extended periods of time. While {{this is a common}} behavior for members of the family, this genus also float motionless directly above the substrate, which is why they are sometimes called glider gobies. Their resting behavior has resulted in the vernacular name [...] "sleeper gobies", which invites confusion with the related family Eleotridae. The members of this genus are known to be carnivorous sand-sifters; to eat, they simply engulf entire mouthfuls of sand which they expel through their gills. Specialized structures in their gills filter small crustaceans and worms as the sand is expelled. It is this specific trait that makes some members of the genus attractive to the marine aquarist, and they are often introduced into a marine aquarium for sand-sifting. Some of the species are known to be monogamous. The genus was named after notable French zoologist Achille Valenciennes. These fish are difficult to keep in a tank. Tanks with plenty of live sand and live rock are recommended. Offer foods such as sinking shrimp <b>pellets.</b> Fish may <b>die</b> even if eating properly.|$|R

These cells undergo hypertrophy and die by a mechanism that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis, but has not been characterized. The aims {{of the current study}} were to document the ultrastructural appearance of dying hypertrophic chondrocytes, and to establish a culture system in which the mechanism of their death can be examined. DesignGrowth cartilage from fetal and growing postnatal horses was examined by electron microscopy. Chondrocytes were isolated from epiphyseal cartilage from fetal horses and grown in pellet culture, then examined by light and electron microscopy, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ResultsIn tissue specimens, it was observed that dying dark chondrocytes underwent progressive extrusion of cytoplasm into the extracellular space, whereas light chondrocytes appeared to disintegrate within the cellular membrane. Pellets cultured in 0. 1 % fetal calf serum (FCS) contained dying light and dark chondrocytes similar to those seen in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β 1 or 10 % FCS increased the proportion of dark cells and induced cell death. Triiodothyronine increased the differentiation of dark and light cells and induced their death. Dark cells were associated with higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase- 13 expression than light cells, and light cells were associated with higher levels of type II collagen expression.

The paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental study of composition, heating values and combustion characteristics of granulated non-hydrolyzed residues (LHR) of separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) wheat straw bioethanol processing. The LHRs ash content at 1. 4 - 1. 7 times exceeds the values for the native wheat straw samples. It was established that higher heating values (HHV) of the granulated LHRs (on dry mass) exceed HHV of initial wheat straw and are some lower in comparison with that of softwood granules.

The higher plasticity of LHR results in lower energy consumption during the LHR granulation in comparison with softwood sawdust (most widely used for the production of biofuel granules). Combustion and emission characteristics of LHRs granules were tested using a small pilot-scale combustion system that is composed of the plant biofuel gasifier and water-cooled combustor. The test results were compared with characteristics of commercial softwood granules. Due to higher thermolability of LHR, granules on its basis are characterized with faster gasification and faster transition to the active burning stage, but the average rate of heat release and total heat output are slightly lower to that for softwood granules. LHR obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw show the higher nitrogen content than native wheat straw and softwood, resulting in higher NOx emissions during the LHR combustion in comparison with softwood granules.

40|$|Process control, {{product quality}} and process design are {{continuously}} demanding new sensors and devices that can assess the rheological behavior of fluid and solid products. The {{need for more}} methods comes because of three main reasons: (1) {{there is no single}} instrument able to perform all the types of rheological characterizations that are needed in the industries, (2) there is no instrument able to characterize all types of fluids and solids, and (3) the complex rheological behavior of many process materials depends upon time, shear, stress, temperature, pressure and process history that restricts the validity of results when for example retrieving information to the process. The aim of this work was to develop two rheological instruments made for different purposes and verify their working and measurement principle. The first instrument is a screw type process rheometer that can handle fluid and semi-solid materials. The second instrument is a die compaction rig that is able to characterize powders. Paper I focuses on an experimental calibration procedure to allow the screw type rheometer to measure the apparent viscosity of fluids using torque as a measurement of an average shear stress and the rotational speed as a measurement of a mean shear rate. From a first prototype, it was possible to predict viscosity with maximum errors or residuals smaller than 25 Pa s over a range of viscosities (35 - 450 Pa s) using a Newtonian standard fluid. The use of a dry sliding bearing created a friction in the system that resulted in flow curves having an intercept different than zero when using a Newtonian standard fluid. This encouraged the creation of another calibration method in Paper II that considers an intercept different to zero by using the area below the curve. Measurements of downstream pressure were included in Paper II {{as an alternative to the}} torque measurements. The flow curve formed between downstream pressure and rotational speed resulted in a linear curve with intercept zero when using the Newtonian standard fluid. Time variations in pressure and torque were also studied since they could affect the measurements. The variations became more notorious (e. g. increased amplitude of torque and pressure oscillations) at higher resistances to flow produced by either an increased viscosity or to a lesser extent by reductions in die diameter (a downstream restriction). The distribution of errors in Paper II was calculated through the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The calibration model based on the area below the curve presented the significantly smallest (p < 0. 005) RMSEP of 2. 2 Pa s. All other models were not significantly different; however they varied from ± 3. 7 Pa s up to ± 12 Pa s. The calibration methods presented in Paper I and II to predict an apparent viscosity were based on the ratio torque – speed or downstream pressure – speed that was not needed to convert torque or downstream pressure into a shear stress unit or speed to a shear rate unit. For this reason Paper III studied the use of a coaxial cylindrical analogue to represent the geometrically complex screw. A replicate of the screw type rheometer with some modification of the recirculation system was assembled in a Paar Physica UDS 200 rheometer to take advantage of the low friction provided by its air bearing. The aim was also to have an insight to how a screw type rheometer could perform viscoelastic measurements in oscillation. The flow curves using non-Newtonian fluids, both time independent and time dependent, were closer to the flow curves obtained with cone-plate, plate-plate and bob-cup than to the ones obtained from a standard Paar Physica impeller. The storage and loss modulus from the screw rheometer were of relatively similar magnitude to the ones obtained from plate-plate and bob-cup systems. The good results also make this replicate an attractive set-up for laboratory use. Paper IV and V were done using a third prototype (2 nd measurement principle) which is a laboratory <b>die</b> <b>pelleting</b> or compressing rig that presses powders under pre-determined load and speed to form cylindrical compacts (or pellets) of different densities. Paper IV investigates the compression rheology of ground Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) pre-handled with different storage times and drying temperatures. The physical strength of the pellets formed in the laboratory <b>die</b> <b>pelleting</b> rig was also investigated. Ground Scots presented a ductile compression and the pellets resulted to be plastic and ductile. The highest drying temperature and longest storage time, produced pellets with the highest strength values under diametrical compression test. Paper V uses the laboratory <b>die</b> <b>pelleting</b> rig to compare the yield stress measured in a stress relaxation test and the normal stress at incipient flow of Scots pine with the energy consumption of an industrial pellet press. The results show that normal stresses at incipient flow and yield stresses are linked to the energy consumed by an industrial pellet press. Long storage time of the raw material produced higher normal stresses at incipient flow and higher yield stresses in the materials. Most probably this is the cause for the higher energy consumption in the industrial pellet press. Drying temperature did not change incipient flow and normal stresses significantly...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{industrial}} {{importance of}} the chromium industry to South Africa is emphasised {{by the fact that}} it is considered the largest chromite (chromium ore) and ferrochrome (chrome-iron alloy) producing country in the world. Although South Africa holds three quarters of the world's chromite ore reserves, the chrome-to-iron (Cr-to-Fe) ratio of the local chromite ores is relatively low (1. 47 to 1. 55), compared to other deposits in the world (2. 6 to 3. 5). Additionally, iron is more readily reduced than chromium. The combination of these two factors implies that ferrochrome produced from South African chromite ore contains 47 - 53 % chromium. Current pricing practises in the world ferrochrome industry dictate that ferrochrome producers are only paid for the chromium content in the ferrochrome, which implies that South African ferrochrome producers export a large percentage of their product without any financial benefit. Research to improve the Cr-to-Fe ratio is therefore essential to support sustainability of the local ferrochrome industry. Conventional beneficiation methods such as gravity concentration, magnetic separation and floatation are unlikely to increase the Cr-to-Fe ratio, since both iron and chromium are part of the same mineral phase, i. e. the spinel, which requires structural dissociation. It has been proven on laboratory scale that high temperature carbochlorination (CO and Clz atmosphere) can be used to selectively remove iron from chromite. However, such methods are unlikely to be implemented on an industrial scale due to health, environmental and cost considerations. In light of this, an alternative approach to chromite chlorination, avoiding the use of chlorine and other toxic gasses, was investigated during this study. Since it was found that NaCI addition significantly improved the effectiveness of carbochlorination of chromite, the effect of adding only NaCI during high temperature treatment of chromite was investigated. The material utilised during this investigation consisted of local chromite, anthracite (source of carbon) and attapulgite clay (serving as a binder). These materials were mixed in a ratio and subsequently milled to 0 90 = 75 fJm to represent materials and specifications similar to those used during pelletisation of the chromite in the pre-reduction ferrochrome production process. This mixture could also be used to generate a partially reducing atmosphere (CO rich) during high temperature treatment, which was similar to the reaction conditions utilised during carbochlorination. The abovementioned milled mixture was pelletised into cylindrical <b>pellets</b> with a <b>die</b> set and a hydraulic press. This experimental investigation was based on a mono-variance procedure, in that the four different variables investigated, i. e. maximum pellet treatment temperature, exposure time, wt% NaCI addition to the pellets and the atmosphere the pellets were exposed to, were varied one at a time during experimentation. After each alteration of the afore-mentioned variables, the Cr-to-Fe ratios, together with other parameters, were measured. Analyses undertaken included Scanning Electron Microscopy, with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and cured breaking strength. Although this investigation did not focus on the cured breaking strength of the pellets, it is a very important industrial parameter and was therefore measured. Results indicated that the addition of NaCI had a definite effect. In both oxidising and partially reducing atmospheres the cured breaking strength of the cured pellets increased up to 800 °C exposure, whereafter it decreased. This was attributed to melting of NaCI at 801 °C. In the oxidising atmosphere, the cured breaking strength increased again at temperatures higher than 1 000 °C, due to the formation of a thin oxldised layer on the outside of the pellets, which could be confirmed by SEM analysis. Fine, metallic-like crystals were noticed inside and on the lids of crucibles in which pellets containing NaCI as an additive were cured at temperatures of 900 °C or higher. SEM-EDS analysis and weight-ratio calculations revealed that these crystals were pure FeO. This indicated that some iron might have been liberated from the chromite spinel matrix. However, ICP-OES analyses revealed that Cr-to-Fe ratios did not change significantly under any of the experimental conditions (NaCI addition 5 wt% to 15 wt%, curing between 500 'C and 1200 'C, and oxidative/partially reducing atmospheres). The observed FeO crystals did not make any meaningful difference to the Crto- Fe ratio of the chromite, but was of great academic interest as iron was extracted from the chromite spinel. This indicated that it is not only the formation of low melting point species, such as those proposed in previous mechanistic studies of carbochlorination of chromite, but that molten NaCI alone could also initiate the extraction of iron out of chromite. According to the knowledge of the author, this is the first report of its nature in open literature. SEM and SEM-EDS analyses also proved that the addition of NaCI to the chromite/carbon/clay mixtures enhanced the rate of chromite pre-reduction. This finding was in agreement with earlier literature reports. In conclusion, it can be stated that the addition of NaCI alone cannot alter the Cr-to-Fe ratio of chromite during high temperature treatment. NaCI addition did, however, have an effect on other important parameters i. e. initiation of iron removal, cured breaking strength and the rate of chromite pre-reduction. From the results and experience gained in this study, certain recommendations with regard to possible future studies could also be made. This included investigating i) other single component additives to possibly alter the Cr-to-Fe ratio during high temperature treatment, ii) the effect of industrially relevant additives such as CaO/CaC 03, Mg 03 and SiOz on the rate of chromite pre-reduction and iii) the effect of different clays (e. g. attapulgite, bentonite, etc.) on the rate of chromite pre-reduction.

40|$| {{potential}} to control Striga {{in the first}} season experiment. It was able to reduce {{the total number of}} Striga shoots by more than 55 % compared to the control. Consequently, sorghum biomass was increased by 54 ? 67 % and sorghum 100 -seed weight by 70 %. The effects were comparable to that caused by chemical control using 2, 4 -D. To improve the efficacy of seed coating under field conditions for the second season experiments, the effect of five types of adhesive materials (2 types of cellulose, 2 types of organic polymers and a clay) on growth and sporulation of FA and FN were tested in solid and liquid media. Cellulose 1 and 2 were found to enhance radial growth of both isolates but did not increase sporulation in liquid media. Organic polymer 2 was found to retard both radial growth and sporulation of the two isolates. Organic polymer 1 and clay significantly enhanced the production of chlamydospores, especially by FA, compared to Richard?s solution alone or amended with the other tested materials. For this reason one of them was suggested to be used for seed coating in addition to Arabic gum. Sorghum seeds were coated by a private company (SUET Saat- und Erntetechnik GmbH, Eschwege, Germany), using air-dried fungal propagules fermented on 1. 5 % (w/v) sorghum straw. Arabic gum was observed to give a better coverage of sorghum seeds and higher cfu per seed (4 x 104 [FA] and 19 x 104 cfu [FN]) compared to the second adhesive material. Coating sorghum seeds with the biocontrol agents did generally not result in a significant reduction of Striga shoots in the field, but some of the seed-coating treatments were very efficient in inducing disease symptoms on Striga shoots. Especially FN coated with Arabic gum and FA applied to the seeds in fine ?Pesta? granules increased the proportion of diseased Striga shoots significantly compared to the control by 79 %. In the pot experiment, the fungal isolates applied as a seed coating neither resulted in a significant reduction of Striga shoots. Nevertheless, FA applied to sorghum seeds using the adhesive material provided by SUET reduced the total number of Striga plants by 52 % compared to the control {{at the end of the}} season. FN in the same treatment significantly increased the proportion of diseased Striga by 77 % at the end of the season. The effect of seed coating on increasing sorghum plant height and dry matter was lower than that caused by the granular formulations and not statistically significant compared to the control. From the obtained results it can be concluded that both granular formulations applied to the planting holes and seed coating can be used as effective delivery systems for biocontrol fungi and can be adopted under field conditions to reduce Striga infestation. However, the granular formulations showed a higher efficacy in controlling Striga. Inoculum type and concentration as well as nutritional amendments to the formulations should be further optimized in future investigations. Striga hermonthica ist eine parasitische Blütenpflanze aus der Familie der Orobanchaceae. Sie ist ein Wurzelparasit und befällt Sorghum, Mais, Hirse und ver- schiedene Gräser in den semiariden Tropen. Im Sudan ist Striga im Bewässerungs- und Regenfeldbau weit verbreitet und gilt als wichtigster biotischer Begrenzungsfaktor bei der Produktion von Sorghum, dem Hauptnahrungsmittel für die Mehrheit der sudanesischen Bevölkerung. Mehr als 500. 000 Hektar des im Regenfeldbau kultivierten Ackerlands sind stark mit Striga befallen, was in der Regel Ertragsverluste von 70 bis 100 % zur Folge hat. Mittlerweile ist deutlich geworden, dass es für das Striga-Problem in Afrika keine einfache, schnelle und billige Lösung gibt. Biologische Kontrolle gilt als ein potentiell kostengünstiges und umwelt- freundliches Instrument, um Unkrautpopulationen in Ackerkulturen, Wäldern oder Weideland, wo niedrige Gewinnspannen einen hohen Herbizideinsatz unmöglich machen, zu regulieren. Die biologische Kontrolle von S. hermonthica mit Mikro- organismen (v. a. phytopathogenen Pilzen) erwies sich in bisherigen Untersuchungen als effektiv. Bis jetzt wird allerdings kein derartiges Verfahren in der Praxis genutzt, was unter anderem auf den Mangel an geeigneten Formulierungs- und Applikationssystemen zurückzuführen ist. Die Pathogenität zweier Fusarium-Isolate aus dem Sudan (Fusarium nygamai (FN) und Fusarium ?Abuharaz? (FA) -Isolat) gegenüber Striga wurde mit Hilfe infizierter Sorghumkörner oder einer Sporensuspension als Inokulum untersucht. Mit diesen Formulierungen wurde Striga sehr effektiv unter kontrollierten und Freilandbedingungen bekämpft, allerdings wurden für eine ausreichende Kontrolle sehr große Mengen an Inokulum (etwa 800 kg ha- 1 infizierte Sorghumkörner) benötigt. Dies würde für einen großflächigen Einsatz beispielsweise hinsichtlich Sterilität und Transport sehr problematisch werden, daher ist die Entwicklung einer angepassten Formulierungstechnologie unumgänglich. Granuläre Formulierungen wie ?Pesta? oder Alginat-Pellets können für die biologische Unkrautbekämpfung geeignet sein. ?Pesta?-Granulate werden durch Einkapseln der biologischen Gegenspieler in eine Glutenmatrix hergestellt. Für die Produktion von Alginat-Pellets wird das Inokulum in eine Natriumalginatlösung eingebracht, die in Calciumchlorid oder -gluconat ein- getropft wird. <b>Die</b> <b>Pellets</b> enstehen dann durch ionotrophe Gelbildung. Die Hauptziele der vorliegenden Arbeit waren: a) die Effizienz der zwei Fusarium-Isolate formuliert als ?Pesta?-Granulate oder Alginat-Pellets hinsichtlich ihrer Wirkung auf Striga unter Feldbedingungen zu untersuchen; (b) den Effekt auf den Sorghumertrag zu evaluieren; (c) die optimale Dosis des formulierten Materials zu bestimmen; (d) die Persistenz der formulierten pilzlichen Isolate im Boden zu beobachten; und (e) die Effizienz von Saatgutbehandlungen als alternative Applikationsform zu untersuchen. Hinsichtlich der Umweltverträglichkeit der potentiellen Produkte wurde das erst kürzlich isolierte F. ?Abuharaz? auf seine Eigenschaft getestet, einige der wichtigsten Mykotoxine zu produzieren. Geerntete Sorghumkörner aus den Fusarium-Behandlungen im Feldversuch wurden ebenfalls hinsichtlich ihres Mykotoxingehaltes überprüft. Eine Voraussetzung für die Formulierung von biologischen Gegenspielern ist die Entwicklung einer preiswerten Methode zur Produktion von Inokulum, die es ermöglicht, ausreichend pilzliche Biomasse mit lebensfähigen, virulenten Vermehrungseinheiten zu gewinnen. Chlamydosporen sind die Überdauerungs-formen vieler Fusarium-Arten und werden als ideale Sporenform für die Herstellung von Festformulierungen betrachtet. Daher war eines der speziellen Ziele dieser Arbeit, ein Medium zu finden, das die beiden untersuchten Fusarium-Isolate zur Chlamydosporenproduktion anregt. Verschiedene Flüssigmedien wurden getestet, von denen SNB (Special Nutrient-poor Broth) plus Hefe bei beiden Isolaten die besten Ergebnisse erzielte (105 Chlamydosporen ml- 1). Diese Anzahl war jedoch noch zu gering, um für die Weiterverarbeitung in einer Formulierung in Frage zu kommen. Die höchste Anzahl an Mikrokonidien nach 5 Tagen Inkubationszeit (108 ml- 1) wurde in Richard?s Medium gebildet, daher wurde dieses während der ge- samten Arbeit als Wachstumsmedium für die Pilze verwendet. FN und FA wurden erfolgreich sowohl in ?Pesta?-Granulate als auch in Alginat-Pellets (angereichert mit 10 % Weizenmehl oder 6 % Sorghummehl oder Hefeextrakt) formuliert. Alginat-Pellets zeigten durchweg eine höhere Anzahl von ?colony forming units? (cfu) pro g formuliertem Material verglichen mit den ?Pesta?-Granulaten. Die Alginat-Formulierungen mit 6 % Sorghummehl oder Hefeextrakt hatten signifikant höhere cfu verglichen mit den Pellets mit Zusatz von 10 % Weizenmehl. Der Zusatz von Hefeextrakt erhöhte die Anzahl der cfu pro g nochmals um 38 % (FN) und 32 % (FA) gegenüber dem Zusatz von Sorghummehl. Im ersten Feldversuch (2003 / 2004) wurde ein Screening für eine effektive Dosis der ?Pesta?-Granulate durchgeführt, zusätzlich wurde die Saatgutbehandlung als alter- native Applikationsmethode der biologischen Gegenspieler getestet. Die ?Pesta?-Formulierung erwies sich als geeignet für die Applikation der Fusarium-Isolate. In dieser Formulierung verzögerten beide Isolate den Auflauf der Striga-Pflanzen, ver- ringerten die Gesamtanzahl der Sprosse und induzierten Krankheitssymptome an allen Stadien der Parasiten, unabhängig von der eingesetzten Dosis. Die höchste Kontrolleffizienz wurde nach der Applikation von FA mit 1. 5 g pro Pflanzloch erzielt: die Gesamtanzahl der Striga-Sprosse gegenüber der unbehandelten Kontrolle wurde um 82 % und die Anzahl der gesunden Striga-Sprosse um 88 % reduziert. Dies hatte eine Erhöhung der Sorghum-Biomasse und des 100 -Korn-Gewichts von Sorghum um 86 % bzw. 110 % zur Folge. FN und die Kombination beider Fusarium-Isolate kontrollierten das parasitische Unkraut mit einer leicht geringeren Wirksamkeit. 1. 5 g ?Pesta?- Granulat pro Pflanzloch erwies sich als ausreichende Dosis für das Striga- Management, da durch Erhöhung der Dosierung keine weitere Wirksamkeits- steigerung erzielt werden konnte. In der zweiten Feldversuchsperiode (2004 / 2005) wurde zusätzlich zu den ?Pesta?-Granulaten die Effizienz der Alginatformulierungen mit 10 % Weizenmehl in einer Dosis von 1. 5 g pro Pflanzloch untersucht. Die Alginat-Pellets konnten den Striga-Befall signifikant verzögern und reduzierten die Anzahl der Sprosse anfangs um 64 - 78 % gegenüber der unbehandelten Kontrolle. Im Gegensatz zum ersten Versuch verzögerten die pilzlichen Isolate in ?Pesta?-Granulaten das Auflaufen von Striga nicht signifikant, allerdings konnten sie die Anzahl der Sprosse anfangs um 42 - 55 % gegenüber der Kontrolle reduzieren. Am Ende der Vegetationsperiode wurde der Effekt beider Formulierungen auf die Anzahl der Striga-Sprosse vernachlässigbar gering, aber sie erhöhten signifikant den Anteil erkrankter Sprosse im Vergleich zur unbehandelten Kontrolle. FA in Alginat-Pellets oder als ?Pesta? war in dieser Hinsicht besonders effektiv, das Isolat verursachte bei 74 und 80 % der Sprosse Krankheits- symptome und konnte so die Anzahl gesunder Sprosse um 55 und 60 % gegenüber der Kontrolle reduzieren. FA in ?Pesta? war auch die effektivste Behandlung hinsichtlich der Reduktion der Striga-Biomasse (58 % im Vergleich zur Kontrolle), was sich positiv in einem erhöhten Korn- (63 %) und Strohertrag (73 %) bei der Wirts- pflanze auswirkte. Die Unterschiede in der Kontrolleffizienz der ?Pesta?-Formulierung zwischen den bei- den Versuchsjahren sind möglicherweise auf drei Gründe zurückzuführen. Zum einen unterschieden sich die Klimabedingungen zwischen beiden Jahren, im zweiten Versuchsjahr herrschten deutlich höhere Temperaturen in Verbindung mit weniger Niederschlägen und einer geringeren relativen Luftfeuchtigkeit. Zum anderen traten im Feld im zweiten Versuchsjahr größere Probleme mit hoher Natriumsättigung des Bodens auf, was die Vermehrung der Pilze im Boden beeinträchtigt haben könnte. Zum dritten könnten sich die Abbauprodukte des applizierten Insektizids Sevin (Carbaryl (1 -naphthyl N-methylcarbamat)) negativ auf die Virulenz der Isolate aus- gewirkt haben. Zusätzlich wurde ein Freiland-Topfversuch durchgeführt, um die Effizienz der Alginat-Formulierungen mit verschiedenen Zusätzen (Weizenmehl, Sorghummehl und Hefe- extrakt) hinsichtlich der Striga-Kontrolle im Vergleich mit der ?Pesta?-Formulierung und den Saatgutbehandlungen zu untersuchen. In diesem Versuch war die Applikation von FA in ?Pesta?-Granulaten die effektivste Behandlung und verhinderte das Auflaufen von Striga bis zum Ende der Vegetationsperiode. Dies spiegelte sich in signifikant höheren Wirtspflanzen (um 80 %) und erhöhtem Sorghum-Spross- trockengewicht (400 %) gegenüber der negativen Kontrolle wider. Die Fusarium-Isolate in Alginat-Pellets verzögerten ebenfalls das Auflauf...|$|R
