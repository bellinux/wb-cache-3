25|$|During the 1916 Easter Rising, several {{jewish women}} from the {{community}} smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin's Jewish quarter, to the then named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the famous Artist Estella Solomons, she used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch {{at the back of}} her family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were women.|$|E
25|$|The land of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi {{belonged to}} two young orphans, Sahal and Suhayl, {{and when they}} came to know that Muhammad was keen to acquire their land for the {{purposes}} of erecting a masjid; they went to the Prophet and offered the land to him as gift, but the Prophet insisted on fixing and paying a price for the land <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were orphaned children. The ultimately agreed purchase price was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari who thus became the واقِف (waqif, or creator of an endowment or mortmain; donor) of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi on behalf of, or in favor of Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) {{took the}} {{position}} that great companies can fail <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do everything right since {{the capabilities of the}} organization also define its disabilities. Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.|$|E
50|$|But {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{to the role}} played by people such as Godfrey Mwakikagile in their quest for fundamental change in African countries. Their contribution is limited in one fundamental respect: They are not actively involved with the masses at the grassroots level <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of what <b>they</b> are. They belong to an elite class, and the concepts they expound as well as the solutions they propose are discussed mainly by fellow elites but rarely implemented.|$|R
6000|$|It {{has been}} also objected that house-rent {{in the rural}} districts is [...] much lower than in towns, and lower in some towns and in some rural [...] districts than in others; so that a tax {{proportioned}} to it would [...] have a corresponding inequality of pressure. To this, however, it [...] may be answered that, in places where house-rent is low, persons of [...] {{the same amount of}} income usually live in larger and better houses, [...] and thus expend in house-rent more nearly the same proportion of [...] their incomes than might at first sight appear. Or, if not, the [...] probability will be that many of them live in those places <b>precisely</b> [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too poor to live elsewhere, and have, therefore, [...] the strongest claim to be taxed lightly. In some cases it is [...] <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> the people are poor that house-rent remains [...] low.—MILL.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, we may {{note how}} all the deliberative {{experiments}} aim for full equality of participation, not conditioned by specific criteria or citizen competence requisites. The deliberative arenas “only” need to be highly inclusive (we might say, to a maximum), <b>precisely</b> <b>because,</b> as stated, <b>they</b> aim to have all those participate, in equal conditions, upon whom {{the consequences of the}} decisions will fall. In other words, deliberative theorists hypothesise that the “outcomes are legitimate to the extent they receive reflective assent through participation in authentic deliberation by all those subject to the decision in question” (Dryzek 2001 : 651).|$|R
25|$|George Lillo and Richard Steele {{wrote the}} trend-setting plays {{of the early}} Augustan period. Lillo's plays {{consciously}} turned from heroes and kings and toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale, rather than a national scale, and the hamartia and agon in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of Christian sin. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and repentance. Steele's The Conscious Lovers (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a duel. The plays {{set up a new}} set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing the audience or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and to ennoble it. Also, the plays were popular <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns (Legouis 782–787, 879–883).|$|E

500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.|$|E

40|$|The United States, which {{historically}} has resisted {{the trend toward}} ceding sovereign competences to supranational organizations, recently has begun to cede such competences to trade {{organizations such as the}} World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement. This process has gone largely unchallenged by the courts, yet it may pose unanticipated risks to the structure of our constitutional order. Ceding sovereign competences presents risks <b>precisely</b> <b>because,</b> once <b>they</b> are ceded, neither the legislature nor the judiciary can, as a practical matter, reverse the harm done to the constitutional structure. Through rejection of the traditional invocation of judicial doctrines that are designed to avert judicial review of ceding sovereign competences, the judiciary is the ideal branch to use its discretionary powers to prevent the redistribution of power among the three branches of the federal government. Germany, in its ongoing integration into the European Union, has faced similar challenges and provides a constructive example of how the judiciary can mitigate the constructive amendment of the constitution. The German experience illustrates how the United States may address similar challenges...|$|R
40|$|People {{sometimes}} {{resist the}} idea that racist humor fails on aesthetic grounds <b>because</b> <b>they</b> find it funny. They {{make the case that}} we can enjoy its comic aspects by controlling our attention, by focusing on a joke’s rhythm or delivery rather than on its racist content. Ironic intent may reside with the joke teller and/or the audience. I discuss how arguments for the immorality of racist jokes fall short. Ironic racist jokes may be acceptable to an audience that already rejects racism but is comfortable with such ironic racist joking <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> as individuals <b>they</b> feel confident in their own rejection of genuine racism. Distinguishing between straightforward racist humor and ironically framed racist humor reveals a price that must be paid. The controlled attention demanded, or even extorted, by ironic racist humor is possible only by forsaking empathy as the listener divorces himself from the feelings of those affected and thereby becomes a complicit if impartial spectator. Thus, if I say that a joke is not good because it is racist, it does not necessarily follow that the joke is not funny. What does result, however, is that appreciating such humor entails a lack of empathy for it insists upon numbing the heart...|$|R
500|$|One {{way that}} {{writers such as}} Wollstonecraft helped to shape the new genre of children's {{literature}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century was by attempting to remove its chapbook and fairy tale associations and replace them with a middle-class ideology. Many of these writers considered chapbooks and fairy tales to be associated with the poor and the rich, respectively. As Kelly explains, [...] "traditional chapbook literature embodies a lottery mentality of carpe diem, belief in fortune, wish for lucky gifts (such as great strength, cleverness or beauty), a view of time as cyclical or repetitive and an avid interest in predicting the future." [...] In contrast, 18th-century children's literature [...] "embodies an investment mentality. This meant saving for the future, ‘proper’ distribution of personal resources, avoiding extravagance, conceiving of time and one’s own life as cumulative and progressive, and valuing self-discipline and personal development for a better future under one’s own control." [...] Sarah Trimmer, for example, contends in her Guardian of Education, the first successful periodical dedicated to reviewing children’s books, that children should not read fairy tales <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> will lead to slothfulness and superstition.|$|E
2500|$|David Clark, {{writing in}} The Guardian, argues against this that [...] "instances of anti-capitalism {{spilling}} into 'rich Jew' bigotry are ... well documented" [...] but [...] "stand out <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> conflict so {{sharply with the}} Left’s universalism and its opposition to ethnic discrimination".|$|E

50|$|Other related {{fallacious}} arguments {{assume that}} a person without status or authority is inherently reliable.

50|$|Speculative {{criticism}} is often criticized <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> it is speculative, i.e., because relevant evidence is unavailable, {{or because the}} {{criticism is}} made before “the evidence is in.” In this case, the criticism is considered to lack any solid basis. For example, politicians (or political commentators) might dismiss “speculative newspaper stories” <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believe that these stories are just “spin” based on gossip and hearsay, and not based on any “hard evidence”.|$|R
5000|$|Weld {{appeared}} with Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen in the 1963 comedy Soldier in the Rain; her performance was well received, {{but the film}} was only a minor success. That same year she and former co-star Dwayne Hickman appeared in Jack Palance's circus drama The Greatest Show on Earth on ABC, in separate episodes. Later in her career, she turned down roles in films that succeeded at the box office, such as Bonnie and Clyde, Rosemary's Baby, True Grit, Cactus Flower and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. In a 1971 interview with the New York Times, Weld explained that she had chosen to reject these roles <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> she believed <b>they</b> would be commercial successes: [...] "Do you think I want a success? I refused 'Bonnie and Clyde' because I was nursing at the time, but also because deep down I {{knew it was going}} to be a huge success.

2500|$|Relations {{between the}} helots and their Spartan masters were {{sometimes}} strained. There {{was at least}} one helot revolt (ca. 465–460 BC), and Thucydides remarked that [...] "Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots." [...] On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica. What made Sparta's relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups {{that could be used to}} organize rebellion.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, it {{all depends}} who {{has to pay for}} the cost, and what kind of {{sanctions}} there are for polluters. If the state pays the cost out of general taxes, the costs to individual private enterprises would be much lower compared to their gains. It may be that some businesses gain from an environmentally friendly policy, while others do not, so that they are in competition with each other. Mathematicians would point out that the costs of clean air and water are only a very small component of total capital costs, but some argue that corporations are profitable <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do not pay for externalities. According to Leontief Prize winner Duncan K.
