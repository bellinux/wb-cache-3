40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the response to}} challenge infection with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in immunosuppressed C 57 BL/ 6 N mice. In the primary infection, fecal oocyst shedding and <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> were greater in immunosuppressed mice than in nonimmunosuppressed mice. Compared with primary infection, challenge infection with C. parvum didn't show any oocyst shedding and <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization.</b> Especially, oocyst shedding and <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> from the mice infected with heat-killed oocysts were not detected. After challenge infection with C. parvum oocysts, however, these mice were shedding small numbers of oocysts and <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization.</b> Except normal control and uninfected groups, the antibody titers of other groups appear similar.

Due to large scale deforestation, important feeding and roosting tress are destroyed thereby creating shortage of food all-round the year.

This unwanted diet-switch may lead to severe nutritional stress leading to low population densities, reduced litter and a breach in their nutritional threshold may also cause sudden die-off. Acute food supply may cause deficiency of total energy and protein supply in primates which may ultimately lead to a variety of severe immune dysfunctions and an impaired resilience.

40|$|Because species respond {{individually}} {{to climate}} change, understanding community assembly requires examination of multiple species from {{a diversity of}} forest niches. I present the post-glacial phylogeographic history of an understory, parasitic herb (Epifagus virginiana, beechdrop) that has an obligate and host specific relationship with a common eastern North American hardwood tree (Fagus grandifolia, American beech). The migration histories of the host and parasite are compared to elucidate potential limits on the parasite's range and to understand their responses to shared climate change. Two chloroplast DNA regions were sequenced and 9 microsatellite loci genotyped from parasite specimens collected throughout the host's range. These data were compared with available cpDNA sequences from the host (McLachlan et al. 2005) and host fossil pollen records from the last 21, 000 years (Williams et al. 2004). Analyses of genetic diversity reveal high population differentiation in the parasite's southern range, a possible result of long term isolation within multiple southern glacial refuges. Estimates of migration rates and divergence times using Bayesian coalescent methods show the parasite initiating its post-glacial range expansion by migrating northward into the northeast from southern areas, then westward into the midwest, a pattern consistent {{with the development of}} high density beech forests. This result is strongly confirmed through spatial linear regression models, which show host density plays a significant role in structuring parasite populations, while the initial migration routes of the host are irrelevant to <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> patterns. Host density is then used as a proxy for the parasite's habitat quality in an effort to identify the geographic locations of its migration corridors. Habitat cost models are parameterized through use of the parasite's genetic data, and landscape path analyses based on the habitat map show a major migration corridor south of the Great Lakes connecting the northeast and midwest. Host density was the major determinant controlling the parasite's range expansion, suggesting a lag time between host and <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> of new territory. Parasites and other highly specialized species may generally migrate slower due to their complex landscape requirements, resulting in disassociation of forest assemblages during these times. From these results, the low migration capacities of highly specialized species may be insufficient to outrun extirpation from their current ranges. Dissertatio...|$|E

Giardiasis is typically {{treated with the}} broad-range antibiotic metronidazole; however, the emergence of drug-resistant strains calls {{for the development of}} new anti-parasitic drugs. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms adopted by Giardia to cope with the oxidative/nitrosative environmental stress, encountered by the <b>parasite</b> during <b>colonization</b> of the human intestine. Giardia is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress, as it lacks some of the most common ROS-detoxifying enzymes and it is endowed with O- 2 -labile key metabolic enzymes. Surprisingly, it colonizes a fairly aerobic (up to 50 mu M O- 2) tract of the human gut (the upper part of the small intestine). Accordingly, survival of the parasite relies on antioxidant systems, though, as yet, the only two H 2 O-forming and O- 2 -consuming enzymes described in Giardia are NADH oxidase and flavodiiron protein (FDP). Nitric oxide (NO) is an antimicrobial agent produced, together with ROS, by the host immune system to fight pathogens. In vitro NO-stress has been reported to have cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, effects on Giardia. This effect leads to the suggestion that Giardia is endowed with defense mechanisms against NO and, very recently, the NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobin from it has been characterized...|$|R

Lmaj 3 'NT/NU displays nuclease enzymatic activity and Western blot analysis shows that it is exclusively expressed in promastigotes. Immunofluorescence microscopy using a specific anti-Lmaj 3 'NT/NU shows that the protein has a plasma membrane localization.

A significant reduction in cryptosporidial activity occurred in treated versus untreated rats as assessed by oocyst shedding intensities and examination of <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> in the small intestine. Cryptosporidiosis, caused by the coccidian parasite Cryp-tosporidium parvum, is manifested as a mild to severe choleralike diarrhea in animals and humans (15).

Patients undergoing immunosup-pressive therapy who contract chronic cryptosporidiosis have been cleared of the infection by temporary removal of the immunosuppressive therapy (14). These findings suggest that immunomodulation may be of value in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunodeficient patients. The lack of effective anticryptosporidial chemotherapeutic agents (8) prompted the present investigation to test the effectiveness of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone produced naturally by the adrenal cortex (5), in controlling cryptosporidiosis in immunosuppressed rats.

Using hosts and parasites obtained from a natural metapopulation, we studied the evolutionary consequences of invasion by single strains of parasites in experimental populations of the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia magna. In two experiments, each spanning approximately one season, we monitored clone frequency changes in outdoor container populations consisting of 13 and 19 D. magna clones, respectively. The populations were either infected with single strains of the microsporidian parasites Octosporea bayeri or Ordospora colligata or left unparasitized. In both experiments, infection changed the representation of clones over time significantly, indicating parasite-mediated evolution in the experimental populations. Furthermore, the two parasite species changed clone frequencies differently, suggesting that the interaction between infection and competitive ability of the hosts was specific to the parasite species. Taken together, our results suggest that parasite strains that invade local host populations can lead to evolutionary changes in the genetic composition of the host population and that this change is parasite-species specific...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{suggests}} that Brazilian Plasmodium falciparum has limited genetic diversity {{and a history}} of bottlenecks, multiple reintroductions due to human migration, and clonal expansions. We hypothesized that Brazilian P. falciparum would exhibit clonal structure. We examined isolates collected across two decades from Amap 31, Rond 34 nia, and Par 31 state (n 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60190). By examining more microsatellites markers on more chromosomes than previous studies, we hoped to define the extent of low diversity, linkage disequilibrium, bottlenecks, population structure, and parasite migration within Brazil. We used retrospective genotyping of samples from the 1980 s and 1990 s to explore the population genetics of SP resistant dhfr and dhps alleles. We tested an existing hypothesis that the triple mutant dhfr mutations 50 R/ 51 I/ 108 N and 51 I/ 108 N/ 164 L developed in southern Amazon from a single origin of common or similar parasites. We found that Brazilian P. falciparum had limited genetic diversity and isolation by distance was rejected, which suggests it underwent bottlenecks followed by migration between sites. Unlike Peru, there appeared to be gene flow across the Brazilian Amazon basin. We were unable to divide parasite populations by clonal lineages and pairwise FST were common. Most parasite diversity was found within sites in the Brazilian Amazon, according to AMOVA. Our results challenge the hypothesis that triple mutant alleles arose from a single lineage in the Southern Amazon. SP resistance, at both the double and triple mutant stages, developed twice and potentially in different regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We would have required samples from before the 1980 s to describe how SP resistance spread across the basin or describe the complex internal migration of Brazilian <b>parasites</b> after the <b>colonization</b> efforts of past decades.

40|$|Abstract Leishmaniases are vector-borne {{parasitic}} diseases with 0. 9 – 1. 4 million new human cases each year worldwide. In the vectorial {{part of the}} life-cycle, Leishmania development is confined to the digestive tract. During {{the first few days}} after blood feeding, natural barriers to Leishmania development include secreted proteolytic enzymes, the peritrophic matrix surrounding the ingested blood meal and sand fly immune reactions. As the blood digestion proceeds, parasites need to bind to the midgut epithelium to avoid being excreted with the blood remnant. This binding is strictly stage-dependent as it is a property of nectomonad and leptomonad forms only. While the attachment in specific vectors (P. papatasi, P. duboscqi and P. sergenti) involves lipophosphoglycan (LPG), this Leishmania molecule is not required for parasite attachment in other sand fly species experimentally permissive for various Leishmania. During late-stage infections, large numbers of parasites accumulate in the anterior midgut and produce filamentous proteophosphoglycan creating a gel-like plug physically obstructing the gut. The parasites attached to the stomodeal valve cause damage to the chitin lining and epithelial cells of the valve, interfering with its function and facilitating reflux of parasites from the midgut. Transformation to metacyclic stages highly infective for the vertebrate host is the other prerequisite for effective transmission. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of molecular interactions occurring in all these distinct phases of <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> of the sand fly gut, highlighting recent discoveries in the field. </p...|$|E

Disruption of contemporary ecological isolating barriers can result from anthropogenically or climatologically driven habitat perturbation, and result from management practices that influence the distribution of ungulate hosts. Thus, if zones of contact become more extensive or the temporal limits on allopatry are relaxed, we may observe increasing instances of host switching by parasites or pathogens at the interface of newly emerging ecotones. Impacts to northern systems linked to climatologically and anthropogenically driven global change and the effects of management must be tracked within the context of biodiversity survey and inventory and archival collections, as foundations for monitoring ecosystem-level perturbations. A developing interface for muskoxen, wild sheep, and parasites along the Mackenzie River ecotone represents a natural model or field laboratory to examine these processes.

Although modulation {{of the host}} immune response by cytokine 28 neutralization or vaccination is a promising approach to control infection with this parasite, our 29 understanding of cytokine's dynamic during F. gigantica infection is limited. To address this, 30 we quantified the levels of serum cytokines produced in water buffaloes following experimental 31 infection with F. gigantica. Five buffaloes were infected via oral gavage with 500 viable F. 32 gigantica metacercariae and blood samples were collected from buffaloes one week before 33 infection and for 13 consecutive weeks thereafter. The levels of 10 cytokines in serum samples 34 were simultaneously determined using ELISA. F. gigantica failed to elicit the production of 35 various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 12, and 36 IFN-γ. On the other hand, evidence of a Th 2 type response was detected, but only early in the 37 course of <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> and included modest increase in the levels of IL- 10 and IL- 13. 38 The results also revealed suppression of the immune responses as a feature of chronic F. 39 gigantica {{infection in}} buffaloes.

40|$|Background Determining the {{mechanisms}} {{involved in the}} immune-pathogenesis of the tropical liver fluke, Fasciola gigantica, {{is crucial to the}} development of any effective therapeutic intervention. Here, we examined the differential gene expression of cytokines and transcription factors in the liver of F. gigantica-infected buffaloes, over the course of infection. Methods Water buffaloes (swamp type) were infected orally with 500 F. gigantica encysted metacercariae. Liver tissue samples were collected 3, 10, 28, 42, 70 and 98 days post-infection (dpi). Levels of gene expression of nine cytokines (IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12 B, IL- 13 and IL- 17 A) and four transcription factors (T-bet, GATA- 3, Foxp 3 and ROR-γτ) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We evaluated any correlation between gene expression of these immune-regulatory factors and the severity of liver pathology. Results Histopathological examination revealed that cellular infiltration, hemorrhage and fibrosis without calcification in the liver parenchyma of infected buffaloes, increased over the course of infection. This progressive pathology was attributed to dysregulated and excessive inflammatory responses induced by infection. The early infection phase (3 – 10 dpi) was marked by a generalized immunosuppression and elevated TGF-β expression in order to facilitate <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization.</b> A mixed Th 1 /Th 2 immune response was dominant from 28 to 70 dpi, to promote parasite survival while minimizing host tissue damage. During late infection (98 dpi), the response was biased towards Th 1 /Treg in order to inhibit the host’s Th 2 protective response and promote chronic infection. Both IL- 10 and IL- 17 A and the Th 17 /Treg balance, played key roles in mediating the inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms in the liver during chronic fasciolosis. Conclusions Our data showed distinct CD 4 + T helper (Th) polarization and cytokine dysregulation in response to F. gigantica infection in water buffaloes over the course of infection. Characterizing the temporal expression profiles for host immune genes during infection should provide important information for defining how F. gigantica adapts and survives in the liver of buffaloes and how host immune responses influence F. gigantica pathogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium parvum is a coccidian {{protozoan}} that colonizes {{epithelial cells}} lining respiratory and digestive tracts {{of animals and}} humans. Cryptosporidiosis is a well-recognized zoonotic disease infecting primarily neonates and immunocompromised hosts, including human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Clinical disease is manifested as a chronic diarrheal illness that is self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts and prolonged and often life-threatening in hosts with compromised immune systems. The lack of a suitable small animal model for screening anti-cryptosporidial drugs and for examining the pathogenicity and immunobiology of chronic cryptosporidosis was the impetus for this research effort. The objectives {{of the present study}} were three-fold: to characterize chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice; evaluate the effects of Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone on B and T lymphocyte proliferation; and determine the effects of the immunomodulator dehydroepiandrosterone on oocyst shedding intensities of mice infected with Cryptosporidium parvum Adult C 57 BL/ 6 N mice were immunosuppressed with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, then infected with Cryptosporidium parvum (106 oocysts/mouse) and investigated for their ability to sustain a four-month chronic infection. Dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally (125 μ/mouse/day) or orally (8 μ/ml) in the drinking water ad libitum. Infection chronicity was characterized by evaluating mouse mortality, oocyst excretion in the feces, tissue distribution of the parasite, and the parasite-induced pathology. A progressive infection with Cryptosporidium parvum occurred in mice immunosuppressed intraperitoneally and orally as long as dexamethsone was administered. Mice receiving dexamethasone given intraperitoneally had a shorter prepatent period and a more consistent, although cyclic, oocyst shedding pattern when compared with mice given dexamethasone orally. Mice given dexamethasone orally exhibited a delayed prepatent period, with a steady increase in oocyst shedding. All mice receiving dexamethasone orally died within three months following oocyst inoculation. Clinical signs included dehydration, icterus, and reduction in spleen and body weights. Clinical signs were more abrupt in mice receiving oral dexamethasone. <b>Parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> involved the entire intestinal tract, including the pyloric ring and Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches, but was the heaviest in the terminal ileum.

Pathologic abnormalities were isolated to the terminal small intestine and included blunting and fusion of intestinal villi and crypt hyperplasia. Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone administered in vivo reduced B and T lymphocyte responses to the mitogens lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A. Dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate resulted in no significant reductions in cryptosporidial activity as determined by oocyst shedding in the feces...|$|E

When a plant-pathogen interaction results in disease establishment, <b>parasite</b> <b>colonization</b> {{is caused by a}} delayed plant defense response, not due the absence of any response. Thus, the speed and intensity of the plant response and intracellular signalling determines the outcome of a plant-pathogen interaction. The acceleration of plant responses by the application of resistance inducers could provide a commercially, biologically and environmentally feasible alternative to existing pathogen control methods. Lipopolysaccharides are amphipathic lipoglycans that are attached to the outer bacterial membrane by a lipidic entity inserted into the bacterial phospholipid monolayer, with the saccharidic part oriented towards the exterior. The general structure of this compound is comprised of an anchor named lipid A associated with a core polysaccharide, which bears an O-antigen domain. LPS has been described as one of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) capable of eliciting the activation of the plant innate immune system. LPS present in the outer membranes of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PBPR) are major determinants of induced systemic resistance (ISR). In addition, LPS may function as an activator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), providing non-specific immunization against later infection. Evidence suggests that LPS may advance plant disease resistance using the mechanism of ISR or SAR through its application to plants as a sensitizing agent, priming them to respond more effectively to subsequent pathogen attack. Phosphorylation plays a major role during the plant defense response, exemplified by its phosphorylation of transcription factors, required for the expression of defense-related genes. One of the most extensively documented phosphorylation responses is that of MAP kinase activation by phosphorylation in response to elicitation by race-specific and non-racespecific elicitors in various plant species. Proteins that undergo differential phosphorylation as a result of elicitation could be components of signal transduction pathways which connect pathogen perception with defense responses. Thus the identification of protein kinases, protein phosphatases and their substrates is essential in the elucidation of plant defense responses. The hypothesis behind this dissertation is that LPS elicitation results in alterations in the phosphorylation profile of Arabidopsis thaliana proteins. In this study, LPS was extracted from the cell walls of Burkholderia cepacia, a bacterial endophyte, and characterized by SDS-PAGE. The exposure of Arabidopsis callus culture cells to LPS resulted in distinctive changes in the phosphoprotein profile of the cells. Radioactive phosphorous labelling of proteins provided evidence that phosphorylation occurs in Arabidopsis following LPS perception, as part of a defense response related to LPS elicitation. Further investigation of differential protein phosphorylation via immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Arabidopsis proteins occurs in response to LPS. One of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was found to be a 42 kDa kinase, activated in response to LPS elicitation. The identity of the kinase as a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-active MAP kinase antibodies. In addition, an assay of MAP kinase activity demonstrated the ability of the LPS-responsive MAP kinase to phosphorylate the ERK-MAP kinase substrate Elk 1. In terms of the global phosphoproteome of Arabidopsis in response to LPS, phosphopeptides were purified from a crude protein digest by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/ MS). While LC indicated both quantitative and qualitative differences resulting from LPS elicitation, no peptides could be positively identified as phosphopeptides by MS analysis. This work can however be repeated with further precautions to prevent the loss of phosphate groups prior to analysis. The results obtained in this study indicate that LPS causes specific alterations in Arabidopsis protein phosphorylation as a post-translational modification in response to the perception of LPS during a plant-pathogen interaction, proving the original hypothesis.
