40|$|I wrote The Next Upsurge: Labor and the New Social Movements {{in hopes}} of stimulating, and {{participating}} in, {{exactly the kind of}} discussion presented here. These essays engage issues that will be central to any attempt to revive the labor movement. The contributors are generous about my own work, {{and at the same time}} raise challenges and add analyses that address the problems labor faces today. The labor movement will advance more through sharp and vigorous debate than by <b>papering</b> <b>over</b> <b>differences.</b> I’d rather that my bold analysis be proven wrong and contribute to the needed debate than to offer only vague generalities that don’t help to advance the labor movement. My comments are written in that spirit. The discussion here is important not just to academics, but even more so to the labor movement, raising concerns that the New Unity Partnership driven debate has failed to acknowledge, much less to examine. I can’t address all the points raised in this symposium. It seems most useful to focus on four major points, each raised by more than one contributor: the extent to which labor should focus on low-wage workers, the concept of fusion, my US-centric analysis, and the likelihood of an upsurge, including the relationship of troughs to upsurges. All these points (and many others) are, of course, inextricably linked...|$|R

40|$|The editors have kindly invited Professor Sunstein and me {{to comment}} on Ronald Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s article In Praise of Theory. 2 ̆ 7 The article is {{critical}} of what Dworkin calls the 2 ̆ 2 Chicago School 2 ̆ 2 of 2 ̆ 2 anti-theorists, 2 ̆ 2 2 to which he has consigned both Sunstein and me despite the palpable differences between our views. I {{do not want to}} <b>paper</b> <b>over</b> those <b>differences,</b> but I do {{want to point out that}} Dworkin has committed the identical error in his criticisms of both of us, as well as mischaracterizing our views. That error is to announce a parochial definition of 2 ̆ 2 theory, 2 ̆ 2 then define anyone who does not subscribe to it as an 2 ̆ 2 anti-theorist. 2 ̆ 2 I shall explain this error and argue that it deforms Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of my own conception of theory and that his own conception is inadequate as a guide for judges or others engaged in practical legal tasks...|$|R
50|$|For a while, the Blanquists <b>papered</b> <b>over</b> their <b>differences</b> by {{adopting}} {{a policy of}} official neutrality: the quarrel between Boulangists and bourgeois republicans was a quarrel within the bourgeoisie, in which the proletariat need not take sides. But as Boulanger's campaign gathered momentum, this position became increasingly untenable. The issue {{came to a head}} in 1888, when the Blanquists split over the candidacy of Henri Rochefort. Rochefort was a veteran republican with socialist sympathies and personal ties to many Blanquists and ex-Communards, but in the 1880s he had become a supporter of Boulanger and was running as a Boulangist candidate. Granger supported him; Vaillant supported his republican opponent Susini. The breach became irreparable; Granger and his supporters left the Central Revolutionary Committee and formed the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee, while Vaillant's followers renamed themselves the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Vaillant's party moved further into the socialist mainstream, merging with the Guesdists in 1901 and with the other major socialist factions in 1905 to form the unified socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) political party. Granger and his group moved further into the slipstream of nationalism and eventually became defunct.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composition}} of the Council was also subject to controversy. Kass was accused of [...] "stacking the deck" [...] with philosophers, scientists, and public intellectuals likely to oppose [...] "unfettered medical {{research in the area}} of stem cells, therapeutic cloning, and reproductive cloning. Given that fact, researchers had better worry a lot about what the Council is likely to recommend to the president." [...] Critics also charged that Kass eliminated those who disagreed with him, such as Elizabeth Blackburn and William May, and replacing them with opponents of cloning. Kass replied to these criticisms by saying that the Council was more intellectually diverse than prior bioethics commissions precisely because it included opponents of abortion. (Previous commissions had [...] "excluded representatives of the right to life movement.") Also, the council members Robert George, Francis Fukuyama and James Q. Wilson debated with stark disagreement their opposing points of view on the biological status of the human embryo and came to no agreed conclusions. [...] Since Bush had deliberately created the Council to debate and clarify the issues without necessarily reaching consensus, Kass said that he welcomed disagreement within the Council: [...] "This council is easily the most intellectually and ethically diverse of the bioethics commissions to date. We have worked with mutual respect while not <b>papering</b> <b>over</b> our <b>differences.</b> No one who has attended any of our meetings or read the transcripts can believe that we do anything but serious and careful work, without regard to ideology, partisan politics or religious beliefs." ...|$|R
