Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex.

2500|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Mullin leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was {{thoroughly}} livid over {{the murder of}} his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand to do and that he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at and she saw her husband's bullet riddled body. She at first did not recognize his body but made positive identification from the suit that he wore. O'Sullivan had been shot by several gunmen numerous times as he sat behind the wheel of his car and was hanging half out of the car with the driver's door open.|$|E

50|$|While Ushenko {{is known}} for her figural paintings, she is also quite {{proficient}} at landscapes. In Windy Autumn she allows {{a little bit of}} an inside look at her own home. This painting was done from the rooftop of her house, overlooking her street where the viewer can see her car <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> She instills beauty into such an ordinary sight by capturing all of the nuances of the color-changing treetops and surrounding homes. This neighborhood appears cozy yet very much alive considering the well-kept lawns and helicopters in the sky. Ushenko is still able to convey a sense of vivacity in her art even without figures in her paintings.|$|E

50|$|The game {{takes place}} {{wherever}} {{the vehicle is}} <b>parked,</b> usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> owner's <b>driveway.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle is {{hooked up to a}} tow truck, and the owner is given a chance to win it back by answering five general-knowledge trivia questions. If the owner can answer three questions correctly, the vehicle is removed from the tow truck and the owner gets it back, with all delinquent payments and any outstanding loan balance paid off by the show. If not, the tow truck drives away with the vehicle. The first series of episodes were filmed in Phoenix, Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Dallas, Texas. Some 80 vehicle owners took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show. The second series of episodes have included South Jersey and Indiana.|$|R
5000|$|Described as the {{linguistic}} {{approach to the}} treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences. Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many sufferers of expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. [...] "What" [...] and [...] "who" [...] questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. For instance, therapists have used sentences like, [...] "Who is the boy helping?" [...] and [...] "What is the boy fixing?" [...] because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training [...] "who" [...] sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained [...] "who" [...] sentences as well as untrained [...] "what" [...] sentences, and vice versa. Likewise, [...] "where" [...] and [...] "when" [...] question types are very closely linked. [...] "What" [...] and [...] "who" [...] questions alter placement of arguments, and [...] "where" [...] and [...] "when" [...] sentences move adjunct phrases. Training is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of: [...] "The man <b>parked</b> <b>the</b> car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> What did <b>the</b> man <b>park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driveway?" [...] Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.|$|R
