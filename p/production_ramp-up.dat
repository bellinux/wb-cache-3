Production versions of the engine started rolling off the line in October, first known as the W.2B/23, then the RB.23 (for [...] "Rolls-Barnoldswick") and eventually became known as the Rolls-Royce Welland. Barnoldswick was too small for full-scale production and turned back into a pure research facility under Hooker's direction, while a new factory was set up in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Rover's W.2B/26, as the Rolls-Royce Derwent, opened the new line and soon replaced the Welland, allowing the production lines at Barnoldswick to shut down in late 1944.|$|E

40|$|In November 2014, OPEC {{announced}} a new strategy geared towards improving its market share. Oil-market analysts interpreted this {{as an attempt to}} squeeze higher-cost producers, notably US shale oil, out of the market. Over the next year, crude oil prices crashed, with large repercussions for the global economy. We present a simple equilibrium model that explains the fundamental market factors that can rationalize such a “regime switch” by OPEC: (i) the growth of US shale oil production; (ii) the slowdown of global oil demand; (iii) reduced cohesiveness of the OPEC cartel; and (iv) <b>production</b> <b>ramp-ups</b> in other non-OPEC countries; while (v) reductions in US shale costs act against these factors. We show that these qualitative predictions are broadly consistent with oil market developments during 2014 - 15. The model is calibrated to oil market data; it predicts accommodation up to 2014 and a market-share strategy thereafter, and explains large oil-price swings as well as realistically high levels of OPEC output...|$|R

40|$|A {{limited amount}} of work exists on upward gas-liquid flow in annular spaces. This is a common {{scenario}} in drilling operations, especially in underbalanced drilling, and in high-production wells. To carry out this study, a 40 -meter high laboratory facility with an annulus flow loop composed of a 5 - 1 / 2 in. outer-pipe and a 2 - 3 / 8 in. inner-pipe was used, with tap water as the liquid phase and compressed-air as the gas phase. This work?s objective was to phenomenologically characterize gas-liquid flow in annular space, investigate possible causes of unexpected periodic formation of liquid slugs in the annulus, assess potential effects of eccentricity of the inner pipe, extract empirical relationships between two-phase flow parameters (e. g. pressure drop, holdup, and Reynolds, Weber and Froude numbers) for both concentric and eccentric configurations, investigate production hysteresis effects on test results, and test ramp-up sequences to try to mimic possible subsequent accumulation of liquid in the annulus. The findings from this work revealed that total pressure drops in concentric and eccentric cases are similar at high gas superficial velocities; however, trends suggest that an eccentric inner pipe causes higher pressure drops at low gas superficial velocities. This is probably due to observed local liquid accumulations around the couplings of the inner pipe when in eccentric configuration. The presence of couplings affects {{the stability of the}} Taylor bubble in seemingly slug flows. No liquid accumulation was seen in any of the hysteresis or ramp-up scenarios tested. In ramp-up tests, pressure gradient spikes {{at the beginning of each}} test were found to be strongly dependent on the ramp slope. This work contributes to the understanding of gas-liquid flow phenomena observed in the field, both in wells and in risers, when localized liquid flow reversal and/or accumulation may lead to gas production impairments. This work also sheds some light on how to best operate wells and facilities, and particularly on how to manage <b>production</b> <b>ramp-ups...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{successfully}} ramp-up the production when new products {{are to be}} introduced has become a critical issue for many manufacturing companies. Increased globalisation which implies severe competition makes it important both for original equipment manufacturers but also for their suppliers to perform better than potential competitors during ramp-up. Moreover, constantly decreasing product life cycles and constantly increase of individualised customer demands implies that <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> has to be performed more frequent. Hence, this frequency makes it necessary to realise production ramp-ups both in a time efficient and cost efficient manner {{in order to be}} competitive. So far a lot of researches have focused the scope of time-to-market which ends when the first product is commercialised and very few researches have focused the time-to-volume which includes the process of ramping up to full production. Consequently the knowledge and supportive tools, such as a <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> framework, that are available in order to manage <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> in a successful manner is today rather sparse. Hence, to provide a starting point for a framework that can be used when managing <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> the objective of this thesis is to identify and categorise factors that affect the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance. The identification of factors affecting <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance has partly been done by reviewing previous research findings. Moreover, since previous studies of factors affecting <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance are few, two case studies have been undertaken with the intention to complement and add knowledge to what could be found in previous research. These case studies focus the preparations for and the realisation of production ramp-ups in two assembly systems within a Swedish manufacturing company. The contribution from this thesis is a categorisation and a scrutiny of the factors identified to affect the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance found both in previously research and in empirical studies. The main conclusion is that several of the factors affecting the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance are dependent on each other both through chain relations and mutual relations. Moreover it has been concluded that the effect of different factors during the design and production preparation process and the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> process are dependent on the factors that constitute the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> situation. Therefore it has also been concluded that a useful categorisation needs to separate the factors that constitute the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> situation from factors during the design and production preparation process and the product ramp-up process. One {{reason for this is that}} such a categorisation facilitates the possibilities to compare different production ramp-ups to each other and learn from this. Moreover this type of categorisation can be supportive when different factors need to be prioritised during a <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> in a certain situation...|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} of the negative influence of suppliers’ RPE on clients’ RPE and the positive influence {{of the number of}} suppliers on clients’ RPE merit attention. Suppliers may have high RPE if they do not engage in labor-intensive production of the parts they are selling. According to the former vice-executive director of Toyota, this description fits the typical keiretsu first-tier suppliers (Shirouzu 2015). Toyota and the other major Japanese assemblers that followed the Toyota method have traditionally engaged in business only with a small number of permanent first-tier suppliers and have expanded production only through first-tier suppliers by allowing them to procure higher volumes of materials from other manufacturers and to resell them to Toyota (Wada 1992). Although such keiretsu arrangements have long been considered the source of the high competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers (Aoki 1990; Dyer 1996), the results of this paper overall suggest the following: (1) Japanese automakers may be moving away from this strategy by bypassing intermediaries, reaching across network cliques, and expanding the number of their direct suppliers; (2) this strategy enables them better to <b>ramp-up</b> <b>production</b> compared to the originally preferred exclusive procurement through a few designated intermediates. Specifically, the present method enables us to observe that diversification of supply networks led to increased revenues per employee, as opposed to increased demand followed by an expansion of the supply base.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} information enabling and supporting <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> processes, by exploring critical {{events and the}} role of information in such events. Design/methodology/approach – The research approach was based on empirical and theoretical investigations. A selection of 30 events, considered the most critical for <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> realization and/or performance at one Swedish automotive company, were categorized and constituted the base for the analysis which focused information types and sources enabling event handling. Findings – Information enabling event handling is a balanced combination of problem and domain information, regardless of event category. However, a differentiation concerning preference and usage of information types between experienced and less experienced personnel is identified. Problem-solving information has the character of pragmatic information, composed of complementary parts of confirmation and novelty in terms of domain and problem information. The preferred information source in all event categories was “other people”. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on the application of information in relation to critical events during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> General information theory is not addressed in depth. Practical implications – Information type and information source are not dependent on certain event categories, which allows a general information strategy enabling <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> To facilitate <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> and event handling managers and key personnel need to apply a holistic perspective and need to be updated on domain information of the products, the equipment, and the production process during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> Originality/value – The originality is in the focus and role of information to achieve an efficient <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> performance.

40|$|To meet {{customer}} {{demands and}} global competition, {{the frequency of}} new product introductions in the manufacturing industry has increased. As the frequency and thereby number of production ramp-ups increases, ramp-up {{will no longer be}} an occasional event but will become a part of daily production challenges. To achieve an efficient <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up,</b> the ability to handle both planned and unplanned changes in production systems, in this thesis called ‘critical events’, is vital. So far, the role of information related to <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> has not been investigated in depth, despite its necessity for the understanding and handling of critical events. This research explores the role of information used by human actors when handling critical events in production systems during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> situations. A systems approach was adopted and an empirical approach was used for three longitudinal case studies at two manufacturing companies in Sweden. Each case study involved <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> of a new product and a new or modified production system at an assembly plant. Critical events in <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> situations have varying characteristics and are categorised in the following ways in this thesis: (1) the domain the event concerns, e. g. supply, product, equipment, and personnel; (2) whether the event is planned or unplanned, and if how to handle the event is known or unknown; and finally (3) the type of event, i. e. if routine, trained-for, or novel for personnel who handle the event. The majority of the critical events identified in this research was unplanned and considered as negative for the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> realisation and performance. Their unpredictable characteristics require them to be handled and learned from in real time. Handling as a form of control was found to be a key issue, since events that could be influenced or handled were not considered as critical as those that were beyond one’s control. Hence, the perceived criticality depends on the ability to handle critical events. To have the ability to handle an event, despite its character, understanding of the event is vital. Understanding presupposes relevant information for handling, i. e. information that makes a difference; domain and problem information which partly confirms and partly renews or updates the description in a ramp-up situation. This research contributes knowledge about types of information needed when handling various types of critical events in relation to <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> Moreover, information sources and ways of dissemination for improved <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> have been identified. An understanding of the information that enables handling of critical events in production systems can facilitate good ramp-up performance...|$|E
40|$|In the fast-paced {{world of}} {{consumer}} electronics, short development lead times and efficient product ramp-ups are invaluable. The sooner and faster a firm can <b>ramp-up</b> <b>production</b> {{of a new}} product, the faster it can start to earn revenues, profit from early market opportunities, establish technology standards and release scarce development resources to support new product development projects. Yet, many companies fail to meet their time-to-market and time-to-volume targets and the complex interrelationships between product characteristics, development lead time and ramp-up performance are largely unexplored. In response to these limitations our study focuses on three research questions: (1) To what extent is ramp-up performance determined by development lead time and product complexity? (2) How do these relationships change {{in the course of}} the ramp-up lifecycle? and (3) How can the results be explained? Our results contribute to the field of operations management in three ways. First, we offer a more comprehensive and enriched analysis of the drivers for development lead time and ramp-up performance in the cell phone industry. Second, we demonstrate that late schedule slips – although disastrous for customer relations in which due dates are crucial – provide the opportunity to build up (semi-finished) product buffers which in turn increase the initial ramp-up performance. Third, we show that it is important to take these effects into account in a jointly and lifecycle-dependent manner. Thus, our insights support management efforts to anticipate the consequences of product design decisions, predict development schedule risk levels, and make informed decisions about production volume commitments...|$|R
40|$|Draw {{management}} {{is a critical}} part of the successful recovery of mineral reserves by cave mining. This thesis presents a draw control model that indirectly increases resource value by controlling production based on geotechnical constraints. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated as a goal programming model that includes seven general constraint types. These constraints model the mining system and drive the operation towards the dual strategic targets of total monthly production tonnage and cave shape. This approach increases value by ensuring that reserves are not lost due to poor draw practice. The model also allows any number of processing plants to feed from multiple sources (caves, stockpiles, and dumps). The ability to blend material allows the model to be included in strategic level studies that target corporate objectives while emphasising production control within each cave. There are three main production control constraints in the MILP. The first of these, the draw maturity rules, is designed to balance drawpoint production with cave propagation rates. The maturity rules are modelled using disjunctive constraints. The constraint regulates production based on drawpoint depletion. Drawpoint production increases from 100 mm/d to 404 mm/d once the drawpoint reaches 6. 5 % depletion. Draw can continue at this maximum rate until drawpoint ramp-down begins as 93. 5 % depletion. The maximum draw rate decreases to 100 mm/d at drawpoint closure in the three maturity rule systems included in the thesis. The maturity rule constraints combine with the minimum draw rate constraint to limit production based on the difference between the actual and ideal drawpoint depletion. Drawpoints which lag behind their ideal depletion are restricted by the maturity rules while those that exceeded the ideal depletion were forced to mine at their minimum rate to ensure that cave porosity was maintained. The third production control constraint, relative draw rate (RDR), prohibits isolated draw by ensuring that extraction is uniform across the cave. It does this by controlling the relative draw difference between adjacent drawpoints. It is apparent in this thesis that production from a drawpoint can have an indirect effect on remote drawpoints because the relative draw rate constraints pass from one neighbour to the next within the cave. Tightening the RDR constraint increases production variation during cave ramp-up. This variation occurs because the maturity rules dictate that new drawpoints must produce at a lower draw rate than mature drawpoints. As a result, newly opened drawpoints limit production from the mature drawpoints within their region of the cave (not just their immediate neighbours). The MILP is also used to quantify production changes caused by varying geotechnical constraints, limiting haulage capacity, and reversing mining direction. It has been shown that tightening the RDR constraint decreases total cave <b>production.</b> The <b>ramp-up</b> duration also increased by eighteen months compared to the control RDR scenario. Tighter relative draw also made it difficult to maintain cave shape during ramp-up. However, once ramp-up was complete, the tighter control produced a better depletion surface. The trial with limited haulage capacity identified bottlenecks in the materials handling system. The main bottlenecks occur in the production drives with the greatest tonnage associated with their drawpoints. There also appears to be an average haulage capacity threshold for the extraction drives of 2000 tonnes per drawpoint. Only one drive with a capacity below this threshold achieves its target production in each period. Reversing the cave advance to initiate in the South-East shows the greatest potential for achieving total production and cave shape targets. The greater number of drawpoints available early in the schedule provides more production capacity. This ability to distribute production over a greater number of drawpoints reduces the total <b>production</b> lag during <b>ramp-up.</b> In addition to its role in feasibility studies, the MILP is well suited for use as a production guidance tool. It has been shown in three case studies that the model can be used to evaluate production performance and to establish long term production targets. The first of the studies shows the analysis of historical production data by comparison to the MILP optimised schedule. The second shows that the model produces an optimised production plan irrespective of the current cave state. The final case study emulates the draw control cycle used by the Premier Diamond Mine. The series of optimised production schedules mirror that of the life-of-mine schedule generated {{at the start of the}} iterative process. The results illustrate how the MILP can be used by a draw control engineer to analyse production data and to develop long term production targets both before and after a cave is brought into full production...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnplanned {{engineering}} changes {{represent a}} major field of disturbance during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> They require time-consuming qualification and approval procedures for product- or process-related redesign. Numerous engineering changes during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> {{can be traced}} back to lack of product maturity, not sufficiently increased during the precedent stage of product development. By applying effective and efficient product testing processes, product maturity can be measured and enhanced at an early stage. As a consequence, unplanned engineering changes can be avoided. Nevertheless, contemporary test management procedures lack of methodological support, especially in the field of test planning. To date, the successful evaluation of testing demand and selection of necessary test specifications mainly depends on the expert knowledge of the test management team. The present paper focuses on the development of optimized test planning procedures in order to accelerate early product maturity enhancement for stabilizing <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> processes. Following design science research methodology, the relevance of the problem statement in the application environment of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> will be assessed.

40|$|As a {{component}} of the innovation process and as a follow-up to product development, <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> serves to integrate innovation into industrial production. Although the possibilities of measuring performance in monetary terms are limited during the ramp-up period, intangible potential is created, the effects of which only become visible in later phases and projects. Several scientific studies have indicated that <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> is an important predictor of a firm’s success. Moreover, there are several indications from management practice that, on the one hand, show its relevance and on the other hand, attest to the challenges arising from attempts to cope with <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> To deal with these issues, suitable models need to be developed which enhance the transparency of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> and allow for an efficient process of purposeful decision making. One possibility to satisfy these needs is to apply the performance management approach. Performance management aims to accomplish that decisions are made under consideration of both pursued objectives and associated (side) effects. Thus, the goal of this work is the conceptual design of a guideline for developing a ramp-up-specific system of performance management. This process is implemented in the five modular parts A to E. Part A represents {{the state of the art}} of performance management during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> Firstly, based on a meta-analysis, a ramp-up-specific catalogue of requirements is developed. By means of this catalogue, five selected articles are analyzed, which show up weaknesses, particularly with regard to the linkaging of ramp-up objectives with a firm’s objectives, the systematic support of continuing enhancement, the consideration of the strategic relevance, the integration of available expert knowledge, and the adequate guidance and support of decision makers during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> In Part B, distinctive attributes of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> are educed: the initially lacking control over production quality, ongoing experience effects, and the varying intensity of production as an image of ramp-up policy. Subsequently, a research map of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> is drawn – as from a theoretical perspective. To fill the identified research gap, a lean, recursive-dynamic base model is developed. This model is capable of explaining the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> curve progression through the identified attributes alone. The result facilitates a deeper understanding of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up,</b> creating the basis of a theory of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up,</b> and providing a tool of communication for explanatory contributions. Moreover, these theoretical deliberations show up the gap between the special production theories already in existence, and indicate a potential closing of this gap. Part C looks in detail at performance planning as the initial phase of the performance management process. Based on a collection of ramp-up-specific objectives, a hierarchy of objectives is developed, spearheaded by seven fundamental ramp-up objectives. The results meet the demands in the literature for project-independent systems of objectives and business ratios. Expert interviews reveal that the results match firms’ perceptions. Thus, the created systemization of ramp-up goals is not only of theoretical but also of practical value: It offers decision makers an overview of suitable objectives, enabling them to adjust their current objectives and also to gain a qualitative evaluation of the status and effectiveness of objectives. Part D is dedicated to performance regulation. To this end, the CoRuS (Coordination for Ramp-up Success) survey was conducted, which analyzed with the help of structure equation modeling 184 questionnaires from producing firms. The results show a context-robust, significant impact of the activities knowledge management and controlling on ramp-up performance. However, additional variations of the model prove different sets of activities to be effective, depending on contextual factors. Thus, informational groundwork is established for context-specific selection of activities during ramp-up, and decision makers can check and potentially correct their priorities. Part E comes full circle to the state of the art in part A, with a conceptual framework that transforms the foregoing results into a comprehensive but scalable guideline. No default course of action is given, but rather a simplified decision environment to enable an enhanced level of decision rationality. The concept evaluation is based on the design science research approach, e. g. taking the form of a case study, to demonstrate practicability and usefulness. The main contributions of this work are the development of a tool for comparative classification of ramp-up projects, a compatible objective-planning process, a structured presentation of suitable business ratios related to the hierarchy of objectives, and the provision of concrete advice for context-specific and purposeful activities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of demand {{uncertainty}} on the decision variable of operation time and its interaction with yield and learning during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> A dynamic profit model for <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> coupled with learning and demand uncertainty is built to identify optimal ramp-ups under various manufacturing contexts. Numerical simulations are explored to determine the various factors leading to changes in optimal production ramp-ups due to demand uncertainty. Results demonstrate that, under increasing demand uncertainty, firms should generally be conservative and slow down the ramp-up. It is also demonstrated that demand uncertainty leads to slower ramp-up regardless of varying learning rates and capacity/demand constraints. The only exception is products with high profit margin in which optimal ramp-ups are insensitive to demand uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Many companies, {{especially}} in high tech industries, are facing shrinking product lifecycles and increasingly complex production and product technologies. Selling of many goods including semiconductors, disk-drives and telecommunications products has shrunk {{to a time}} span of less than a year. These market dynamics pressure production facilities to begin full scale operations at a point when the underlying process technology is still poorly understood. Consequently companies suffer from substantial yield losses which can dramatically affect {{the economics of the}} product, the production facility, and business. The <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> will be defined as the time span equal to the difference between ‘time- to-market ’ and ’ time- to- volume’. A major goal of innovators is to reduce the ‘time –to-market’, however they cannot evaluate the effects on the ‘time- to- volume’. This paper will give insight into these interdependencies and compare two policies for the management of changes during <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{frequency}} of market launches {{of new products}} increases constantly due to ever shorter product life cycles. This leads to an inevitable rising number of <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> processes. During the ramp-up insufficient process capabilities of the deployed production technologies {{is one of the}} main reasons for disturbances. This publication reviews existing approaches with regard to their ability to support the technology selection during ramp-up with a particular focus on process capability. Further, a new selection criterion is introduced as “technology capability” which is defined as the estimated capability of a production technology in case of a <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up.</b> Afterwards, a decision framework is created to select case specifically the most suitable approach for technology selection. Finally, a new approach is presented to comprehensively integrate technology know-how into the evaluation and selection process by using scientific models. The approach is presented by the example of a hard turning process...|$|E
40|$|Many {{high-tech}} industries are shifting their focus from minimizing time-to-market to minimizing time-to-volume. This puts {{the tail end}} of product development, the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up,</b> in a critical position. This paper presents a case study of product transfer and <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> in the hard disk drive industry. We provide {{a detailed description of the}} ramp-up period. By documenting detailed time-series data of several operational measures, we also shed light on the various forces that allow an organization to increase its production volume. Finally, the setting of our research allows us to study product transfer from development in the US to an off-shore production facility. International Transfer and Ramp-up 3 Introduction 1 To achieve a fast pay-back of investments in new product designs and production facilities, companies must reduce their development time (time-to-market) as well as the time it takes them to achieve acceptable manufacturing volume, cost, and quality (time-to-volume). Whereas a number of studies have investigated time-to-market, the topic o...|$|E

Based upon this analysis, the authors built the Cobb-Douglas function for these sectors. The analysis of the obtained functions showed, that the key factor of the <b>production</b> <b>ramp-up</b> in manufacturing is the increase of labour quantity. For extractive enterprises, the capital has a higher value, which is caused by traditional capital intensity in this sector.
