2500|$|Historical records {{relating}} to frustration, revolts and high mortality rates among farmers in India, particularly cash crop farmers, {{date back to}} the 19th century. However, suicides due to the same were rare. The high land taxes of 1870s, <b>payable</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> regardless of the effects of frequent famines on farm output or productivity, combined with colonial protection of usury, money lenders and landowner rights, contributed to widespread penury and frustration among cotton and other farmers, ultimately leading to the Deccan Riots of 1875-1877. The British government enacted the Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act in 1879, to limit the interest rate charged by money lenders to Deccan cotton farmers, but applied it selectively to areas that served British cotton trading interests. Rural mortality rates, in predominantly agrarian British India, were very high between 1850 and the 1940s. However, starvation related deaths far exceeded those by suicide, the latter being officially classified under [...] "injuries". The death rate classified under [...] "injuries", in 1897, was 79 per 100,000 people in Central Provinces of India and 37 per 100,000 people in Bombay Presidency.|$|E
