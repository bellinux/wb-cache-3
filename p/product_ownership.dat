50|$|The {{principle}} of renting or leasing pricing strategy {{is that the}} right to use the product is transferred for a specified period (hours or days for renting and years for leasing) from the seller to the buyer, but no transfer of title occurs. There is no legal process by which ownership of a piece of property changes from the seller to the buyer. At the end of the specified period the vendor takes the product back for reuse or recycling. The advantages of this approach are that the customer doesn’t have to bear the capital purchase costs and that the product's efficiency is increased. A trade-off exists between capital costs, self-esteem attached to <b>product</b> <b>ownership,</b> rental and transaction costs.|$|E

Services do not normally involve transfer of ownership of the service itself, but may involve transfer of ownership of goods developed or marketed by a service provider {{in the course of}} the service.

This service can only be experienced through the consumption of electrical energy, which is available in a variety of voltages and, in this case, is the economic goods produced by the electric utility company [...] While the service (namely, distribution of electrical energy) is a process that remains in its entirety in the ownership of the electric service provider, the goods (namely, electric energy) is the object of ownership transfer.

However, when the problem is addressed {{in a context of}} “product – part – machine ” dimension, it provides a different perspective to the problem. The current study is an effort in this direction. A formulation of the CMS problem to a product oriented plant as well as a solution procedure has been proposed. A measure for <b>product</b> <b>ownership</b> has been proposed. Practitioners often face the difficult choice of what machines to dedicate to the cells and what to keep centralised. The study has provided a quantitative basis for resolving this conflict. The results show that while a high <b>product</b> <b>ownership</b> can guarantee a high component ownership, the reverse does not.

The main objective {{of this paper is to}} understand the forces driving this agro-industrial diversification which has important impact on the employment, incomes and welfare of rural residents. A particular attention has been paid to two categories of factors, agricultural income risks and institutional factors such as the ownership evolution of rural enterprises. Using a panel data of 28 Chinese provinces from 1986 to 2001, we show that the diversification decision is jointly affected by relative return between agriculture and rural industry, climatic risks, price volatility of agriculture <b>products,</b> <b>ownership</b> evolution of rural enterprises marked by the dramatic rise of private enterprises, and government’s food security concern. A number of provincial structural variables, such as population density and education achievement of rural labour force, are also found to have significant effects on the agro- industry diversification in rural China...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{empirical}} data to compare large-scale agile method tailoring in {{two types of}} global software development programme: offshore outsourced services and offshore captive development centres. This research forms {{part of a larger}} study and uses data collected from face-to-face semi-structured open-ended interviews with over 50 practitioners in 9 international companies selected using a snowball sampling technique. Analysis has been conducted using 'Glaserian' grounded theory concepts, including open coding, memoing, constant comparison and theoretical saturation. The contribution of the paper is to present a novel classification model contrasting solution focused development, where offshore organisations deliver a complete solution, and execution focused development, where offshore organisations implement work packages defined by the client. The research has discovered evidence of solution and execution focused models used by outsourced service providers. In addition, evidence is presented of solution and execution focused models used by insourced offshore development centres. The classification model contrasts offshore project management with offshore management disintermediation, where staff from offshore organisations are directly managed by onshore client staff. <b>Product</b> <b>ownership</b> is commonly located onshore, but here too, counter examples of offshore <b>product</b> <b>ownership</b> have been found in outsourced service providers and insourced offshore development centres...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} market {{segmentation}} {{is still one}} of the most pervasive in marketing. Among clustering techniques, finite mixture models have gained recognition as a method of segmentation with several advantages over traditional methods; one variant of finite mixture models – the latent class (LC) model – is probably the most popular. The LC approach is innovative and flexible, and can provide suitable solutions to several problems regarding the definition and development of marketing strategies, because it takes into account specific features of the collected data, such as their scale of measure (often ordinal or categorical, rather than continuous), their hierarchical structure and their longitudinal component. Dynamic segmentation is of key importance in many markets where it is unrealistic to assume stationary segments due to the dynamics in consumers’ needs and product choices. In this paper, a mixture latent class Markov model is proposed to dynamically segment Italian households with reference to financial <b>products</b> <b>ownership.</b> The mixture approach is compared with the standard one in terms of its ability to forecast customers’ behaviour in the reference market...|$|R

40|$|Latent growth models {{consider}} both intra-individual {{change and}} inter-individual differences in such change by estimating {{the amount of}} variation across individuals in the latent growth factors (random intercepts and slopes) {{as well as the}} average growth (Kreuter and Muthén, 2008). The assumption of homogeneity in the growth parameters – same parameters for all individuals – does not always correspond to the reality. If heterogeneity exists and is ignored, statistical results can be seriously biased. Mixture modeling aims to unmix the population into an unknown number of latent classes or subpopulations (Duncan et al., 2002). Thus, latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) allows that the population of interest is not homogeneous, but consisting of subpopulations with varying parameters and within-class variation (Muthén, 2006). This paper illustrates the enormous potential of this type of longitudinal latent variable modeling that combines discrete and continuous latent variables. The application estimates the evolution of financial <b>products</b> <b>ownership</b> at household level in Italy in the period 2000 to 2008. We model the binary indicators of ownership (e. g., household owns bonds) as multiple indicators of a latent process that can differ at segment level.
