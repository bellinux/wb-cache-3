Nearly {{a century after}} Born's description, in 1877, the Swedish naturalist Otto Andreas Lowson Mörch proposed a new combination and transferred this taxon to the genus Cassis and subgenus Semicassis. In 1944, the American malacologist William James Clench recombined the species as Phalium (Semicassis) granulatum, and five years later the Brazilian naturalist Frederico Lange de Morretes recombined it as Semicassis granulatum. American malacologist Clifton <b>S.</b> <b>Weaver</b> reallocated it in the subgenus Tylocassis in 1962, though American malacologist R.

The currently accepted combination, Semicassis granulata, was proposed by New Zealand paleontologist Alan Beu, based on paleontological data.|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{the term}} ecotour was first coined {{half a century}} ago, it did not gain {{significant}} currency in the academic tourism literature until the 1990 <b>s</b> (<b>Weaver</b> and Lawton 2007).

These include product-based concepts such as nature-based tourism, management-based concepts such as sustainable tourism, and socially based concepts such as responsible tourism.

40|$|In {{the last}} four decades of the past century Mexico created {{increasingly}} more comprehensive policies for forest management. Yet, mismanagement and environmental degradation continued with no great improvement in production or efficiency. Some of the reasons include poor enforcement of existing laws and regulations, an unwieldy and centralized bureaucracy, regulations that favor short-range plans and investments, and an economy that cannot support sufficient budgets for high-minded plans and utopian ideologies. The results of this pattern of forest management have been damage to the environment, inadequate forest production, an impoverished indigenous and rural people, and a poor export economy.

40|$|Published online 25 February 2016 Increasing {{evidence}} that the maternal environment influences the programming of developing embryos and fetuses through epigenetic mechanisms has significant potential application in the broiler industry. The broiler breeder hen is subjected to restricted-feeding regimes to maximise egg quantity and quality, but the genetically high-intake potential of these birds makes this regime a stressful one. We propose that this stress is signalled to the developing embryo via changes in yolk composition as an evolutionary adaptation to changing environments, and that exposure {{to high levels of}} corticosteroids in ovo is associated with developmental reprogramming, which has effects on the behaviour, health and growth of the progeny. The present paper describes some preliminary results from a series of trials designed to elucidate the relationship between breeder hen diet and egg composition, and the growth, behaviour and immune function of the progeny. We conclude that manipulation of the breeder hen diet is an untapped opportunity to maintain the competitiveness of the chicken meat industry and further, that achieving improved productivity by this means may be compatible with improved animal welfare outcomes for the hen and her progeny.

40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana.

Nevertheless, close examination of its immunophenotypic profile by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) and potential relationship between antigens, as well as histologic grade, has not been extensively assessed by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FC). We examined the immunophenotypic profile, including heavy and light chain analysis, of 41 nodal FL cases with FC analysis and tissue diagnosis. Additionally, MFI of CD 45, CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, and CD 10 were examined. The relationship between the antigen expression on FL cells and normal B cells in the same sample, and any association with each other or with histologic grade, were analyzed statistically. We observed brighter CD 45 and CD 20 expression in FL than normal B cells (P < 0. 0001); dimmer CD 19 in FL than normal B cells (P = 0. 03); brighter CD 20 in grade 2 than grade 1 histology (P = 0. 0023). No correlation was observed between CD 10 MFI and other antigens. Increased expression of CD 20, CD 45, and dim expression of CD 19 are features of nodal FL. FC assessment of MFI detects subtle changes in antigen expression not entirely apparent by visual examination of dot plots or immunohistochemistry.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} has been refined to a crystallographic residual of 16. 1 % at 1. 6 A resolution. The structure has a Kunitz-type fold and {{is composed of}} 12 antiparallel beta-strands, 6 of which form a beta-barrel. One bound sulfate ion has been identified in the model, hydrogen bonded to the side chains of Asn 27, Arg 120, and Lys 125. The side chain of Arg 120 has two conformations, both of which permit hydrogen bonds to the sulfate. This sulfate binding site has been suggested as the binding site for heparin (Eriksson, A. E., Cousens, L. <b>S.,</b> <b>Weaver,</b> L. H., & Matthews, B. W., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3441 - 3445). Two beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) molecules are also included in the model, each forming a disulfide bond to the S gamma atoms of Cys 69 and Cys 92, respectively. The side chain of Cys 92 has two conformations of which only one can bind BME. Therefore the BME molecule is half occupied at this site. The locations of possible sulfate binding sites on the protein were examined by replacing the ammonium sulfate in the crystallization medium with ammonium selenate. Diffraction data were measured to 2. 2 A resolution and the structure refined to an R-factor of 13. 8 %. The binding of the more electron-dense selenate ion was identified at two positions. One position was identical to the sulfate binding site identified previously. The second selenate binding site, which is of lower occupancy, is situated 5. 6 A from the first. This ion is hydrogen bonded by the side chain of Lys 135 and Arg 120. Thus the side chain of Arg 120 binds two selenate ions simultaneously. It is suggested that the observed second selenate binding site should also be considered as a possible binding site for heparin, or that both selenate binding sites might simultaneously contribute to the binding of heparin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the need for a}} pointcut for parallelizable loops in an aspect-oriented programming environment. Several prototype solutions exist for loop pointcuts, but the solutions are not very granular. In particular, they are not able to differentiate between loops that are parallelizable and those that are not. Being able to identify parallelizable loops automatically, as part of an aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 s weaving process, is particularly important because (1) manually identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem and (2) aspectizing parallelized loops can lead to a reduction in code tangling and an increase in separation of concerns. This paper describes the concepts behind the loop-pointcut problem. It then describes the approach used in this study for implementing a solution {{in the form of an}} aspect-oriented Java compiler with a parallelizable loop pointcut. Identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem, and as such, this study 2 ̆ 7 s parallelizable loop pointcut implements a heuristic solution. The pointcut identifies many parallelizable loops as being parallelizable, but in erring on the side of conservatism, there are some parallelizable loops that the pointcut is unable to identify as parallelizable. To test the parallelizable-loop pointcut, the pointcut was applied to a benchmark set of parallelizable programs. There were two versions of each benchmark program - (1) an aspect-oriented version, where the aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weaver</b> added the multi-threading functionality, and (2) a non-aspect-oriented version, where the benchmark program 2 ̆ 7 s source code directly implemented the multi-threading functionality. For each benchmark program, the output from the aspect-oriented version was compared to the output from the non-aspect-oriented version. The study found that each loop that was deemed parallelizable by the aspect-oriented benchmark program was executed in parallel (with multiple threads) by both versions of the program - the aspect-oriented version and the non-aspect-oriented version. There were some loops in the non-aspect-oriented benchmark programs that were deemed parallelizable and executed in parallel, but those same loops were deemed non-parallelizable by their associated aspect-oriented benchmark program. This discrepancy is explained by the study 2 ̆ 7 s conservative approach to identifying loops as parallelizable...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{shearing}} {{of sheep}} is labour-intensive, expensive and presents significant occupational {{health and safety}} risks. The only alternative at present is based on injection of epidermal growth factor, which severs the fibre at the follicle level. This technology cannot be used in pregnant animals and requires application of a net to retain the severed fleece. An alternative is to create a weakened zone within the wool staple, which would be sufficiently strong to retain the fleece on the sheep while a protective covering regrows, but sufficiently weak as to allow painless and automated removal of the fleece. We demonstrate that this approach is possible using mixtures of amino acids lacking lysine and methionine. Initially we demonstrate the relationships between staple strength, a subjective ‘harvestability’ score and a subjective ‘pain’ score, using fleeces from animals treated with varying levels of cortisol to create a wide range of strengths of wool attachment. We assigned a score to the ease with which we could manually break the staples, and also to the animal’s response to breaking the staples still attached to the skin. The relationships between these variables indicated that a staple was considered harvestable and could be removed with minimal skin flinch response at a staple strength of ~ 10 – 13 N/kTex. Staples within this range were then produced by intravenous infusion of mixtures of amino acids lacking in lysine and methionine for a 5 -day period. The weak point was uniformly created across the entire fleece and when a prototype rollerpin device was applied to the weakened wool, it uniformly broke the fleece of the three sheep tested. The mode of action of the amino acid treatment on wool growth was studied. There was no effect of unbalanced amino acids on the rate of follicle bulb cell division, the number of active wool follicles, or the length of the keratinisation zone in the wool follicle. Fibre diameter was reduced by ~ 4 microns by treatment, and intrinsic fibre strength (strength relative to cross-sectional area of the wool fibres), was reduced by ~ 50 %. Results of these trials are encouraging but further work is required to develop a practical, on-farm method of altering systemic amino acid supply and to design an automated, high-throughput system of severing the weakened wool.

40|$|Youth {{environmental}} education (EE) {{is at least}} 40 years old and outdoor education is even older (Carter & Simmons, 2010). While few studies have documented the lasting impacts of these programs on youth participants as they have grown into adulthood, the broad goals of {{environmental education}} to inspire and enable life-long environmental stewardship necessitate such long-term research. Retrospective studies with environmentalists and environmental educators, {{as well as with}} the general public, suggest that childhood experiences in nature are linked to adult environmental attitudes and behaviors (Wells, & Lekies, 2012). These studies provide conceptual support for outdoor and environmental education, but do not document the lasting impacts of specific programs. This dissertation expands on prior research in interpretation (i. e., Knapp, 2007), investigating what past participants remember from a residential outdoor environmental education (ROEE) program, and draws on a new body of literature to explore how participants use these memories in subsequent years. The first article (chapter) is a literature review that summarizes and critiques (1) studies broadly focused on life experiences that have influenced adult environmental attitudes and behaviors and (2) long-term evaluations of interpretive, outdoor education, and environmental education programs. The second article reports data from 45 retrospective interviews with adults who participated in a fifth-grade ROEE program between 1958 and 1992. This paper focuses on what participants remember from the experience, looking specifically at the characteristics of remembered program components. Experiences that were active, offered opportunities for iii achievement, involved social interactions, and were both distinctive and applicable at home were found to be particularly memorable. The third article in this dissertation considers how people use their memories of ROEE, reporting the results of 54 retrospective interviews at two research sites with teens who had attended ROEE programs five years earlier. The psychological literature suggests that autobiographical episodic memories serve directive, social, and self functions (Bluck, 2003), and this dissertation research documents memories of ROEE being used to understand and appreciate wild nature, to direct outdoor recreation and environmental conservation behaviors, and to reminisce with friends. Considered together, the research presented in this dissertation offers insight into how current educators can design memorable programs and then encourage memory use. References Bluck, S. (2003).

40|$|After the {{formation}} of the reservation in 1868, the government issued licenses to regulate trade in wool, textiles, and pelts that traders acquired from Navajos. In 1890, blanket sales were 10 % of wool sales; by 1930, weavers processed one-third of the clip, their textiles were valued at $ 1 million, and provided one-third of reservation income. Only Navajos raised hardy coarse-wooled churros whose wool is ideal for hand processing. Recently analyzed archival evidence reveals that blankets were transformed into rugs when tariff removal (1894 - 97) triggered imports of one billion pounds of duty-free wool, much of it from China. Thus Navajos underwent a unique kind of structural adjustment not experienced by other American growers subject to tariff protection for clothing wools after 1898. Government officials viewed weaving {{as an extension of the}} livestock industry; haphazard attempts to “breed up” Navajo flocks compromised wool quality for hand weavers and textile manufacturers. For decades weavers’ productivity provided a secure means of diversification as traders marketed wool in the form of rugs to cope with volatile fluctuations in the global wool markets. Evidence confirming the consequences of free trade is contained in correspondence among eastern wool brokers and southwest wholesalers, government officials and reservation traders. Their business records reveal that nearly all weaving was marketed by weight until the 1960 <b>s,</b> with <b>weavers</b> receiving three to six times current wool values.

Initially, a modified Franz cell was used, where sections of human nail served as the barrier through which drug penetrated into an agar-filled chamber infected with dermatophytes. A second study was performed using a novel infected nail model where dermatophytes grew into human nail and adenosine triphosphate levels were used as biological marker for antimicrobial activity. The novel enhancing system Recura increased the permeation of both existing drugs through human nail sections mounted in a modified Franz cell. Furthermore, the infected nail model also confirmed that the system also enhanced the permeation through infected nail resulting in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels superior (P ??? 0. 05) to Penlac generic and equivalent (P > 0. 05) to the commercial comparator Jublia. This study demonstrated that with the use of a novel permeation-enhancing formulation base, Recura enhances delivery of miconazole and fluconazole when applied ungually such that the efficacy was equivalent or superior to commercial comparators.

40|$|Introduction Although the “Silk Road” {{is by far}} {{the most}} famous network of trade routes {{connecting}} China, Central Asia, and India, there are other significant, ancient trade routes between these regions of which many may not be aware. One such trade route, known informally as the “wool road”, connected the plains of the Punjab in India to Tibet, Central Asia and China. This route, and several others, passed through the Kullu and Kinnaur regions of the northern Indian state known as Himachal Pradesh. The “wool road”, which was really merely a donkey trail, was the traditional main trade route in the region, and was so important that it was later widened to motorable width to boost trade in the region and came to be known as the Hindustan-Tibet road. Two groups of artisans that can be found along this important route are the weavers of Kullu and Kinnaur. Their strategic location on these routes caused their weaving to be greatly influenced by the ancient trade and traffic along it. Their weaving traditions have a long and intertwined history and their shawls are quite famous throughout India; however, their distinct and skillful weaving is nearly unknown to the outside world. The “Wool Road” The state named “Himachal Pradesh 2 ̆ 2, meaning land of snow, is located in the northernmost part of India, sandwiched between the Indian states of Kashmir to the Northwest, Uttar Pradesh to the South and Punjab to the Southwest. To the East, it forms India 2 ̆ 7 s border with Tibet and Nepal. It is comprised of hilly and mountainous regions with altitudes ranging from 350 to nearly 7, 000 meters above sea level. Although the majority of the population is Hindu, there are a significant number of Buddhists, especially in Kinnaur. Interrelated History of Kinnauri and Kulluvi Weaving It is said that weaving has been practiced in Himachal Pradesh for at least 5, 000 years. Master weaver Dhuni Chand stated that the art of weaving decorative motifs on wool garments began in the Kinnauri village Shubnam, and that the craft came to Kinnaur from Tashkent, in Uzbekistan, via China and Tibet. The fact that Kinnauri weaving was influenced as a result of their location along this busy trade route is evident in many of their traditional motifs, such as the diwar-e-chine (great wall of China). One can say that Kinnauri weaving is the predecessor of the style of weaving for which Kullu is famous. The Kinnauri style of weaving was first introduced to Kullu valley in the 1830 <b>s</b> when <b>weavers</b> from Rupa village in Kinnaur fled to the Kullu valley to escape persecution by the local king. After migrating to the Kullu valley, these weavers continued their craft and were given incentives to teach their patterning techniques to the Kulluvi people. Decoration in Kulluvi weaving, prior to the arrival of the Kinnauris, was restricted to variations in twill weave, checks, and plaids. Their shawls and pattus were devoid of any kind of motifs. Border patterning, as well as the red selvedge border known as the khanni or khushti first appeared on pattus in the 1920 s, about 93 years after the Kinnauris migrated to the Kullu Valley. The intricate patterns decorating the ends of the Kinnauri chhanli, lengcha and dohru were the source of inspiration for Kulluvi motifs. The bright, bold patterns for which Kulluvi shawls and pattus (traditional Kulluvi women’s outer garment) have become famous originated from Kinnauri motifs that were enlarged and simplified over time. Although the weaving techniques of Kinnaur and Kullu are almost identical, the bright, almost florescent, colors and bold, graphic style that have become the hallmark of Kullu weaving are definitely unique and separate from those of Kinnauri weaving...|$|R

40|$|The Silk Route {{has become}} synonymous with the {{movement}} of knowledge that accompanies the trade of objects. Many of the textiles discussed here were not traded along the Silk Route, but all {{are representative of the}} associations that are made with this artery of cultural exchange. The examples cited arrive from a range of cultures and geographies: Indonesia and Nigeria, the Southwest United States and New Zealand. From these vastly different regions, using a variety of materials, weavers painstakingly unpicked yams from woven fabrics for use in other weavings. The term 2 ̆ 7 raveled yam 2 ̆ 7 refers to threads that have been unpicked from a piece of woven cloth and rewoven into another. This paper attempts to determine the reasons behind what seems in the twenty-first century to be such a laborious undertaking. Unpicking fabric to remove flaws, examine the structures involved or possibly recycle precious threads is common. But rarely does the contemporary designer work with materials of such inherent value that time is not considered more valuable. Historically, the reasons for unpicking yarn have been both aesthetic and economic. Penelope 2 ̆ 7 s ruse to stall time by unpicking her daily weaving each night {{may be one of the}} earliest examples. Certain cities developed reputations for deconstructing fabrics for thread such as the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra along the Silk Road which was devoted to the unpicking and reweaving of silk to local fashions. 2 ̆ 2 On a more intimate level the instinct to recover threads from woven materials appears in an example from the other side of the world where slave women and girls in the southern United States are thought to have unwound threads from their owner 2 ̆ 7 s discarded stockings and fabric remnants so that they could use the thread to stylishly wrap around their own hair. As early as 1730 a Danish envoy in Africa wrote, 2 ̆ 2 Opoku bought silk taffeta and materials of all colours. The artists unravelled them so that they obtained large quantities of woolen and silk threads which they mixed with their cotton and got many colours. 2 ̆ 2 In 1817 a British envoy wrote of chiefs 2 ̆ 2 in a general blaze of splendor 2 ̆ 2 who 2 ̆ 2 wore Ashantee cloths, of extravagant price from the costly foreign silks which has been unravelled to weave them in all the varieties of colour, as well as pattern. 2 ̆ 2 In Documents on the Portuguese in Mozambique and Central Africa it is written: Now, the Moors once more make in this land quantities of cotton, much of which is gathered here; they spin it and weave it into white cloth and, since they do not know how to dye, or because they do not have dyes, they take blue painted cloths from Cambay, unravel them and gather the thread into a ball and. with their white weave and with the other they make them painted, from which they obtain a great sum of gold. Finally, the use of raveled yarns is preserved in an Akwete myth from south eastern Nigeria that recounts their use by the group 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> legendary <b>weaver</b> who was alleged to have designed new textile patterns in her dreams. A version of the legend states: She brought threads from Europeans and loosened them to use in her cloth. Some of the threads were silk. Dada Nwakwata originated weaving with imported yarn and producing designs. She worked in secret to avoid others from copying. In many cases value is determined by rarity of fiber or colour. But in other cases a very literal value is at stake, such as the real gold thread brocade (songket) of the Palembang in Sumatra. Due to the economic value of the gold thread it is recycled over and over again. When thread bare weavings are sold by weight, taken apart and incorporated into new pieces. The result of this continuous system of recycling is a dearth of old songkets, for the valuable thread is always being removed and used again...|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} {{in the field of}} {{interaction}} of ultrashort laser pulses with metals. The rapid development of short-pulsed laser systems over the last years offered opportunities for high-precision material processing and structuring {{of a wide range of}} materials – metals, 1 - 3 semiconductors, 4 and organic solids. 5 Besides a variety of practical applications of ultrashort laser pulses they also reveal some new fundamental aspects of laser-beam interactions with matter. Laser ablation is a basic mechanism in a large number of applications for laser processing: cutting, drilling, surface cleaning, pulsed laser deposition of thin films, etc. Recent investigations showed that its theory and modeling are very complex. The process depends strongly on the material’s properties and the parameters of the laser source. Moreover, its theory requires the combination of several different areas of physics. This is why the fundamental physics underlying the laser ablation mechanism is still unclear. Additionally, the description is complicated in the case of ultrashort-pulse laser ablation because of the number of non-thermal processes involved. Many theoretical models have been developed recently, 6 - 8 based generally on the heat conduction equation, hydrodynamics and molecular dynamics, which try to bring to light the basic features of short-pulse laser ablation process. According to these studies, several mechanisms of the ablation process can be realized, depending on the material and laser parameters. Some authors describe the ablation as melting followed by vaporization. Others indicate that a critical pressure gradient, arising in the short time interval after the laser interaction, {{is in the}} origin of the ejection process. In this case, the energy is deposited faster than the time of acoustic wave formation in the system, and the relaxation of the pressure gradient created leads to a significant material removal. On the other hand, if the laser pulse duration is shorter than the time for thermal relaxation of the system, defined by the thermal diffusion, overheating of the system can take place. Then, the temperature in the material reaches the critical point and a fast transition to a gaseous-liquid phase (phase explosion) occurs. Experimentally, basic properties and dynamics of ultrashort laser ablation have not yet been established, and experiments that focus on the ablated species are still rare. A few studies recently published have limited themselves to establish the presence of different species in the ablated plasma plume, namely ions, neutral atoms and nanoparticles. 9 - 11 In the present context the formation of: i) nanoparticles with a diameter in the  1 - 10 nm range; ii) sub-keV to keV ions, during ultrashort laser ablation of solid targets, constitute aspects on great interest, due to their possible applications. In fact, the former (i) could open up new route to the production of nanoparticles resulting of special interest in the field of nanophysics and nanotechnology, while the latter (ii) is considered particularly promising for the current deficiency of sub-keV high-flux ion beams delivered by presently available commercial techniques. The main goals of the project are concentrated on: •	development of a reliable numerical method based on Molecular dynamics simulation technique describing interaction of the ultrashort (< 10 ps) laser radiation with metals; •	detailed investigation of the process of ultrashort laser ablation of metals, including mechanisms of ablation, processes involved in the target material – phase transitions, shock wave evolution, crater formation, structure and evolution of the ablated material; •	detailed experimental investigations of the characteristics of laser ablation driven by ultrashort laser pulses through the analysis of the ejected material, as well as on their variation as a function of the laser pulse characteristics (energy density, wavelength, e. g.). The result obtained in the frame of the project can be used in different areas of application of ultrashort lasers – precise micromachining, pulsed laser deposition of thin films, nanoparticles generation, etc., as well as they can reveals the physical nature of the processes involved.
