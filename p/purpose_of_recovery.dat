Our contribution is threefold: (1) We provide a slightly refined variant of the algorithm yielding improved bounds on the skew {{that can be achieved}} and the sustainable frequency offsets. (2) We show how to extend the technique to also synchronize clock rates. This permits less frequent communication without significant loss of precision, provided that clock rates change sufficiently slowly. (3) We present a coupling scheme that allows to make these algorithms self-stabilizing while preserving their high precision.

40|$|In {{the event}} of a disaster, {{communities}} become the targets of specialist organisations and a concentration of activities. The complex unstructured activities and routines of daily life are disrupted and even totally overwhelmed by a single catastrophic event that requires a redirection of priorities, resources and people to deal with all aspects of the disaster impact as rapidly as possible. The whole community must be mobilised to restore functions and meet needs, to return to the normality of the pre-disaster state. This latter purpose is least likely to be achieved, as the destroyed community can seldom rebuild to the same complex, but randomly haphazard state that existed before the disaster. The mobilisation of the whole community to the single <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> requires a high level of organisation. Response to a disaster demands that there be purposeful organisations ready to provide leadership and action. Emergency management is predicated for the existence of such purposeful organisations. However, while organisations are at the core of emergency management response and recovery, they are by no means simple or singular. Disaster generates a plethora of organisations, which interact with the community rather than simply organising disaster response. The community also organises itself, re-assigning priorities and using existing organisations and networks...|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{important}} pre-processing steps in optical coherence tomography (OCT) is reducing speckle noise, resulting from multiple scattering of tissues, which degrades the quality of OCT images. Materials and Methods The present study focused on speckle noise reduction and edge detection techniques. Statistical filters with different masks and noise variances were applied on OCT and test images. Objective evaluation of both types of images was performed, using various image metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), root mean square error, correlation coefficient and elapsed time. For the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery,</b> Kuan filter was used as an input for edge enhancement. Also, a spatial filter was applied to improve image quality. Results The obtained results were presented as statistical tables and images. Based on statistical measures and visual quality of OCT images, Enhanced Lee filter (3 × 3) with a PSNR value of 43. 6735 in low noise variance and Kuan filter (3 × 3) with a PSNR value of 37. 2850 in high noise variance showed superior performance over other filters. Conclusion Based on the obtained results, by using speckle reduction filters such as Enhanced Lee and Kuan filters on OCT images, the number of compounded images, required to achieve a given image quality, could be reduced. Moreover, use of Kuan filters for promoting the edges allowed smoothing of speckle regions, while preserving image tissue texture...|$|E

40|$|Composting {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular {{in the past decade}} as a biological treatment process of organic solid wastes, generated from different sources, with the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery,</b> stabilization and volume reduction of waste material in the form of compost. In this study, the effect of different modes of aeration on composting of solid waste using two heat insulated closed pilot-scale reactors was investigated. The modes of aeration studied were upflow, downflow, alternate upflow/downflow, and internal recirculation in a single-reactor system as well as reuse of spent air in a two-reactor system in series. Composting tests were performed in two stages of 20 - 30 days duration each. Temperature at different heights of the composting mass as well as air velocity were continuously monitored by a datalogger. Air flow was continuous or intermittent depending on temperature. Oxygen content in the spent air was regularly measured. The results show that (i) the application of unidirectional upflow or downflow aeration creates significant vertical distribution of temperature in the composting mass; and (ii) internal recirculation of air in a single-reactor system and reuse of spent air in a two-reactor system appeared to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution and thereby accelerated degradation of the organic matter. Practical applications in composting plants are discussed. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Where {{a person}} (D) {{who has become}} liable to pay another person (P) seeks from a third person (R) {{restitution}} of {{all or part of}} the payment, if the different relationships involved between P, D and R are decided in different forums or under different governing laws, D may not be able to obtain satisfactory recovery from R because the same issues may be determined differently or because there may be a mismatch between different governing laws. This thesis examines the rules of private international law relevant to such situations and proposes some reforms of the law. Thus if the same issues have to be determined in P's claim against D and in D's claim against R independently from each other in different forums, matters that have been established to support P's claim against D may not be established in support of D's claim against R. We will examine whether matters established in P's action against D in a foreign forum are recognised as conclusive against R in D's action against R in England. Then, we will examine in the international context English third party procedure as another way of avoiding independent determination of the same issues. Turning to the obstacles to satisfactory recovery caused by a mismatch of different governing laws, we will first consider whether different claims of recovery that D may have against R should be governed by a single governing law. We will, then, consider whether the contract between P and D and the contract between D and R involved in chain transactions should be referred to a single governing law. Finally, we will consider whether D's liability to P and R's liability to P should be determined by a single governing law for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978...|$|E

Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenalin, is a catecholamine neurotransmitter. Administering a norepinephrine receptor agonist (a substance that initiates a cell response when it binds with a receptor) to patients promoted the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> memory and many other cognitive functions after a traumatic brain injury. Conversely, the administration of norpinephrine antagonists slowed recovery, and could lead to the reinstatement of deficits when administered after recovery. Noradrenergic antagonists were not prescribed for the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> slowing the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> memory. Rather, these findings are based on the effects of other commonly prescribed drugs that happen to block noradrenergic receptors. The alpha-1 adrenergic receptor is specifically implicated. Although it has not yet been thoroughly investigated, there is potential for stimulants, which promote catecholamine release, to be an effective treatment in the early stages <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> from brain trauma, and these positive effects could reduce the symptoms of PTA.|$|R
