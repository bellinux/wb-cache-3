5000|$|Several {{poems in}} Laurence’s {{selection}} for More Poems {{had already been}} considered by Housman for his previous collections, even reaching the <b>page</b> <b>proof</b> stage, before being rejected as not meeting his editorial aims there. Among them was the earnest “The Sage to the Young Man” (4), with its old fashioned forms of address, originally destined for A Shropshire Lad. It had, however, been published anonymously {{at a later date}} in the school magazine The Edwardian (April 1916). [...] Five more, Poems 18, 26, 33, 45 and 46, had been intended for Last Poems. Among work taken from old publications, Poem 48 was one of the earliest, having appeared as “Parta Quies”, under his initials only, in Waifs and Strays (March 1881). With textual variants, it was retitled “Alta Quies” for More Poems but the original title and text were restored in Collected Poems (1939).|$|E
40|$|Henry Yule {{spent more}} than two years (1883 - 1885) {{reviewing}} and revising the <b>page</b> <b>proofs</b> of the Hobson-Jobson, during which time he also engaged in frequent correspondence with James Murray as the latter was editing the early fasicicles of the New English Dictionary (NED). Murray's consultations with Yule on topics pertaining to India, Ceylon, and Malaya eventually prompted Yule to send Murray a copy of the Hobson-Jobson's <b>page</b> <b>proofs,</b> from which Murray extracted numerous definitions and quotations, as he openly acknowledged (see also Nagle [forthcoming]) : Colonel Yule has generously allowed us the use of the proofs of his Discursive Glossary of Anglo-Indian Colloquial Terms, an important work now in the press, which has often been of service in helping to complete the history of such of these words as fall within our province (Murray 1885, vi). Yule, too, mentioned their corresponsnce in his preface: Dr. J. A. H. Murray, editor of the great English Dictionary, has also been most kind and courteous in the interchange of communications, a circumstance which will account for a few cases in which the passages cited in both works are the same (Yule 1886, ix-x). Yet since the Hobson-Jobson was already in <b>page</b> <b>proofs</b> when the bulk of the Yule-Murray correspondence took place, there was not much opportunity for Murray and the NED to have influenced Yule's work. Or was there? The recently discovered <b>page</b> <b>proofs</b> of the Hobson-Jobson reveal that Yule made substantial changes to his book at the proof stage, during the height of his correspondence with Murray. This paper examines these changes and the Murray-Yule correspondence, and illustrates the extent of the influence that these men had on each other's work.
