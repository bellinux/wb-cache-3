60|$|In fact, {{immediately}} after Caligula was killed, and the tidings {{of his death}} began to spread about the palace and into {{the streets of the}} city, a considerable tumult arose, the precursor and earnest of the dissensions that were to follow. Upon the first alarm, a body of the emperor's guards that had been accustomed to attend upon his person, and whom he had strongly attached to himself by his lavish generosity in bestowing <b>presents</b> <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> upon them, rushed forward to defend him, or if it should prove too late to defend him, to avenge his death. These soldiers ran toward the palace, and when they found that the emperor had been killed, they were furious with rage, and fell upon all whom they met, and actually slew several men. Tidings came to the theater, and the word was spread from rank to rank among the people that the emperor was slain. The people did not, however, at first, believe the story. They supposed that the report was a cunning contrivance of the emperor himself, intended to entrap them into some expression of pleasure and gratification, on their part, at his death, in order to give him an excuse for inflicting some cruel punishment upon them. The noise and tumult in the streets soon convinced them, however, that something extraordinary had occurred; they learned that the news of the emperor's death was really true, and almost {{immediately after}}ward they found, to their consternation, that the furious guards were thundering at the gates of the theater, and endeavoring to force their way in, in order to wreak their vengeance on the assembly, as if the spectators at the show were accomplices of the crime.|$|E

40|$|Many people fail to save {{what they}} will need for retirement. Research on {{excessive}} discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with <b>present</b> <b>and</b> future <b>rewards</b> but with <b>present</b> <b>and</b> future selves. In line with research that shows that people may fail, {{because of a lack}} of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones...|$|R
40|$|The present {{experimental}} study (n= 195) examined how manipulating exposure to <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> punishments affects {{the relationship between}} approach personality traits, values, and risk-taking behavior. Multi-group {{analysis was used to}} investigate the influence of presenting rewards prior to punishments (Group 1) <b>and</b> <b>presenting</b> punishments prior to rewards (Group 2) on risk-taking behavior, in people with different personality traits and values. Specifically, we assessed wither the relationships between traits, values, and risk-taking behaviour was dependent on the order at which participants were <b>presented</b> with <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> punishments. The online laboratory study revealed that the value ‘Stimulation’ was positively associated with risk-taking behavior during the ‘reward then punishment’ condition and that the value ‘Hedonism’ was positively associated with risk-taking behavior during the ‘punishment then reward’ condition. The results also demonstrated that approach personality dimensions significantly predict values of Hedonism and Stimulation in both conditions.

40|$|With life {{expectancy}} dramatically increasing {{throughout much of}} the world, people have to make choices with a longer future in mind than they ever had to before. Yet, many indicators suggest that undersaving for the long term often occurs: in America, for instance, many individuals {{will not be able to}} maintain their preretirement standard of living in retirement. Previous research has tried to understand problems with intertemporal choice by focusing on the ways in which people treat <b>present</b> <b>and</b> future <b>rewards.</b> In this paper, the author reviews a burgeoning body of theoretical and empirical work that takes a different viewpoint, one that focuses on how perceptions of the self over time can dramatically affect decision making.

40|$|Markov reward {{models have}} {{interesting}} modeling applications, particularly those addressing fault-tolerant hardware/software systems. In this paper, we consider a Markov reward {{model with a}} reward structure including only reward rates associated with states, in which both positive <b>and</b> negative <b>reward</b> rates are <b>present</b> <b>and</b> null <b>reward</b> rates are allowed, and develop a numerical method to compute the distribution function of the cumulative reward till exit of a subset of transient states of the model. The method combines a model transformation step with {{the solution of the}} transformed model using a randomization construction with two randomization rates. The method introduces a truncation error, but that error is strictly bounded from above by a user-specified error control parameter. Further, the method is numerically stable and takes advantage of the sparsity of the infinitesimal generator of the transformed model. Using a Markov reward model of a fault-tolerant hardware/software system, we illustrate the application of the method and analyze its computational cost. Also, we compare the computational cost of the method with that of the (only) previously available method for the problem. Our numerical experiments seem to indicate that the new method can be efficient and that for medium-size and large models can be substantially faster than the previously available method.

40|$|The co-evolution of {{morphology}} {{and control}} for virtual crea-tures enables {{the creation of}} a novel form of gameplay and procedural content generation. Starting with a creature evolved to perform a simple task such as locomotion and removing its brain, the remaining body can be employed in a compelling interactive control problem. Just as we en-joy the challenge <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> of mastering helicopter flight or learning to play a musical instrument, learning to con-trol such a creature through manual activation of its actu-ators <b>presents</b> an engaging <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> puzzle. Impor-tantly, the novelty of this challenge is inexhaustible, since the evolution of virtual creatures provides a way to proce-durally generate content for such a game. An endless series of creatures can be evolved for a task, then have their brains removed to become the game’s next human-control chal-lenge. To demonstrate this new form of gameplay and con-tent generation, a proof-of-concept game—tentatively titled Darwin’s Avatars—was implemented using evolved creature content, and user tested. This implementation also provided a unique opportunity to compare human and evolved control of evolved virtual creatures, both qualitatively and quanti-tatively, with interesting implications for improvements and future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{two most}} {{influential}} models in delay discounting research {{have been the}} exponential (E) and hyperbolic (H) models. We develop a new methodology to design binary choice questions such that exponential and hyperbolic discount rates can be purposefully manipulated to make their rate parameters orthogonal (Pearson’s R = 0), negatively correlated (R = – 1), positively correlated (R = + 1), or to hold one rate constant while allowing the other to vary. Then we extend the method to similarly contrast {{different versions of the}} hyperboloid model. The arithmetic discounting model (A), which is based on differences between <b>present</b> <b>and</b> future <b>rewards</b> rather than their ratios, may easily be made orthogonal to any other pair of models. Our procedure makes it possible to design choice stimuli that precisely vary the relationship between different discount rates. However, the additional control over the correlation between different discount rate parameters may require the researcher to either restrict the range that those rate parameters can take, or to expand the range of times the participant must wait for future rewards...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to identify the neural architecture involved in pain infliction <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> giving. Moreover, this study aimed to examine whether this effect varied as a function of group-membership. It was hypothesised that neural mechanisms involved in pain processing (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) and perspective taking (medial prefrontal cortex) would show increased activity while participants inflict pain onto others. Additionally, neural networks involved in reward processing (medial orbitofrontal cortex, ventral and dorsal striatum) were expected to show increased activity while participants gave rewards to others. In order to test this, two Brisbane universities were used as the experimental in-group (UQ) and out-group (QUT). While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants watched as an in-group and out-group student competed on a difficult trivia task. Participants delivered an electroshock, monetary reward or nothing in accordance to students’ answers. In line with predictions, it was found that neural mechanisms involved in pain, perspective taking <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> processing were activated while participants <b>presented</b> electroshocks <b>and</b> monetary <b>rewards</b> to others. Additionally, the more participants identified with the in-group, compared to the out-group, the more anterior cingulate cortex activation they experienced while shocking other in-group members compared to out-group members, indicating stronger empathy for the in-group. No such group differences were found for rewarding. Our results suggest that in painful situations we sympathise more with the in-group but experience general satisfaction while sharing rewards with others...|$|R

40|$|AbstractResearch has {{increasingly}} implicated the striatum in {{the processing of}} reward-related information in both animals and humans.

We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate hemodynamic responses to monetary <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> punishments in three experiments that made use of an oddball paradigm. We <b>presented</b> <b>reward</b> <b>and</b> punishment displays randomly in time, following an anticipatory cue, or following a button press response. Robust and differential activation of the caudate nucleus occurred only when a perception of contingency existed between the button press response and the outcome.
