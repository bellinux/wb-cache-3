50|$|The <b>plumbeous</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas plumbea) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The {{ruddy pigeon}} is 28 cm (11 in) long and weighs 170 g. It is unpatterned and mainly wine-purple in colour, {{becoming}} more rufous on the back. The tail and primary flight feathers are dark brown, {{the bill is}} black, and the legs are purple-red. The iris is typically red, but can, {{at least in the}} Amazon basin, sometimes be dull yellow (however, due to the red eye-ring, the iris never appears as conspicuously white as in adults of the sympatric subspecies of the <b>plumbeous</b> <b>pigeon,</b> P. plumbea). The female is slightly duller and browner than the male, and the juvenile bird has a greyish brown head, neck and breast, with cinnamon or rufous scaling on the head and upperparts.|$|E
