40|$|The hot {{corrosion}} {{behavior of the}} B 2 nickel aluminides was studied to determine the inherent {{hot corrosion}} resistance of the beta nickel aluminides {{and to develop a}} mechanism for the hot corrosion of the beta nickel aluminides. The effects of the <b>prior</b> <b>processing</b> of the material, small additions of zirconium, stoichiometry of the materials, and preoxidation of the samples were also examined. Additions of 2, 5, and 15 w/o chromium were used to determine the effect of chromium on the hot corrosion of the beta nickel aluminides and the minimum amount of chromium necessary for good hot corrosion resistance. The results indicate that the beta nickel aluminides have inferior inherent hot corrosion resistance despite their excellent oxidation resistance. <b>Prior</b> <b>processing</b> and zirconium additions had no discernible effect on the hot corrosion resistance of the alloys. Preoxidation extended the incubation period of the alloys only a few hours and was not considered to be an effective means of stopping hot corrosion. Stoichiometry was a major factor in determining the hot corrosion resistance of the alloys with the higher aluminum alloys having a definitely superior hot corrosion resistance. The addition of chromium to the alloys stopped the hot corrosion attack in the alloys tested. From a variety of experimental results, a complex hot corrosion mechanism was proposed. During {{the early stages of the}} hot corrosion of these alloys the corrosion is dominated by a local sulphidation/oxidation form of attack. During the intermediate stages of the hot corrosion, the aluminum depletion at the surface leads to a change in the oxidation mechanism from a protective external alumina layer to a mixed nickel-aluminum spinel and nickel oxide that can occur both externally and internally. The material undergoes extensive cracking during the later portions of the hot corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Background: The leishmanicidal and {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} ten essential oils obtained from ten plant specimens were evaluated.

Results: Seven essential oils exhibited activity against Leishmania parasites, five of which were toxic against J 774 macrophages. Selectivity indices of > 6 and 13 were calculated for the essential oils of Ocimum basilicum and Origanum vulgare, respectively. Conclusion: The essential oil of Ocimum basilicum was active against promastigotes of Leishmania and innocuous to J 774 macrophages at concentrations up to 1600 µg/mL and should be further investi­gated for leishmanicidal activity in others in vitro and in vivo experimental models...|$|E
