5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E

25|$|With {{the profit}} motive {{eradicated}} by the revolution, the superficial tolerance of LGBT persons by the strongly homophobic Cuban society quickly evaporated. Emigration to Miami began immediately, including {{lesbians and gay men}} who had worked for United States firms or had done domestic work for the native bourgeoisie. LGBT <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had lived largely abroad moved away permanently.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory is}} {{that there may be}} shared risk factors that can lead to both {{substance}} abuse and mental illness. Mueser hypothesizes that these may include factors such as social isolation, poverty, lack of structured daily activity, lack of adult role responsibility, living in areas with high drug availability, and association with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> misuse drugs.|$|E
25|$|It builds {{upon the}} QWERTY layout as a base, {{changing}} {{the positions of}} 17 keys while retaining the QWERTY positions of most non-alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts, supposedly {{making it easier to}} learn than Dvorak for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> type in QWERTY without sacrificing efficiency.

25|$|The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 {{had many}} strategies. The law {{authorized}} and had provisions that included {{topics such as}} loan repayment programs and scholarships, providing more grants to the nursing students, making more public service announcements about nursing and educating the public on what a great profession it is and making nursing school more flexible by creating options for the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> have a degree but {{would like to go}} into nursing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed the earliest writings {{had the advantage}} of being checked by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> knew the text by heart, for they had learned it {{at the time of the}} revelation itself and had subsequently recited it constantly. Since the official compilation was completed several decades after Muhammad's death, the Uthman text has been scrupulously preserved. Bucaille believed that this did not give rise to any problems of this Quran's authenticity.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, Romney {{indicated}} that he might retain parts of Obamacare such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, but this was quickly clarified as only ensuring insurance coverage for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had insurance coverage. In September 2012, Romney highlighted his success in providing government subsidizes to ensure medical coverage for all the children of Massachusetts. And in October the Romney campaign questioned the assumptions behind a Commonwealth Fund report that Romney's policies would provide health care insurance for 45 million fewer Americans than Obama's policies.|$|E

25|$|Sesame {{seeds and}} sesame oil are a serious {{allergen}} to some people, including infants. In Australia, {{the occurrence of}} allergy to sesame seed {{was estimated to be}} 0.42% among all children, while in the United Kingdom, the allergic reaction was found to affect 0.04% of adults. The occurrence of allergy to sesame in patients with some form of food allergy was found to be much higher than in the general population, ranging from 0.5% in Switzerland to 8.5% in Australia. In other words, allergy to sesame affects a small percentage of overall human population, but sesame allergy is high in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> show symptoms of allergy to other foods.|$|E
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E

They declared that [...] "The two properties {{have nothing in}} common but a gorilla, a captive woman, a male rescuer, and a building scenario." [...] Further, the court ruled that [...] "The 'Kong' and 'King Kong' names are widely used by the general public and are associated with apes and other objects of enormous proportions." [...] As for Universal's survey, the court found it unconvincing, as Universal did not own the [...] "image [...] [...] [...] of King Kong climbing the Empire State Building/World Trade Center with Fay Wray/Jessica Lange in his paw" [...] and that by only soliciting opinions from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had Donkey Kong games, the survey failed to establish confusion from potential customers.

500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's visuals. Entertainment Weekly Adam B. Vary thought the game {{did a good}} job at recreating {{the look and feel of}} the {{original}} manga. Walter called the game's visuals [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "striking", and thought that they were what would get people from places where the manga had not yet become popular interested in the game. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell described the visuals as distinctive, and at times reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. Smith called GioGio's Bizarre Adventure among the most faithful manga-to-video game adaptations he had seen, praising the 3D recreation of the manga's artwork, and said that its use of effects such as speed lines and visual katakana sound effects made it feel familiar. He noted that the environments looked [...] "a little crude" [...] and with blurry textures if one looked at details up close, but that they looked impressive from a distance. Reviewers at Famitsu also enjoyed how the game reproduced the look of the manga in 3D, but noted that the presentation of the story felt insufficient for people who have not read the Vento Aureo manga, and that it seemed mostly targeted towards <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> were fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.|$|E
500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, while {{continuing}} to pursue some of the core themes of his earlier works, Giddens has become preoccupied {{with the impact of}} the digital revolution (DR) on world society and on everyday life. That revolution, he argues, must not be identified solely {{with the advent of the}} internet, extraordinary though that is. Rather the DR is a massive wave of change washing across the world, driven by the interrelation between the internet, robotics and supercomputers. It is huge algorithmic power – available to the billions of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> possess smartphones – that connects the other two.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice of}} {{structures}} {{is affected by}} timing: an adult who has been present throughout a child's life {{is likely to have}} a more parental relationship with that child than one who enters a relationship with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>already</b> have a teenage child. (The issues involved often parallel those of step-parenting.) The degree of logistical and emotional involvement between the members of the relationship is also important: a close-knit triad already living under one roof with shared finances is far more likely to take a collective approach to parenting than would a larger, loose-knit group with separate living arrangements: ...|$|E

He said [...] "If it were legally possible, I'd say no more Muslims will get in here", claiming that the influx of Muslims would threaten freedoms in the liberal Dutch society. He thought Muslim culture had never undergone a process of modernisation and therefore still lacked acceptance of democracy and women's, gays', lesbians' and minorities' rights. He feared Muslims would try to replace the Dutch legal system with the shari'a law.|$|E
