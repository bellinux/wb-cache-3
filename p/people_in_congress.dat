During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I wish they would... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that." ...|$|E

When it comes to global warming, for instance, Representative Holt says we don't need <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> who understand atmospheric pressure, or glaciation. We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know. And that, he says, is thinking like a scientist." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of October 17, 2008, Tinklenberg's opponent, Bachmann, {{appeared}} on Hardball with Chris Matthews. She said she was [...] "very concerned that Obama may have anti-American views," [...] and called for the news media to [...] "do a penetrating expose" [...] on [...] "the views of the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America?" [...] Tincklenburg's total fundraising before the Bachmann appearance was approximately $1 million, under $720,000 of which was from individuals. [...] Prior to Bachmann's remarks, Democrats had already planned to spend $1,000,000 against the Republican incumbent after Tinklenberg had reached the milestone of raising $1,000,000 on his own. [...] Nevertheless, Bachmann won re-election, by just under 3 percentage points.|$|E

5000|$|On [...] the {{regional}} executive committee adopted a declaration about {{the assembly of}} the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets on [...] in Kiev. The created organizational bureau has developed standards of representation assuming that to the congress will arrive around 500 <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>congress</b> should have participated representatives of all councils of workers', peasants', and soldiers' deputies from guberniyas, counties, and cities including ones that were under influence of Ukrainian parties. However, after the representation standards a great advantage was given to delegates from councils of industrial regions and big cities where Bolsheviks had the biggest influence. On the other hand, a peasant's representation was so limited {{that it was going}} to be even smaller than in the Fourth State Duma under the Tsar regime.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, presidential {{candidate}} Donald Trump made {{a proposal to}} ban all Muslims from entering the United States (as part of the War on Terror); Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act was cited as a possible justification. The proposal created international controversy, drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in United States presidential elections. A former Reagan Administration aide noted that, despite criticism of Trump's proposal to invoke the law, [...] "the Alien Enemies Act... {{is still on the}} books... (and <b>people)</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> for many decades (haven’t) repealed the law... (nor has) Barack Obama". Other critics claimed that the proposal violated founding principles, and was unconstitutional for singling out a religion, and not a hostile nation. They included the Pentagon and others, who argued that the proposal (and its citation of the Alien Enemies proclamations as authority) played into the ISIL narrative that the United States was at war with the entire Muslim religion (not just with ISIL and other terrorist entities).|$|E

Nancy Pelosi you have a Troika of the most leftist administration {{in the history of our}} country." [...] In reference to Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's comment about [...] "pro-America areas of this great nation", Bachmann was asked which areas are anti-American and responded [...] "I don’t think it's geography. I think it is people who don’t like America, who detest America ... you’ll find them in all walks of life all throughout America." [...] When asked by Matthews about the Democratic Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader, Bachmann said [...] "I am not going to say if they are anti-American or pro-American." [...] When asked [...] "How many people in the Congress of the United States do you suspect as being anti-American?" [...] she replied [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I wish they would.

5000|$|JIM: If {{you were}} to make your case for {{deflation}} right now, {{what would be the}} key factors supporting that view?BOB: The credit bubble: {{the fact that we do}} not have currency inflation as much as we have credit inflation. And credit bubbles have always imploded. The amount of dollars out there that are greenbacks - actual cash - is [...] compared to the dollar value of credit instruments. So in my view the Fed is utterly powerless to prevent the ultimate deflation of the credit bubble. And some people say, “Well, they can print money.” Fine, that would just make the credit bubble collapse faster as soon as bond holders realize that’s what they were doing. There’s no way out of it. So that’s the argument....BOB: Well, the hyperinflation part is a pure guess based on politics. It has nothing to do with reading markets. I think the markets are telegraphing deflation, and I’m very confident about that. Hyperinflation to me is going to be the natural political response. I mean these <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> are so irresponsible - except to themselves and their families, of course. They always get reelected so they’re doing that correctly. I mean, it’s working for them as individuals but it’s not working for the country. Anyway, to save their own skins I think the most likely thing is that they will turn to the Treasury, whether they keep the Federal Reserve System or not, and say, “Let’s print, let’s get the machines going and print those greenbacks and spread them around.” ...|$|E

40|$|This issue brief {{discusses}} office {{holding and}} socio economic status in federal representation in Congress. It also touches {{the issues of}} minorities and office holding. Key Points Class/SES {{plays an important role}} in the opportunity to be elected to office in Congress Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives on average are wealthier then the average American citizen Due to disproportions in wealth, minority groups are underrepresented in Congress Affluent members in Congress are represented in both the Democratic and Republican party Class is not the only thing needed to be elected into office Issue Brief Although the “wealthy ” class doesn’t start at having $ 1, 000, 000 net worth, it is an easy marker and therefore will be the main divide in this issue brief. Focusing mainly on Congress, being in a higher class can be linked to being in office. However, being rich doesn’t make you more likely to be in any one party. In the United States population, roughly 2, 886, 200 people have over $ 1, 000, 000 in net worth. That’s out of more then 310 million people, which comes out to be around. 62 % of the total population being millionaires. Congress has 535 members and 237 millionaires. Of the entire Congress, 44 % are millionaires, which is extremely higher then the total population. Of the top ten richest <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> 8 are Democratic and 2 are Republican but there is no obvious trend in the overall 237 between party lines.
