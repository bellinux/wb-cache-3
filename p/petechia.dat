5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica <b>petechia),</b> and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves also support 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea if left {{untreated}} may last {{for weeks or}} months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or <b>petechia,</b> septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. This occurs in between 0.6 and 3% of infected women and 0.4 and 0.7% of infected men.|$|E
25|$|A contusion, {{commonly}} known as a bruise, {{is a type of}} hematoma of tissue in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Bruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. Bruises are {{not to be confused with}} other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation. These lesions include <b>petechia</b> (< 3nbsp&mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus), purpura (3nbsp&mm to 1nbsp&cm, classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia), and ecchymosis (>1nbsp&cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital ecchymosis, e.g.,"raccoon eyes", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>petechiae</b> {{in a child}} with an unexplained injury should raise the practitioner's concern about possible non-accidental injury and prompt further inquiry. Absence of <b>petechiae</b> is not helpful in excluding non-accidental injury. In non-accidental injury, <b>petechiae</b> {{are most likely to}} be found on the head and neck, and usually in association with other bruises. Among the 28 cases in which <b>petechiae</b> were associated with non-accidental injury in our study, patterning of <b>petechiae</b> was noted in a quarter.

The documentation of the presence of <b>petechiae</b> on a victim can help police investigators prove the case.

40|$|Petechial {{bleeding}} of conjunctivae and eyelids is {{a typical}} finding in different causes of death. <b>Petechiae</b> can be important corroborative evidence of asphyxia. In some studies the authors found <b>petechiae</b> following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and concluded that <b>petechiae</b> was developed from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Other authors contradict this theory. During a period of 30 months, 196 patients with in life-threatening situations (of different, natural causes) were examined for petechial bleeding of conjunctivae and eyelids before, directly after and 122 (62 %) patients after 24 hours following CPR. In only 12 (6, 12 %) of 196 cases <b>petechiae</b> was registered. 8 (4 %) of them had <b>petechiae</b> before starting the CPR. In 3 of 4 cases the patients survived CPR and the finding of <b>petechiae</b> {{was a result of}} the intensive medical treatment in the hospital. In 0, 5 % of all cases petechial bleeding of conjunctivae and eyelids was found. This only case couldnt be explained by the documentary material of it. With great probability, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation normaly does not generate petechial bleeding of conjunctivae and eyelids in adults...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{acceleration}} {{can cause}} petechial hemorrhages, called G measles. <b>Petechiae</b> usually start to develop between 5 and 9 G {{with a high}} interindividual variance. Centrifuge training delays the onset to higher G levels. One might expect onset at lower G levels after bed rest; however, {{there is no evidence}} in the literature. A case of <b>petechiae</b> formation after bed rest is presented here. Case report: Orthostatic tolerance was tested using a tilt table and lower body negative pressure before and after bed rest in both campaigns of a 2 3 21 -d bed rest study with 6 ° head-down tilt. A 42 -yr-old male Caucasian without any history of thrombosis, venous disease, hemorrhage, or <b>petechiae,</b> and with a negative thrombophilia screening, took part in the bed rest study as 1 out of 10 subjects. He was the only one to develop <b>petechiae</b> during the orthostatic tests after, but not before, bed rest in both campaigns. <b>Petechiae</b> were distributed throughout the lower legs and most pronounced at the shin in a stocking-like fashion, surprisingly reoccurring in an identical pattern of distribution. <b>Petechiae</b> appeared slowly over minutes during hyperemia. Discussion: This case indicates that prolonged bed rest decreases the threshold for <b>petechiae</b> formation. A reproducible distribution pattern suggests that factors predisposing to <b>petechiae</b> formation keep their local distribution over time (possibly due to local vessel structures). Mechanisms of adaptation and interindividual variance are unclear. Findings are of clinical relevance as such cases might occur after prolonged bed rest in patients without need of expensive testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of crush asphyxia typically {{relies on a}} history of chest or abdominal compression with the finding of skin <b>petechiae</b> and congestion. The following three cases of crush asphyxia demonstrate a distinctive pattern of <b>petechiae</b> and congestion associated with close-fitting clothing: Case 1, a 49 -year-old woman who was crushed under a large hay bale; Case 2, a 35 -year-old woman who was crushed between a wall and a car; Case 3, a 49 -year-old woman who was crushed between a crane and {{the side of a}} truck. At autopsy in all three cases there were facial, conjunctival, neck and upper anterior chest <b>petechiae.</b> However, few or no <b>petechiae,</b> and reduced congestion, were observed in areas beneath the victims' brassieres. Deaths in these cases were all due to crush asphyxia, with the pattern of <b>petechiae</b> on the chests of the victims influenced by close-fitting clothing that had compressed cutaneous vasculature. This brassiere 'sign' provided a readily observable and easily recordable sign of crush asphyxia due to chest compression, and illustrated that vascular engorgement is necessary for the development of <b>petechiae</b> in these circumstances...|$|R

Prof. Lippi concludes that this account “supports the conclusion of poisoning” of a previous work, because “skin eruption (such as <b>petechiae),</b> fever and swelling are symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning. ” In acute arsenic poisoning, skin rash is described, but only in the form of flushing erythema or maculopapular eruption.
