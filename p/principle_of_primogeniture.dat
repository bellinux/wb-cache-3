5|$|Grand Prince Géza died in 997. Stephen convoked an {{assembly}} at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern {{regions of the}} Carpathian Basin; {{the rest of the}} territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture,</b> which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty, which was Koppány at that time. Koppány, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture,</b> meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} share it with his brothers.|$|E
5|$|The couple's first better {{documented}} child, Princess Elene, {{was born}} in 1753, followed by 22 more between 1755 and 1782. As her sons grew up, Darejan's desire to secure the right of succession for her offspring against Heraclius's eldest surviving son of his second marriage to Anna Abashidze, the Crown Prince George, became the cornerstone of Darejan's involvement {{in the politics of}} Georgia. In the last years of Heraclius II's life, she became more involved and influential. In 1791, Darejan persuaded her husband to overturn the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture</b> in favor of fraternal inheritance, mandating in his will that after his death, his eldest son George would become king, but that after George's death, the throne would pass to the next surviving son of Heraclius, rather than to George's offspring. The surviving sons of Heraclius and Darejan—Iulon, Vakhtang, Mirian, Alexander, and Parnaoz—thus, emerged in the line of succession. After Heraclius's death in 1798, the now King George XII, reneged on the will of the late king, declaring it invalid on account of it being forced upon his father. This occasioned a further breakdown in already strained relations between George XII and Darejan and his half-brothers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the {{collateral}} line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture.

John of Gaunt's eldest daughter having married into the Portuguese House of Aviz, one of his descendants was the Infanta of Spain, Isabella Clara Eugenia. The legitimacy of Isabella's claim was seriously put forward, on the Catholic side of the argument. A reason given for Essex's Rebellion was that the Infanta's claim had gained traction with Elizabeth and her counsellors.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{the current}} 1810 Act of Succession (Successionsordningen, SO) is a treaty {{between the old}} Riksdag of the Estates and the House of Bernadotte {{regulating}} the right to accede to the Swedish throne. In 1980, the old <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> agnatic <b>primogeniture,</b> which meant that the throne was inherited by the eldest male child of the preceding monarch, {{was replaced by the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> absolute <b>primogeniture.</b> This meant that the throne will be inherited by the eldest child without regard to sex. Thereby Princess Victoria, the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, was created heiress apparent to the Swedish throne over her younger brother, until then Crown Prince Carl Philip.|$|R

Paul's first act as Emperor was to inquire about and, if possible, destroy her testament, as he feared it would exclude him from succession and leave the throne to Alexander.

50|$|Frederick IX had, however, fathered three {{daughter}}s. In 1953, the Danish Act of Succession was {{amended to}} follow the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> male-preference <b>primogeniture.</b> The new law made Frederick IX's thirteen-year-old daughter Margrethe the new heir presumptive, placing her and her two sisters before Knud and his family {{in the line of}} succession.|$|R
25|$|The Peerage, still, {{was not an}} {{hereditary}} body. Kings did {{not consider}} themselves, having once summoned an individual, bound to summon the same individual, much less his heirs, to future Parliaments. Thus, writs were issued at the whim of the King. Over time, however, the arbitrary power of the Crown was fettered by the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> hereditary right. At first, the writ of summons {{was regarded as a}} burden and interference, but later, when Parliament's power increased, it was seen as a sign of royal favour. Since the Crown was itself an hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Peerage had evolved its hereditary characteristics. Since under Norman customs, estates devolved under the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture,</b> seats in Parliament did so as well.|$|R

Based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture</b> practiced by the Georgian royal family, he can be considered heir presumptive to Nugzar Bagration-Gruzinsky, a scion of Ilia's elder brother Bagrat, who claims headship of the Royal House of Georgia and has no son.|$|E

Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture.</b> However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry.

50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture</b> also {{violated}} {{the right of}} women to human dignity, guaranteed by section 10 of the Constitution, because it implied that women were not fit or competent to own and administer property. Its effect was also to subject these women to a status of perpetual minority, placing them automatically {{under the control of}} male heirs, by virtue simply of their sex and gender. Their dignity was further affronted by the fact that, as women, they were also excluded from intestate succession and denied the right to be holders of and to control property.|$|E
50|$|The court decided that, to {{the extent}} that the primogeniture rule {{prevented}} all female children from inheriting, and significantly curtailed the inheritance rights of male extra-marital children, it discriminated against them, too. These were particularly vulnerable groups in South African society, which correctly placed much store in the well-being and protection of children who were ordinarily not in a position to protect themselves. In denying female and extra-marital children the ability and the opportunity to inherit from their deceased fathers, the application of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>primogeniture</b> was also in violation of section 9(3) of the Constitution.|$|E
