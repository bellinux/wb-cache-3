5|$|In 1760, {{one year}} after Voltaire {{published}} Candide, a sequel was published with the name Candide, ou l'optimisme, seconde <b>partie.</b> This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. Part II has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of Candide, but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of Candide or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de <b>partie</b> heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E

25|$|All of Saussure's {{observations}} and experiments from seven Alpine journeys were summed up {{and published in}} four quarto volumes, under the general title of Voyages dans les Alpes (1779 – 1796 (There was an octavo issue in eight volumes, issued from 1780 to 1796).

25|$|A {{longer and}} {{somewhat}} different {{draft of this}} play was begun in English, and is dated December 1956. This being the case it was conceived whilst Beckett was putting the final touches to Fin de <b>partie</b> (which took him from 1954 till 1957 to complete) but before he began its translation into English. The original title, The Beggar and the Cripple has been scored out and replaced with The Gloaming.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{translated}} all of {{his works}} into English himself, {{with the exception of}} Molloy, for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of Waiting for Godot opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including Fin de <b>partie</b> (Endgame) (1957), Krapp's Last Tape (1958, written in English), Happy Days (1961, also written in English), and Play (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with Jorge Luis Borges.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to France, Cartier-Bresson applied for a job with renowned French film director Jean Renoir. He acted in Renoir's 1936 film <b>Partie</b> de campagne and in the 1939 La Règle du jeu, for which he played a butler and served as second assistant. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand {{how it felt to}} be {{on the other side of}} the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish civil war, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti-fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services.|$|E
25|$|Proposals were {{requested}} of Charles de Wailly and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In {{spite of}} the negative opinions given by several of her circle, notably Gabriel, Mme du Barry decided to retain the project of Ledoux, then {{at the beginning of}} his career. The design was completed in 1770 and construction was carried out in 1771. The inauguration took place on 2 September 1771 in the presence of the King. A play by Charles Collé was performed, La <b>partie</b> de chasse de Henri IV, and dinner was served with music (the musicians complained about the exiguity of the platforms of the dining room, now shut off by mirrors) followed by a display of fireworks.|$|E

500|$|From 1669 to 1674 Bruce {{sat in the}} Scottish Parliament as shire {{commissioner}} for Fife, and from 1681 to 1682 as a shire {{commissioner for}} Kinross. From April 1685 to May 1686 he reached {{the peak of his}} political career, {{as a member of the}} Privy Council of Scotland. But, in 1674, he became embroiled in factional rivalry between his patron Lauderdale, and his rivals the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Tweeddale. His actions, which apparently included passing information to Hamilton, invoked the fury of the Duchess of Lauderdale, who tried to persuade her husband to deprive Bruce of his offices. Bruce survived, although his relationship with his patron was damaged. Lauderdale described him as [...] "the bitterest factionalist <b>partie</b> man of his quality in all Scotland". This breakdown resulted in Bruce's eventual dismissal as Surveyor General of the King's Works, on the false pretext that Holyroodhouse was finished.|$|E

2500|$|Pachelbel's other {{chamber music}} {{includes}} an aria and variations (Aria con variazioni in A major) and four standalone suites scored for a string quartet or a typical French five-part string ensemble with 2 violins, 2 violas and a violone (the latter reinforces the basso continuo). Of these, the five-part suite in G major (<b>Partie</b> a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement {{begins with a}} theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (<b>Partie</b> a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (<b>Partie</b> a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. The three pieces mentioned all end with a Finale movement. Interestingly, <b>Partie</b> a 4 in G major features no figuration for the lower part, which means {{that it was not}} a basso continuo and that, as Jean M. Perreault writes, [...] "this work may well count as the first true string quartet, at least within the Germanophone domain." ...|$|E
