5|$|Before its September 2011 release, Drive {{was shown}} {{at a number}} of film festivals, {{including}} the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was praised and received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film received widespread praise, with critics highlighting Refn's direction, performances by the ensemble cast, visuals and action sequences, and the film score composed by Cliff Martinez. However, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the film's box office success. Several critics listed Drive {{as one of the best}} films of 2011; it received various accolades, including Best Sound Editing nomination at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The AKC {{standard}} {{has hardly}} been altered {{from the original}} of 1896, the principal change being that the colours, 'black and tan', 'red and tan', and 'tawny', have been renamed as 'black and tan', 'liver and tan', and 'red', but the British KC has made considerable changes. Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding {{to the view that}} the requirements of some breed standards were <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye shape and the loose skin, the most recent revision being 2008-9.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{announced}} on 27 Novemberone day after Turnbull survived Kevin Andrews' spill motionthat he would challenge Turnbull for the leadership. Abbott committed to withdrawing his candidacy if Joe Hockey was to challenge. Abbott confirmed {{his opposition to}} the ETS legislation, questioning why Australia would legislate for a <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> economic measure before other countries had committed to do the same. A Newspoll released on 30 November placed Hockey at 33%, Turnbull at 30% and Abbott at 19%, when voters were asked who would be the [...] "best person to lead" [...] the Liberal Party. Speculation flourished that Hockey would challenge Turnbull, and Hockey consulted senior party dignitaries such as Howard and Costello about whether he should run.|$|E

2500|$|After this {{somewhat}} strained but greatly productive discussion concerning arms, {{the negotiations}} between the two delegations became more general, with Ford admitting the challenge posed by economic difficulties in the United States and Brezhnev explaining that some members of his Politburo did not think d√©tente was a prudent strategy, whom he knew would be highly critical of him if he made too many concessions to the Americans. Then, somewhat to Ford's surprise, Brezhnev began talking in considerable detail about the United States Congress, which the Soviets {{had come to see}} as <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to their ability to negotiate with American presidents.

2500|$|A rift {{develops}} and widens between Dan and Laura as they firmly {{disagree on}} the question of an implant. Dan's hearing parents favor the surgery because it would help them communicate better with their grandson, as they never learned much sign language, living far away. Laura's deaf parents are strongly opposed, especially her father, a fierce advocate of Deaf Pride and an author on the subject. Soon, the larger issues of Deaf Pride and the overall ethics of cochlear implants become the focus of the argument, as implants are viewed to have a <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> effect on Deaf culture. Laura's father, Max, says, [...] "The majority always thinks each minority wants to be like them", as he doesn't consider deafness to be a disability. Dan, who feels his father-in-law never accepted him, sees this attitude as deaf prejudice against him and all hearing people, when all Dan wants is to give his son a fuller life and a better future.|$|E

5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might <b>potentially</b> be <b>detrimental</b> to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|R
5000|$|The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) {{has emerged}} as a robust model for {{understanding}} the individual differences in humor styles. Humor can be used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationship with others. Humor can be relatively benevolent or <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> (either to the self or others). [...] The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Some styles of humor promote health and well-being, while other styles can be <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to mental and physical health.|$|E

We review 174 case reports and series on nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) ocular infections and discuss etiology, microbiology, risk factors, diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of these infections. History of interventions, trauma, foreign bodies, implants, contact lenses, and steroids are linked to NTM ocular infections. Steroid use may prolong the duration of the infection and cause poorer visual outcomes. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment with multiple antibiotics are necessary to achieve the best visual outcome...|$|R

Alexander von Humboldt inspired a generation of scientists, such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, to observe and study tropical ecosystems. More recently, the mid- 20 th century saw Theodosius Dobzhansky and Daniel Janzen lay the foundations for studying adaptation to tropical climates. Now in the 21 st century, {{we are beginning to}} realize the threats posed by current and future climate change to tropical populations which, despite relatively low levels of projected warming for low-latitude regions, face <b>potentially</b> significant <b>detrimental</b> impacts.

40|$|The {{independent}} {{roles of}} each childhood maltreatment type on child abuse potential in adults have been insufficiently explored and are inconsistent, with dissociation {{as one of}} the possible suggested mediators of intergenerational child abuse. We investigated these effects among 164 non-clinical adult parents, who filled in general questionnaires: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) and Dissociative Experience Scale (DES). Among all maltreatment types (emotional, physical and sexual abuse, emotional and physical neglect), emotional abuse was the only independent predictor in the regression model of child abuse potential. The relationship between emotional abuse history and child abuse potential was partially mediated by dissociation. The findings could speak in favor of the <b>potentially</b> unique <b>detrimental</b> role of emotional abuse in intergenerational maltreatment, with dissociation {{as one of the}} possible mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing cost of high {{precision}} scroll compressor parts remains a dominating {{factor in determining}} the overall production cost. Traditionally, scroll compressors are made of metallic parts which require high tolerances to avoid leakage. Precision {{is even more important}} when the compressor is designed for oil-free operation and metal to metal contact can <b>potentially</b> be <b>detrimental</b> to the overall performance. With implementation of non-metallic compressor parts such as plastics, various avenues such as injection molding can be taken to reduce production cost. In addition, various polymer blends can be chosen to alleviate the danger of contact through the use of self-lubricating materials. In the present study, a new compressor concept has been designed and built from both plastic and metallic materials. Performance tests have been conducted on the compressor concept and comparison between plastic and metallic compressor performance have been made...|$|R

Enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) has been widely observed in wastewater treatment processes. This article reviews the current knowledge on the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals by AOB. The relationship between the pharmaceuticals removal and nitrification process was revealed. The important role of AOB-induced cometabolism on the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals as well as their transformation products and pathways was elucidated. Kinetics and mathematical models describing the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals by AOB were also reviewed. The results highlighted the high degradation capabilities of AOB toward some refractory pharmaceuticals, with their degradations being clearly related to the nitrification rate and their transformation products being identified, which may exhibit similar or higher ecotoxicological impacts compared to the parent compound...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} acorn (Quercus crispula) {{abundance}} {{on the population}} dynamics of three rodent species (Apodemus speciosus, A. argenteus, and Clethrionomys rufocanus) were analyzed using time series data (1992 ‚Äì 2006). The data were obtained in a forest in northern Hokkaido, Japan, by live trapping rodents and directly counting acorns on the ground. Apodemus speciosus generally increased in abundance following acorn masting. However, the clear effect of acorn abundance was not detected for the other two rodent species. Acorns of Q. crispula contain tannins, which <b>potentially</b> have <b>detrimental</b> effects on herbivores. Apodemus speciosus may reduce {{the damage caused by}} acorn tannins with tannin-binding salivary proteins and tannaseproducing bacteria, whereas such physiological tolerance to tannins is not known in the other two rodent species.

White adipose tissue, {{far from being}} a mere energy depot, is a dynamic tissue actively implicated in metabolic reactions, and in fact secretes several hormones called adipokines and inflammatory factors that may in turn promote bone resorption. More specifically, Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) may <b>potentially</b> prove <b>detrimental.</b> It is widely acknowledged that obesity is positively associated to many chronic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes, conditions that could themselves affect bone health.
