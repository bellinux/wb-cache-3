50|$|After {{entering}} the trade, the trader needs {{to place a}} <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> order to close the position with minimal loss if the trade goes wrong. The <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> order will also serve to prevent losses {{in the event of}} a disastrously timed internet connection loss for online traders.|$|E
50|$|A {{price action}} trader will trade this pattern, e.g. a double bottom, {{by placing a}} buy stop order 1 tick above the bar that created the second 'bottom'. If the order is filled, then the trader sets a <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> order 1 tick below the same bar.|$|E
50|$|The simple entry {{technique}} involves placing the entry order 1 tick above the H or 1 tick below the L {{and waiting for}} it to be executed as the next bar develops. If so, this is the entry bar, and the H or L was the signal bar, and the <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> is placed 1 tick under an H or 1 tick above an L.|$|E
50|$|If {{the price}} action traders have other {{reasons to be}} bearish in {{addition}} to this action, they will be waiting for this situation and will take the opportunity to make money going short where the trapped bulls have their <b>protective</b> <b>stops</b> positioned. If the reversal in the outside bar was quick, then many bearish traders will be as surprised as the bulls and the result will provide extra impetus to the market as they all seek to sell after the outside bar has closed. The same sort of situation also holds true in reverse for retracements of bear trends.|$|R
5000|$|The pattern {{consists}} of a measurable period of rest and volatility contraction in the market, followed by a relatively brief price move that encourages unsuspecting traders and investors to adopt a false assumption regarding the likely future direction of price. The pattern, once formed, yields {{its own set of}} trading parameters for the time and price of market entry, the dollar risk amount (i.e., where to place <b>protective</b> <b>stops),</b> and the expected profit target. The pattern is not meant as a stand alone [...] "system" [...] for market speculation, but rather as an ancillary technique to traditional technical and fundamental market analysis methods.|$|R
50|$|Most works {{exhibited}} are paintings, {{although some}} computer graphics and three-dimensional art are included. The {{shock and vibration}} potential of train travel require that sculptures and other three-dimensional works, {{especially if they are}} at all fragile, be transported in <b>protective</b> cases between <b>stops,</b> which increases the setup time enough that an all-sculpture exhibition would be prohibitive.|$|R
50|$|A typical setup {{using the}} ii pattern is {{outlined}} by Brooks. An ii after a sustained trend that {{has suffered a}} trend line break is likely to signal a strong reversal if the market breaks out against the trend. The small inside bars are attributed to the buying and the selling pressure equalling out. The entry stop order would be placed one tick on the countertrend side of the first bar of the ii and the <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> would be placed one tick beyond the first bar on the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|Price action traders who {{are unsure}} of market {{direction}} but sure of further movement - an opinion gleaned from other price action - would place an entry to buy above an ii or an iii and simultaneously an entry to sell below it, and {{would look for}} the market {{to break out of}} the price range of the pattern. Whichever order is executed, the other order then becomes the <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> order that would get the trader out of the trade with a small loss if the market doesn't act as predicted.|$|E
5000|$|Since many traders place <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> {{orders to}} exit from {{positions}} that go wrong, all the stop orders placed by trapped traders {{will provide the}} orders that boost {{the market in the}} direction that the more patient traders bet on. The phrase [...] "the stops were run" [...] refers to the execution of these stop orders. Since 2009, {{the use of the term}} “trapped traders” has grown in popularity and is now a generic term used by price actions traders and applied in different markets - stocks, futures, forex, commodities, etc. All trapped trader strategies are essentially variations of Brooks pioneering work.|$|E

5000|$|... "Five tick failed breakouts" [...] are a {{phenomenon}} {{that is a great}} example of price action trading. Five tick failed breakouts are characteristic of the stock index futures markets. Many speculators trade for a profit of just four ticks, a trade which requires the market to move 6 ticks in the trader's direction for the entry and exit orders to be filled. These traders will place <b>protective</b> <b>stop</b> orders to exit on failure {{at the opposite end of}} the breakout bar. So if the market breaks out by five ticks and does not hit their profit targets, then the price action trader will see this as a five tick failed breakout and will enter in the opposite direction at the opposite end of the breakout bar to take advantage of the stop orders from the losing traders' exit orders.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years the need for more {{flexibility}} in industrial production has implied a growing attention towards scenarios where humans work directly in touch with robots. In order to allow safe human-robot interaction, a methodology to evaluate the severity of an impact between a human worker and an industrial robot, based on related work on injury knowledge in human-robot contacts and relying on information coming from different exteroceptive sensors, has been developed in this paper. On the basis of this severity evaluation, the robot controller enforces a suitable safety-oriented strategy, ranging from on-path speed reduction to task-consistent evasive motion and <b>protective</b> <b>stop.</b> The safety evaluation methodology has been implemented in a dedicated software component, integrated with a video surveillance system and with the real time robot controller to obtain a complete HW/SW architecture named “Safety Controller”.

2500|$|Rhyner {{and several}} Special Forces members were wounded {{throughout}} the course of the battle. Rhyner was shot twice in the chest and once in the leg, although his <b>protective</b> vest <b>stopped</b> the two bullets to his chest from causing a mortal injury. Despite being wounded within the first fifteen minutes of the battle, Rhyner continued to direct close air support and airstrikes until the assault force was evacuated seven hours later. 50 of the airstrikes he called in were within 200m of friendly positions; the term [...] "danger close" [...] is applied when referring to airstrikes within 600m. He was credited with saving the entire 100-man team from being overrun twice. According to the Air Force Cross citation, during the battle Rhyner directed close air support and airstrikes totalling 4,570 cannon rounds, nine Hellfire missiles, 162 rockets, a dozen 500-pound bombs, and one 2,000-pound bomb. As a result of the same battle, ten U.S. Army soldiers, nine Special Forces and one Combat Cameraman received the Silver Star, the greatest number of Silver Stars awarded for a single battle since the Vietnam War.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} crisis in Colombia {{during the period of}} 1928 through 1933 was a devastating result of the previous years of prosperity based on high amounts of international loans and credits, high prices in the exporting coffee and a confident country that generated investment and cash flow. The same way that Colombia prospered thanks to the U.S.A., it went down parallel to it in their time of crisis. The New York stock market collapsed and the confidence within the country was low and <b>protective,</b> the investment <b>stopped,</b> as well as the loans and Colombia was directly affected by that situation. There was a constant decrease in the exporting potential product of Colombia; coffee, as well as a cut in the international loans and investment. Eventually the crisis in the U.S.A. generated within Colombia a cut in urban employment, diminished internal market and among other problematic social and economic situations.|$|R

40|$|Background: The SARS {{outbreak}} in 2003 {{has spawned a}} major controversy concerning protective performance facemasks for healthcare workers. This study reports a study on in-vivo protective performance of surgical masks and N 95 respirators. Methods: Typical surgical masks and N 95 respirators used in Hong Kong hospitals were tested in comparison with those treated with nano-functional materials (called nano-masks) on various physical properties and in-vivo wear filtration efficiency, as well as usability test in hospitals for surgical masks. Results: Tests on physical properties showed that N 95 respirators had significantly lower air permeability and water vapor permeability than surgical masks. The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N 95 respirators filtered out 97 % of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95 % of KCl solution. Nano-masks show stronger water repellency and antibacterial activities, but no difference in usability, comparing with normal N 95 and surgical masks. Conclusions: Surgical masks can provide in-vivo filtration protection of 95 % filtration efficiency. N 95 respirators provide higher in-vivo filtration efficiency of 97 % with significant reduction of air permeability and water vapor permeability. Compared to normal surgical masks/respirators, the nano-masks can provide additional <b>protective</b> functions in <b>stopping</b> capillary diffusion and antibacterial activities.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus and its progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome {{has become one of}} the most prominent global health issues. As the number of infected persons continues to grow, it is increasingly important to develop a <b>protective</b> vaccine to <b>stop</b> HIV transmission, and a cure for those already infected. Although current combination antiretroviral therapy can help patients maintain undetectable levels of the virus throughout their bodies, once the treatment is stopped, the virus will rebound. In this project, the effects of a vaccine therapy that targets the protease cleavage sites (PCS) of the HIV protease were evaluated in 16 Cynomolgus macaques. Preliminary results of the study show that in the vaccine group (n= 11), a disruption to one or more of the HIV protease cleavage sites leads to a better maintenance of CD 4 + T cells versus that in the control group (n= 5). Furthermore, a correlation between the percentage of PCS mutations and viral load was also observed. Upon closer analysis, it was determined that the most common sites of mutation occur at PCS 2 and PCS 12. To assess the impact of these PCS mutations on viral fitness, we used site directed mutagenesis to introduce single amino acid mutations into a fully infectious SIV clone (SIVmac 239). Ongoing studies include producing virus stocks of the SIVmac 239 mutants (with multiple PCS mutations) and evaluating the viral fitness of the SIVmac 239 clones in cell lines using growth competition assays. The data from this study and future studies will help provide information in the areas of vaccine and therapy development for HIV...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{neutropenia}} due to high-dose chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation {{are at risk}} of serious infections and are frequently nursed in strict protective isolation. This is a costly procedure and results in a psychological burden for the patient and its significance has been debated for a long time. The introduction of very potent systemic antibiotics, antibiotic prophylaxis, haematopoietic growth factors and peripheral stem cell transplantation might have decreased the need for it. We performed a systematic literature review and conducted a medical/nursing guideline study. In the literature we searched especially for prospective randomised studies. Only six were found, these were prospective randomised studies and contradicted each other on the usefulness of protective isolation. In an initiative aimed at promoting evidence-based care, we conducted a combined medical and nursing guideline study consisting of three parts: (1) inventory of (inter) national guidelines; (2) analysis of potential sources of infection; and (3) follow-up study post-implementation of new guidelines. RESULTS: (1) The practices in different centres in Europe appeared to vary widely. (2) Micro-organisms spread easily, especially if hands are not adequately dried. Isolation does not prevent this. Based on these findings we decided to <b>stop</b> <b>protective</b> isolation. This change of policy was combined with a campaign for optimal hygiene and introduction of hand alcohol. (3) We monitored the incidence of febrile neutropenia, infections and use of systemic antibiotics and antifungals in a 3 -year period without protective isolation and compared this with the findings in the preceding 3 years with isolation. No significant differences in infections and mortality were found. We concluded that abandoning protective isolation combined with increased hygienic measures in nursing of patients with severe neutropenia does not increase the risk of infections, but improves the quality of care and patient satisfaction and reduces cost...|$|R
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) {{is regarded}} as one of the bottlenecks of successful clinical treatment for numerous chemotherapeutic agents. Multiple key regulators are alleged to be responsible for MDR and making the treatment regimens ineffective. In this review, we discuss MDR in relation to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and its down-regulation by natural bioactive molecules. P-gp, a unique ATP-dependent membrane transport protein, is one of those key regulators which are present in the lining of the colon, endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB), bile duct, adrenal gland, kidney tubules, small intestine, pancreatic ducts and in many other tissues like heart, lungs, spleen, skeletal muscles, etc. Due to its diverse tissue distribution, P-gp is a novel <b>protective</b> barrier to <b>stop</b> the intake of xenobiotics into the human body. Over-expression of P-gp leads to decreased intracellular accretion of many chemotherapeutic agents thus assisting in the development of MDR. Eventually, the effectiveness of these drugs is decreased. P-gp inhibitors act by altering intracellular ATP levels which are the source of energy and/or by affecting membrane contours to increase permeability. However, the use of synthetic inhibitors is known to cause serious toxicities. For this reason, the search for more potent and less toxic P-gp inhibitors of natural origin is underway. The present review aims to recapitulate the research findings on bioactive constituents of natural origin with P-gp inhibition characteristics. Natural bioactive constituents with P-gp modulating effects offer great potential for semi-synthetic modification to produce new scaffolds which could serve as valuable investigative tools to recognize the function of complex ABC transporters apart from evading the systemic toxicities shown by synthetic counterparts. Despite the many published scientific findings encompassing P-gp inhibitors, however, this article stand alones because it provides a vivid picture to the readers pertaining to Pgp inhibitors obtained from natural sources coupled with their mode of action and structures. It provides first-hand information to the scientists working in the field of drug discovery to further synthesise and discover new P-gp inhibitors with less toxicity and more efficacies...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{countries}} {{currently have}} nuclear weapons and of these only three have acquired {{them in the past}} 40 years. The primary reason for this has been the establishment of a powerful nuclear non-proliferation regime and its associated norms. The powerful influence of both the regime and the resulting norms on state behaviour is unquestionable. However a limited amount of state proliferation continues and some states’ behaviour suggests that they either reject, or believe that they are outside of the influence of the regime and its norms. My study is looking at the problem of non-conformity to the non-proliferation norm to see why it occurs. The issue is specifically a nuclear one however non-conformity to norms has wider implications in the study of international relations (IR). Regimes and norms clearly do not exist in a vacuum but operate within an international social environment. This nuclear issue remains a central consideration for state foreign policy and hence has justified extensive examination in the field of IR. The intellectually and ethically complex issues that surround access to this technology were acknowledged from its devastating baptism in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. International regulation was seen as the most appropriate form of control of nuclear weapons. This was in part due to the potential consequence of the misuse and the impact of accidents transcending national boundaries. This ultimate destructive capability has only been {{in the hands of a}} few states and the dissemination and control of this capability has been contentious from the day it was first used. Initially its power came from its potential to completely dominate militarily. As soon as the second country gained the same capability it became a lot more complicated. The destructive capability of nuclear weapons is such that any future war that saw their use could result in the annihilation of the human species. The Cold War and its extreme vertical nuclear proliferation actualised this fear. Nuclear technologies dual purpose functionality, of both peaceful power generation and the creation of a military nuclear capability make for a complex situation. There is an obvious power imbalance between the nuclear haves and have-nots and a self <b>protective</b> desire to <b>stop</b> or at least limit the number of countries attempting to join the ‘nuclear club’. Both realism and neo-liberal institutionalism are able to explain, in part, conformity and non conformity to regimes and their associated norms within today’s social environment. In this study I will use a social constructivist approach, which is based on the outcomes of persuasion, identification and social conformity, to see if it can add to the current explanations of state nuclear proliferation...|$|R
