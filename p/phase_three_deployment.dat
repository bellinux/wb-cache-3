40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{systems are}} {{becoming}} popular in congested {{cities around the}} world. Since this mode of transportation is still evolving, {{there is a lack}} of clear definition of what constitutes a BRT system. This paper reviews the BRT systems around the world and characterizes their infrastructure and operational features. The most common features found are those that lead to travel time reduction or ridership attraction relative to regular bus services. However, not all the features must be implemented for a BRT system to be successful. Based on the features reviewed, this research recommends three sets of features that correspond to <b>three</b> <b>phases</b> of <b>deployment</b> in U. S. cities, depending on the project budget, time frame, users, and traffic and corridor characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The SoLid {{experiment}} aims {{to resolve}} the reactor neutrino anomaly by searching for electron-to-sterile anti-neutrino oscillations. The search will be performed between 5. 5 and 10 m from the highly enriched uranium core of the BR 2 reactor at SCK-CEN. The experiment utilises a novel approach to anti-neutrino detection based on a highly segmented, composite scintillator detector design. High experimental sensitivity can be achieved {{using a combination of}} high neutron-gamma discrimination using 6 LiF:ZnS(Ag) and precise localisation of the inverse beta decay products. This compact detector system requires limited passive shielding as it relies on spacial topology to determine the different classes of backgrounds. The first full scale, 288 kg, detector module was deployed at the BR 2 reactor in November 2014. A <b>phased</b> <b>three</b> tonne experimental <b>deployment</b> will begin {{in the second half of}} 2016, allowing a precise search for oscillations that will resolve the reactor anomaly using a three tonne detector running for three years. In this talk the novel detector design is explained and initial detector performance results from the module level deployment are presented along with an estimation of the physics reach of the next phase.

40|$|The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is an {{extension}} of the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is used to detect radio emission from extensive air showers in the 30 - 80 MHz frequency band. A focus of interest is the dependence of the radio emission on shower parameters such as the energy and the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum. After <b>three</b> <b>phases</b> of <b>deployment,</b> AERA now consists of 153 autonomous radio stations with different spacings, covering an area of about 17 km 2. The size, station spacings, and geographic location at the same site or near other Auger extensions, are all targeted at cosmic ray energies above 10 [sup] 17 eV. The array allows us to explore different technical schemes to measure the radio emission as well as to cross calibrate our measurements with the established baseline detectors of the Auger Observatory. We present the most recent technological developments and selected experimental results obtained with AERA...|$|R

40|$|The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is an {{extension}} of the Pierre Auger Cosmic-Ray Observatory. It is used to detect radio emission from extensive air showers with energies beyond $ 10 ^{ 17 }~$eV in the $ 30 - 80 ~$MHz frequency band. After <b>three</b> <b>phases</b> of <b>deployment,</b> AERA now consists of more than 150 autonomous radio stations with different spacings, covering an area of about $ 17 ~$km$^ 2 $. It is located at the same site as other Auger low-energy detector extensions enabling combinations with various other measurement techniques. The radio array allows different technical schemes to be explored as well as cross-calibration of our measurements with the established baseline detectors of the Auger Observatory. We report on the most recent technological developments and give an overview of the experimental results obtained with AERA. In particular, we will present the measurement of the radiation energy, i. e., the amount of energy that is emitted by the air shower in the form of radio emission, and its dependence on the cosmic-ray energy by comparing with the measurement of the the well-calibrated Auger surface detector. Furthermore, we outline the relevance of this result for the absolute calibration of the energy scale of cosmic-ray observatories.

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} are often desired to last many {{times longer than}} the active lifetime of individual sensors. This is usually achieved by putting sensors to sleep {{for most of their}} lifetime. On the other hand, event monitoring applications require guaranteed k-coverage of the protected region at all times. As a result, determining the appropriate number of sensors to deploy that achieves both goals simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider <b>three</b> kinds of <b>deployments</b> for a sensor network on a unit square—a √ n × √ n grid, random uniform (for all n points), and Poisson (with density n). In all <b>three</b> <b>deployments,</b> each sensor is active with probability p, independently from the others. Then, we claim that the critical value of the function npπr 2 / log(np) is 1 for the event of k-coverage of every point. We also provide an upper bound on the window of this phase transition.
