40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of two biochars (<b>pyrolysed</b> <b>wood</b> chips and garden clippings) on phosphorus (P) availability in a heavy-metal contaminated soil poor in phosphorus. Short-term 14 -days incubation experiments were conducted to study how applications of biochars at different rates (1 and 5 %) in combination with (1 : 1) and without dried sewage sludge from a municipal {{waste water treatment plant}} (WWTP) affected the content of soil extractable P. For P-availability analyses deionized water, calcium acetate lactate (CAL), Mehlich 3 and Olsen extraction protocols were applied. In addition, the content of total and mobile forms of potentially toxic heavy metals (PTHM) was studied. Application of both biochars caused a significant decrease of PTHM available forms in sewage sludge amended soil samples. The concentration of total and available P increased with higher biochar and sewage sludge application rates...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{delivery}} in biomaterials requires {{consideration of the}} pore network to store and deliver greater concentrations {{over an extended period}} of time. The porous structure in wood is used for delivery of water and therefore presents a possible pore architecture for storing fluids. The goal was to determine the pore characteristics of dried and <b>pyrolysed</b> <b>wood</b> and then investigate the ability to uptake water into the porous network. Balsa (Ochroma Pyramidale Urb) and oak (American: Quercus Alba and European: Quercus Robus) were selected based on the large pore size (100 – 200 μm). The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the pore volume determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The open and closed porosity was determined by the Archimedes method. Wood was pyrolyzed in a non-oxiding atmosphere between 800 and 1400 oC, the pore structure evaluated and the water uptake determined. Oak provides an open porosity 2. 8 times greater than balsa. Pyrolysis of the wood open the pits, connecting vertically oriented tracheids with the other channel systems in wood (vessels and rays) for greater pore interconnectivity. The uptake of water, as determined by a liquid permeability test shows an initial linear uptake of 60 % of the total water capacity, followed by a slower uptake of the remaining volume. This study shows that American oak has a larger open porosity and that pore connectivity can be improved by pyrolysis at 800 oC. Such a bimodal interconnected pore structure may find use for drug {{delivery in}} biomaterials applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbon {{in dense}} {{as well as}} porous solid form is used {{in a variety of}} applications. Activated porous carbons are made through {{pyrolysis}} and activation of carbonaceous natural as well as synthetic precursors. <b>Pyrolysed</b> <b>woods</b> replicate the structure of original wood but as such possess very low surface areas and poor adsorption capacities. On activation, these exhibit increased adsorption volumes of 05 – 08 cm 3 =gm and surface areas of 700 – 1800 m 2 =gm depending on activation conditions, whether physical or chemical. Former carbons possess mixed pore size distribution while chemically activated carbons predominantly possess micropores. Thus, these carbons can be used for adsorption of wide distributions of molecules from gas to liquid. The molecular adsorption within the pores is due to single layer or multilayer molecule deposition at the pore walls and hence results in different types of adsorption isotherm. On the other hand, activated carbon fibres with con-trolled microporous structure and surface area in the range of 2500 m 2 =gm can be developed by controlled pyrolysis and physical activation of amorphous carbon fibres. Active carbon fibres with unmatchable pore structure and surface character-istics are present and futuristic porous materials for a number of applications from pollution control to energy storage...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an upsurge of {{interest}} in using high density and low volatile matter charcoal to replace coke and coal {{in the manufacture of}} aluminium and steel due to its potential to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from the production process. ‘White’ charcoal is envisaged as a potential candidate for this application. It is synthesized by <b>pyrolysing</b> <b>wood</b> at low temperature (∼ 240 °C) for 120 hours, and then raising the kiln temperature to ∼ 1000 °C {{towards the end of the}} carbonization process. The charcoal is then withdrawn and smothered with a moistened mixture of earth, sand and ash. However, to date, little is known about the structure of this form of charcoal, which is essential before this material can be widely applied in extractive metallurgy. Characterization of white charcoal with nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high fixed carbon content (> 95 wt%) with ∼ 82 at. % of the carbon present in the form of condensed aromatic rings. Scanning electron microscope analysis depicts a porous microstructure with pores ∼ 100 μm in diameter aligned across the surface and a high density of macropores < 10 μm in diameter scattered across the surface. Transmission electron microscope and x-ray diffraction analysis of white charcoal showed a mainly amorphous carbon structure with localized regions of crystalline graphite and calcites. The suitability of white charcoal as a replacement for coke is also discussed...|$|R

Isotopic changes on charring were small (≤ 0. 3 ‰). In these respects, the synthesised chars were similar to chars produced at low temperature (< 500 °C) in natural fires and thus may prove to be appropriate materials for calibrating BC quantification methods.

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{efficient}} and promising technique for small-scale {{combined heat and power}} production {{has been identified}} and investigated by the building of a simulation model in Matlab/Simulink. A Danish 2 -stage gasifier called Viking has been used as the starting point in the study, due to its low tar content and effective way of using heat in the engine’s exhaust gases to dry and <b>pyrolyse</b> the <b>wood</b> chips. This preheating technique increases the efficiency of the gasifier from about 75 % to over 90 %. In this study, both an Otto engine and a more advanced HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) engine, which is a mixture of the Otto and Diesel engine, was simulated. The simulations showed that {{it would be possible to}} reach an efficiency of the engine of over 40 %, which gives an electric effi-ciency of the system near 40 %, based on the lower heating value.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{is focused}} on changes of {{mechanical}} properties in <b>pyrolysed</b> spruce <b>wood</b> {{as a function of}} temperature up to 2400 °C. Nanoindentation tests are used for the determination of mechanical properties at the scale of single wood cell walls. Hardness, indentation modulus and elasto-plastic/brittle behaviour of the carbonaceous residues are derived as function of pyrolysis temperature. Hardness values increase continuously by more than one order of magnitude to 4. 5 GPa at 700 °C. The indentation modulus shows complex changes with a minimum of 5 GPa around 400 °C, and a maximum of 40 GPa around 1000 °C. The deformation induced by the indenter is largely (visco-) plastic in native wood, but it is almost purely elastic in the carbonaceous residue with particular low values of the indentation ductility index around 700 °C. A low density, strongly cross-linked carbon structure may explain the mechanical behaviour at these intermediate temperatures. A final decrease of the modulus and a slight recovery of ductility for temperatures above 2000 °C can be attributed to a continuous structural transition of the material towards graphite-like stacking of carbon sheets and to preferred carbon orientation along the wood cell axis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{number of}} waste {{disposal}} sites decreases and redundant poles, piling and lumber, which constitute a {{large volume of}} material, may not be accepted at {{the limited number of}} sites in the future. CCA contaminated wood contains around 1 - 5 % of metal in form of arsenic pentoxide, hexavalent and trivalent chromium compounds and copper sulfate, which act as fungicides and insecticides throughout the life of the wood. While CCA treatment is gradually becoming a banned practice, approximately 4 million tonnes of CCA treated wood is generated in the EU per year, which is set to continue for many decades as the in-service wood is generated in end of its life. Recycling wood waste is important for the effective utilization of natural resources. The charcoal product resulting from CCA treated wood contains Cu, Cr and As. The metals appear as both agglomerates and diffused in the solid matrix. Moreover, during pyrolysis an agglomeration process takes place, which induces not only the growth of existing mineral agglomerates but also the formation of new agglomerates. The objective of the present work is the valorisation of CCA metals and charcoal from treated wood waste. The research aims at understanding and promoting experimentally, at different pyrolysis heating rates, the generation of charcoal with high specific surface area from <b>pyrolysed</b> treated <b>wood</b> waste...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to design, construct, test and operate a novel ablative pyrolysis reactor and product recovery system. Other key objectives included {{the development of an}} ablative pyrolysis reactor design methodology, mathematical modelling of the ablation process and measurement of empirical ablation rate data at 500 °C. The constructed reactor utilised a rotating blade approach to achieve particle ablation in a 258 mm internal diameter reactor. By fulfilling the key requirements of high relative motion and high contact pressure, pine wood particles of maximum size 6. 35 mm were successfully ablated. Sixteen experiments were carried out: five initial commissioning experiments were used to test the rotating blade concept and to solve char separation problems. Mass balances were obtained for the other eleven experiments with good closures. Based on ablatively <b>pyrolysed</b> dry <b>wood,</b> a maximum organic liquid yield of 65. 9 wt% was achieved with corresponding yields of 12. 4 wt% char, 11. 5 wt% water and 9. 2 wt% non-condensable gas. Reactor throughputs of 2 kg/h dry ablated wood were achieved at 600 °C. The theoretical ablative pyrolysis reactor design methodology was simplified and improved based upon empirical data derived from wood rod ablation experiments. Yields of chemicals were qualitatively similar to those of other fast pyrolysis processes. The product recovery system, comprising hot char removal, liquids collection in two ice-cooled condensers followed by gas filtration and drying, gave good mass balance closures. The most significant problem was char separation and removal from the reactor. This was solved by using a nitrogen blow line. In general, the reactor and product collection systems performed well. Future development of the reactor would involve modification of the reactor feed tube to allow the reactor residence time to be reduced and testing of the rotating blade approach with different blade angles, configurations and numbers of blades...|$|R
40|$|Lab-scale {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to gain more insight in the mechanisms responsible for the volatilisation of heavy metals during CCA wood waste pyrolysis. A step-wise approach has been followed, starting with mixtures of wood model compounds-lignin and glucose- and arsenic model compounds -arsenic pentoxide (As 2 O 5) and chromium arsenate (CrAsO 4) - and applying thereafter these insights to CCA wood waste pyrolysis. Samples were pyrolysed in an updraft fixed bed reactor at various gage pressures (0 - 5 bar) and till various temperatures (310 °C- 390 °C). After pyrolysis the samples were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to determine the amount of heavy metals still present in the solid pyrolysis residue. Moreover a ratio method was used to calculate arsenic and chromium retentions in <b>pyrolysed</b> CCA <b>wood</b> samples {{in order to reduce the}} experimental uncertainty. Elevated pressure resulted in higher metal retentions in all model compound mixtures, except for lignin/As 2 O 5 mixtures, while metal retentions are on average little affected by temperature in the range of 310 °C to 370 °C. Arsenic retention in glucose/As 2 O 5 mixtures is substantially higher compared to lignin/As 2 O 5 mixtures. Probably arsenic volatilisation in As 2 O 5 samples is mainly controlled by desorption of arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3) from the solid residue and subsequent entrainment by pyrolysis gasses. Average arsenic retention in lignin/CrAsO 4 samples is higher compared to lignin/As 2 O 5 mixtures but lower compared to glucose/As 2 O 5 mixtures while CrAsO 4 decomposition already starts at 310 °C. Average metal retention in glucose/CrAsO 4 mixtures is lower compared to glucose/As 2 O 5 mixtures and lignin/CrAsO 4 mixtures. Apparently, due to a better binding to lignin, CrAsO 4 is better stabilised on the lignin pyrolysis residue. In the case of glucose, arsenic and chromium species are poorly retained in the pyrolysis residue, leading to higher metal volatilisation in glucose samples. Metal retentions during pyrolysis of real CCA wood samples are higher at higher pressure while, between 330 °C and 370 °C, retention decreases with increasing temperature. In this temperature range average arsenic retention attains 94 % at 0 bar and 99 % at 5 bar and average chromium retention is 97 % at 0 bar and 96 % at 5 bar. Metal retention in CCA wood samples is higher compared to CrAsO 4 experiments. This is believed to be due to better fixation of CrAsO 4 to the wood substrate and due to formation of agglomerates, consisting of thermally stable compounds like calcium arsenate (Ca 5 (AsO 4) 3 (OH)). status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has {{examined}} the behaviour {{of a range of}} biomass/waste derived fuels under downdraft gasification conditions. The aim has been the identification of operating conditions leading to the complete destruction ofthe tars. A two-stage 'hot-rod' fixed-bed reactor has been developed to simulate the operating conditions in a commercial downdraft gasifier. The upper 'hot-rod' reactor simulates the pyrolysis zone of the commercial gasifier. A 1 g batch of fuel is electrically heated from ambient to 500 Ã‚Â°C at a rate representative of conditions in the upper zone of the commercial gasifier, i. e. few Ã‚Â°C/min. In the commercial device, air is injected through a throat part-way down the shaft permittJllg gasification to take place in the lower regions of the gasifier. In the laboratory experiment, the throat has been simulated by a flange with three built-in nozzles through which helium or helium-diluted air may be admitted. This flange joins the upper pyrolysis 'hot-rod' reactor to the lower, tardestruction reactor. A systematic study has been made of the factors that will destroy tar in the lower reactor; these are temperature, presence of a char bed, type of char bed, char particle size, gas residence time and addition of oxygen (as air) at the throat. In {{the first part of the}} experimental programme, the emission of tars from a range of fuels pyrolysed in the upper reactor alone has been measured. The fuels used were plastic waste, eucalyptus wood, paper sludge, pine wood and silver birch <b>wood.</b> These were <b>pyrolysed</b> under similar operating conditions, using helium as sweep gas, at atmospheric pressure.,. The reactor was operated at two different heating rates, representing the likely extremes in a commercial gasifier, i. e. 1 Ã‚Â°C/s and 10 Ã‚Â°C/s, over the temperature range 200 - 500 Ã‚Â°C, with holding times of 300 s and 900 s at peak temperature and with a helium gas velocity of 0. 1 mfs. The results indicate that the pyrolysis-derived tar, char and gas yields varied between the samples, but the trends were similar with increasing temperature; the tar yield increased with increased temperature. It was observed that silver birch wood gave the highest tar yield (at 47 % by weight of the fuel fed) in the hot-rod reactor, whilst paper sludge gave the lowest tar yield (19 %). As a result of this first phase of experiments, silver birch <b>wood,</b> <b>pyrolysed</b> to 500 Ã‚Â°C, has been chosen as the standard for the later tar destruction experiments, in the second stage. In the second phase of experiments, tar-laden gas from the upper stage was fed into the lower stage reactor, over the temperature range 700 - 1000 Ã‚Â°C. The sweep gas velocity was 2 mfs and initially helium, then a airlhelium mixture was added via three injector nozzles. Initial experiments showed that significant extents of tar destruction occur even in the absence of a packed bed in the heated, second stage reactor. Tar yield reduction from the initial value of 47 % down to 5 % has been observed at 800 Ã‚Â°C. This figure fell to 0. 7 %, when the reactor temperature was raised to 1000 Ã‚Â°C. Addition of a char bed to the second-stage reactor achieved further tar reduction, compared to the empty reactor.
