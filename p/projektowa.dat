50|$|In 1908 the Joint-Stock Association of Wool Products {{owned by}} Frederick Wilhelm Schweikert bought a plot at 223 Wólczańska Street {{of the area}} more than 10 000 m2. Around 1910, a five-storey factory depot {{building}} was erected on the plot. According to the initial assumptions, {{it was to be}} 21 meters wide and about 43 meters long. During the extension in 1913, the building was elongated by nearly 18 meters on the eastern side. Moreover, a tower with a water tank at the top was built in the north-east corner. Nowadays the building is 22 m wide and 100 m long.A few years ago the building and its interior were revitalized and adapted to the needs of a library: floors, window and door woodwork were replaced, ceilings were reinforced, and the interior was converted. The revitalisation design was developed at Autorska Pracownia <b>Projektowa</b> ARTA Sp. z o.o. The formal opening of Library's building was in 2004.|$|E
