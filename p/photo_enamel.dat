50|$|Frederikke Jakobine Federspiel (1839-1913) was {{the first}} female {{photographer}} to practice in Denmark. For many years, she ran her own photographic studio in Aalborg, always keeping abreast of the latest developments. Among her clients were the Danish princesses Dagmar and Alexandra who were attracted by her <b>photo</b> <b>enamel</b> jewelry.|$|E
50|$|In the die struck {{manufacturing}} process, {{there are}} five basic types of pins: cloisonn√©, soft <b>enamel,</b> <b>photo</b> etched, screen printed and 4-color printed. In all processes, the outer shape of the pin is stamped out from a sheet of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, or iron. In the case of cloisonne and soft enamel, the shape and the design are stamped out.|$|R

Enamel surface was irradiated at three different areas with different energy fluences. It is {{demonstrated that the}} ArF excimer laser causes ablation of the calcified hard enamel tissue. Ablation curves were measured. There {{was no significant difference}} found in the etch depth between the three different areas of enamal surface. The morphology of the irradiated areas seen under the SEM was found to be dependent on energy flu-ence. It changed with increase in energy fluence from being etched to forming a smooth, fused, glaze-like surface and then at very high energy fluences producing a rough surface. The influ-ence of the laser irradiation was confined to the irradiated area only, with no visible heat damage to the surroundings. These results suggest that excimer laser could be applied in a controlled and defined manner for tooth enamel treatments in dentistry. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
