We analyze the increase in prices received by apparel exporters who benefited from AGOA preferences. In the presence of competitive markets, export prices should increase as much as the tariff which was previously collected by the US government. We refer to this price increase as the “tariff preference rent ” since exporters receive this income as the rent for their preferential status. The results show that exporters receive only 1 / 3 rd of this rent and smaller exporters receive less than larger and established ones.

Two reasons are complex rules of origin and erosion of preference margins {{as a result of}} multilateral trade liberalization. Our paper contributes to this research by providing evidence from high-quality disaggregated customs data of the utilization rate for Australia's preferential trading arrangements in the period 2000 - 9. A pattern of low ratios of imports receiving <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> treatment to the total value of bilateral imports applies to all six of Australia's PTAs. Over half of Australian imports from New Zealand, the Pacific Island Forum economies, Thailand and Chile claimed preferential treatment in 2000, but all had lower utilization rates by 2009. This is primarily because of the increasing number of zero MFN tariff lines. Where MFN <b>tariffs</b> are positive, <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs</b> are utilized and preferred trading partners pay lower customs duties. Positive utilization rates indicate that tariff preferences do have an impact, and at a minimum the exporters claiming the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> rate are better off than they would be in its absence, but by themselves utilization rates shed no light {{on the size of the}} impact on trade flows or on economic wellbeing. <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs,</b> trade liberalization, preference erosion...|$|R
40|$|The {{preference}} utilization ratio, i. e., {{the share}} of imports under <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> schemes out of total imports, has been a popular indicator for measuring the usage of <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs</b> vis-à-vis tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis. A crucial shortcoming of this measure is the data requirements, particularly for import value data classified by tariff schemes, which are not available in most countries. This study proposes an alternative measure for <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> utilization, termed the "tariff exemption ratio. " This measure offers the unique advantage of needing only publicly available data, such as those provided by the World Development Indicators, for its computations. We can thus calculate this measure for most countries for an international comparison.

40|$|Using {{detailed}} data {{on trade and}} tariffs from 1992 - 2007, the authors examine how the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement has affected trade with nonmembers and external tariffs facing nonmembers. First, the paper examines the effect of <b>preferential</b> and external <b>tariff</b> reduction on import growth from ASEAN insiders and outsiders across HS 6 -digit industries. The analysis finds no evidence that preferential liberalization has led to lower import growth from nonmembers. Second, it examines the relationship between <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction and MFN tariff reduction. The analysis finds that preferential liberalization tends to precede external tariff liberalization. To examine whether this tariff complementarity {{is a result of}} simultaneous decision making, the authors use the scheduled future <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions (agreed to in 1992) as instruments for actual <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> changes after the Asia crisis. The results remain unchanged, suggesting that there is a causal relationship between <b>preferential</b> and MFN <b>tariff</b> reduction. The findings also indicate that external liberalization was relatively sharper in the products where preferences are likely to be most damaging, proving further support for a causal effect. Overall, the results imply that the ASEAN agreement has been a force for broader liberalization.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} related to the theoretical analysis of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Nevertheless, there has been as yet very little empirical research on the topic, in particular, on the negotiating dynamics {{of these types of}} agreements. This paper attempts to make a contribution in this direction examining {{the relationship between the two}} most important market access instruments in the case of NAFTA negotiations: the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> phase-outs and the accompanying rules of origin (RoO). The traditional literature has viewed market access negotiations solely in terms of tariff (and non-tariff) negotiations. From an analytical point of view, the role of RoO, that is the rules that are designed to determine the origin of products in international trade, has usually been restricted to a "secondary" or "supportive" function. As such, RoO were seen to assist in the application or implementation of other "primary" instruments. In the case of preferential RoO, they help to determine when a particular good will be granted <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> treatment. Using a newly constructed data set this paper estimates a simultaneous equation model where the endogenous variables are the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> phase-outs between Mexico and the United States and the RoO under the NAFTA agreement. The empirical findings of this paper support the view that in accordance with recent literature, the NAFTA RoO were used as an independent commercial policy instrument with a "primary" market access function as it is the case with the traditional <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of sunk costs to exporting, <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization may have a prolonged, dynamic effect on the pattern of a beneficiary country's exports. In particular, <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization might trigger a geographic spread of exports to third markets outside the preferential trading area. I test this hypothesis for the pattern of Mexican exports after the inception of NAFTA to several Latin American trading partners. After controlling for product specific shocks and the overall trend in export growth, the evidence {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that initial exports to the United States further prompted exports to third markets. The results suggest a significant impact on exports to large or geographically proximate countries (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama). The stunning growth in the extensive margin as a count measure owes much to rather simple goods, while more sophisticated goods exert a substantial impact on the value of Mexican exports. The findings also document the existence of considerable tariff-induced trade diversion for goods with little skill or technology content. <b>Preferential</b> <b>tariffs,</b> Mexico, NAFTA, sunk costs, conditional logit panel estimation...|$|R
