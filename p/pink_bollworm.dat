5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} global pests {{of cotton}} include the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> Pectinophora gossypiella; the chili thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis; the cotton seed bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis; the tarnish plant bug, Lygus lineolaris; {{and the fall}} armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in North America, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm),</b> has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} Bt {{technology and}} its impact on farming community have been assessed in northern Karnataka based mainly on primary data processed using production functions, decomposition analysis and logit model. On an average, per farm area under Bt cotton was 2. 21 ha, accounting for 66 per cent of the total landholding. With a yield of 24 q/ha, Bt cotton has registered 31 per cent higher yield and 151 per cent higher net return over non-Bt, the net additional benefit being ` 18429 /ha. The non-Bt cotton farmers use chemical fertilizers, organic manures and bullock labour excessively which result in a lower net returns. Technology has been found the major contributor to the total productivity difference between Bt and non- Bt cottons. Seed cost, yield of Bt cotton and cost of plant protection have been found to greatly influence the probability of adoption of Bt cotton. Non-availability of quality seeds and in required quantity have been identified as the most important factors constraining Bt technology adoption. The impact of Bt cotton, as perceived by the farmers, has been in terms of enhanced yield; reduced pest and disease incidence; increased income, employment, education and standard of living; and reduced health risk. To foster adoption, availability of quality and quantity of Bt cotton seed to farmers needs greater attention of development agencies, while researchers’ attention is called for incorporating resistance/ tolerance to Spodoptera and <b>pink</b> <b>bollworms.</b> Bt cotton, Bt technology, Bt crop, Karnataka, Agricultural and Food Policy, Q 16, Q 12,...|$|R

50|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> (Pectinophora gossypiella), lagarta rosada, is {{an insect}} {{known for being}} a pest in cotton farming. The adult is a small, thin, gray moth with fringed wings. The larva is a dull white, eight-legged {{caterpillar}} with conspicuous pink banding along its dorsum. The larva reaches one half inch in length.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} India, the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> is now {{resistant}} to first generation transgenic Bt cotton (Bollgard cotton) that expresses a single Bt gene (Cry1Ac). Monsanto has admitted that this variety is ineffective against the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> pest {{in parts of}} Gujarat, India. Infestation on susceptible cotton is generally controlled with insecticides. Once a crop has been harvested, the field is plowed under {{as soon as possible}} to stop the life cycle of the new generation of bollworm. Unharvested bolls harbor the larvae, so these are destroyed. The plants are plowed into the earth and the fields are irrigated liberally to drown out remaining pests. Some farmers burn the stubble after harvest. Surviving bollworms will overwinter in the field and re-infest the following season. Populations of bollworms are also controlled with mating disruption, chemicals and releases of sterile moths which mate with wild females but fail to fertilize their eggs.|$|E
50|$|Resistance evolves {{naturally}} after {{a population}} {{has been subjected to}} selection pressure via repeated use of a single pesticide. In November 2009, Monsanto scientists found that the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> had become resistant to first generation Bt cotton in parts of Gujarat, India—that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac.

50|$|India’s {{success has}} been subject to scrutiny. Monsanto's seeds are {{expensive}} and lose vigour after one generation, prompting the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to develop a cheaper Bt cotton variety with seeds that could be reused. The cotton incorporated the cry1Ac gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), making the cotton toxic to bollworms. This variety showed poor yield, was removed within a year, and contained a DNA sequence owned by Monsanto, prompting an investigation. In parts of India cases of acquired resistance against Bt cotton have occurred. Monsanto has admitted that the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm</b> is resistant to first generation transgenic Bt cotton that expresses the single Bt gene (Cry1Ac).|$|E
50|$|Pectinophora is a genus of moth in {{the family}} Gelechiidae. Perhaps the best known species is the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders). P. gossypiella {{is one of the}} world's most {{destructive}} insect pests that causes terrible damage to cotton bolls. The larvae (caterpillars) bore into the squares, causing them to fall or the blossoms to fail to open. The larvae tunnel through the immature lint and into the seeds eating them. As a result the lint may be unpickable or so stunted as to greatly lower the yield and grade. The yield of oil from the seeds is greatly reduced. Double seeds are found when the cotton is gained, two partly eaten seeds being fastened together.|$|E
50|$|Field {{programmes}} releasing irradiated moths {{under an}} SIT or inherited sterility approach {{have been in}} operation since the 1960s. The <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> Pectinophora gossypiella has been successfully contained since 1969 in cotton areas of the San Joaquin Valley in California and is being successfully targeted for eradication from cotton areas in the south-western USA and north-western Mexico. Since the early 1990s, the codling moth has been successfully suppressed in apple and pear production areas in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada, and countries such as Argentina, Brazil and South Africa have plans or programmes against this pest. New Zealand eradicated outbreaks of the Australian painted apple moth, Teia anartoides. Mexico eradicated outbreaks of the cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum and the USA contains its advance along the Gulf of Mexico coast. South Africa has a programme to suppress the false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta in citrus orchardsControl of most moth pests is hampered by the increased resistance to {{the most widely used}} broad spectrum insecticides; hence the potential for expanded implementation of inherited sterility as part of an area-wide integrated approach is considerable.|$|E

However, this advice was criticized: [...] "an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events is, the first-generation Bollgard I product and promote double genes second generation Bollgard II which would fetch higher price.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Big-eyed bugs {{are true}} bugs {{in the order}} Hemiptera. The two most common species are Geocoris pallens and Geocoris punctipes. Both are predators and occur in many habitats, {{including}} fields, gardens, and turf grass. Big-eyed bugs are considered an important predator in many agricultural systems and feed on mites, insect eggs, and small insects such as <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> cabbage loopers, and whiteflies. Adult big-eyed bugs are small (about 3 mm) black, gray, or tan with proportionately large eyes. Eggs are deposited singly or in clusters on leaves near potential prey. They develop with incomplete metamorphosis (there is no pupa) and take approximately 30 days to develop from egg to adult depending on temperature. Both nymphs and adults are predatory, but can survive on nectar and honeydew when prey are scarce. Big-eyed bugs, like other true bugs, have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by stabbing their prey and sucking or lapping the juices. Although their effectiveness as predators is not well understood, {{studies have shown that}} nymphs can eat as many as 1600 spider mites before reaching adulthood, while adults have been reported consuming as many as 80 mites per day.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{protection}} {{strategy and}} activities have significant {{importance in the}} overall crop production programmes for sustainable agriculture. Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton {{in the field is}} losing efficacy against the <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on red and dusky cotton bugs continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early sown field than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. & non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.|$|E
5000|$|Pheromone {{programs}} {{are most effective}} when controlling low to moderate pest population densities. MD has also {{been identified as a}} pest control method in which the insect does not become resistant1. The scientific community, together with governmental agencies throughout the world, understands the benefits of mating disruption using species-specific sex pheromones, and consider sex-pheromone-based insect control programs among the most environmentally friendly treatments to be used to manage and control insect pest populations. Insect pheromone has been successfully used as an effective tool to slow the spread and to eradicate pests from very large areas in the US; for example to control the Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), a devastating forestry pest, and to eradicate the boll weevil and <b>pink</b> <b>bollworm,</b> two of the most damaging pest of cotton. Conventional pesticide based control methods, kill insects directly, whereas mating disruption confuses male insects from accurately locating a mating partner, leading to the eventual collapse of the mating cycle3. Mating disruption, due to the specificity of the sex pheromone of the insect species, has the benefit of only affecting the males of that species, while leaving other non target species unaffected3. This allows for very targeted pest management, promoting the suppression of a single pest species, leaving the populations of beneficial insects (pollinators and natural enemies) intact. Mating disruption, like most pest management strategies, is a useful technique, but should not be considered a stand-alone treatment program1 for it targets only a single species in plant production systems that usually have several pests of concern. Mating disruption is a valuable tool that should be used in Integrated Pest Management(IPM) programs.|$|E
