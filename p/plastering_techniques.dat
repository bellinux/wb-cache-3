40|$|Morphfaux is an applied {{research}} project that revisits the virtually lost craft of plaster to explore {{its potential for}} producing thickened architectural environments {{through the use of}} contemporary digital technology. The research challenges the flatness of modern, standardized dry wall construction and explores plaster’s malleability as a material that can be applied thick and thin, finished to appear smooth or textured, and tooled while liquid or cured. If the invention of industrialized modern building products such as drywall led to the demise of the plasterer as a tradesperson, our research seeks alliances between the abilities of the human hand and those of automation. By transforming historic methods using new robotic tools, Morphfaux has broadened the possibilities of architectural plaster. While our research has produced forms not possible by human skill alone, it also clearly illustrates a symbiotic relationship between the human body and robotic machines where human dexterity and robotic precision are choreographed in the production of innovative <b>plastering</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{plastered}} facades on historical buildings. The three {{sections of the}} thesis illuminate architectural, technical and historical aspects. The sections of the book are: - The Role of Plaster in Architecture; - Plaster and Plastering: Changes in Practice and Perspective; - The Building as a Source of Knowledge about Plaster. The first part describes the connection that exist between the architecture of plaster and the special and unique properties of plaster, for instance the link between architectural expression of a facade and the material qualities of plaster. The second part deals with the changes that plaster and plastering practices have undergone {{during the period of}} transition from traditional to modern <b>plastering</b> <b>techniques</b> - between the thirties and the sixties - and reflects how perspectives on both the material and the architecture of plaster have altered. These changes were part of the process that involved the transformation of the towns and the industrialization of building. Investigation of these changes enables us to acquire a perspective on the attitudes prevailing today - the renewed interest in traditional materials and methods, amongst other things - and on how old plastered buildings are maintained, repaired and restored. The third part deals with the question of how, {{on the basis of a}} historical perspective and the experience of former times, old plastered facades should be taken care of, repaired and renovated. The answer should be found in the building itself; in the way its plastered facades were once erected and in their condition at the present time. Not until the building has been carefully examined measures can be suggested; materials and methods for repairs or restoration should be matched to the original. The choice of materials and selection of the mode of execution become relatively simple processes if the building is well-researched and the specification is professionally compiled. Two appendices, published earlier, that belong to this thesis are: Renovering och restaurering av putsade fasader.

40|$|The {{management}} of the acute tibial fracture is controversial, since no single method is appropriate in all circumstances and treatment indications often overlap. Given the potential problems in the {{management of}} this often difficult fracture, {{it is important that the}} attending clinician be familiar with both operative and conservative methods of treatment. In recent years, operative intervention has become increasingly popular, particularly the use of the intra-medullary locking nail, but such techniques are not without complications, including delayed union, non-union, malunion and infection. The authors strongly believe that conservative treatment remains an important option in the treatment armamentarium. A <b>plastering</b> <b>technique</b> is therefore described which is easy to perform, maintains good reduction and avoids the need for skilled assistance, excessive analgesia or an anaesthetic. It can be performed when the patient is initially assessed in the accident department, and it has a definitive role in the treatment of closed tibial fractures...|$|R
40|$|The Ponseti {{technique}} of manipulation and casting {{is reported to}} have almost eliminated the need for extensive soft tissue release in the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot. This {{technique of}} treatment has however not been universally adopted and results of treatment vary significantly between treatment centres. Furthermore, surgical decision making in the treatment of clubfoot is currently largely based on clinical findings as opposed to radiographic parameters. The Ponseti method of manipulation and casting was introduced at our institution in 2002, prior to which we used the Kite method. Both prior to, and following the introduction of Ponseti casting, surgical decision making was based on pre-operative radiology, and intra-operative clinical assessment. We propose to determine the impact on this change of <b>plastering</b> <b>technique</b> on the rate of major surgery performed primarily in our patients with idiopathic clubfoot.

5000|$|Bartlett’s pre-Raphaelite murals {{are one of}} {{the glories}} of the sanctuary, and they were widely {{published}} after their completion. [...] From a well-to-do Chicago family, Bartlett had studied painting at Munich’s Royal Academy and with masters in Paris. For Second Presbyterian, Bartlett sought inspiration in the work of medieval church painters. He consciously rejected the post-Renaissance artistic tradition, with its emphasis on perspective and verisimilitude. Bartlett preferred to focus on expressiveness and spirituality, which he found in the flat and serene figures painted on the walls of medieval Italian churches. Bartlett painted directly on the dry plaster of the sanctuary’s vertical walls. The paintings in the ceilings of the arches were done on canvas in his studio and then mounted in the church. Bartlett’s figures have bold outlines and sumptuous robes of muted blue, crimson, and green. He used gold leaf extensively and supplied relief to features like haloes with a <b>plaster</b> <b>technique</b> known as pargeting.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for merging two intersecting finite elements is presented and demonstrated. The solution mimics concepts from biology and uses principles rooted in continuum mechanics. The problem of attaching (or merging) two coincident finite elements is common {{when using the}} <b>plastering</b> <b>technique</b> {{as part of the}} advancing front method. This problem is particularly challenging for 3 -D meshes of non-convex shapes. Some automatic meshing methods require portions of the partially formed mesh to coincide and merge. This problem is generally solved with heuristic rules, which lack generality, and may have difficulties with unforeseen situations. The problem of merging two overlapping polyhedra may also appear in other applications such as computer graphics and CAD software. A new approach {{to address the problem of}} merging is presented here. This solution does not utilize heuristic rules, but rather uses an approach based on minimization of strain energy. A fully automatic merging routine has been created that can address, in an optimum way, any situation of two nearby or overlapping elements that are to be merged. This approach, with minor adjustments, is suitable for mos...|$|R

50|$|Hadum Mosques {{features}} {{paintings and}} arabesques {{which are also}} found {{on the walls of}} Islamic-Albanian sacral buildings. The interior of the domes is filled with murals of secco (dry <b>plaster)</b> <b>techniques.</b> The main motifes are stylized landscapes (in some cases with motifs of folk architecture, of kullas of Dukagin plain) with cypress trees, still nature, stars, motifs of architectural religious buildings - mosques, floral ornaments, geometrical figures and quotations for Qur'an. The mural paintings are more present in mihrab, mimber, mahfil, the crown, niches, arches and tropes. In the written names of Allah, Mohammed and his successors the red, blue, green, ochre, grey and black colors are dominant. This also shows the Islamic-Albanian baroque style. There are three layers of mural decorations. The first two layers are believed to belong to the 17th or 18th century, while the third decorated layer, according to Hijri and the date written in the timpanonin, was built in 1844. A very special part of the Arabesque are the sound tubes that look like black dots. The construction of these tubes, as told by Mimar Sinan, was to gain: a higher volume and voice extension inside the mosque, and a greater acoustic inside and out of the mosque.|$|R

30|$|Breakage of spica cast {{before the}} {{intended}} {{period of application}} is a relatively common problem {{in the management of}} DDH [2, 3]. Various modifications in <b>plastering</b> <b>technique</b> have been described to strengthen the spica cast. Hosalkar et al. reported hip spica failure occurring at the pelvis-femoral junction and remedied the failure by adding a leg-to-leg connecting bar [2]. No failure was reported and patients’ carers had significant satisfaction, as the bar provided a place to carry a child in hip spica. However, this technique would require additional time and cast material to construct the connecting bar. Chaudhry et al. modified the leg-to-leg connecting bar by replacing the bar with a fibreglass bar [4]. The bar was constructed with existing fibreglass material and no pre-casting preparation of the bar was required, which reduced the procedure time. Curtis et al. published a technique of treating paediatric femoral fractures with hip spica modified into a pontoon spica that incorporated a wooden splint at the fractured side of the limb [5]. The intention was to splint the fractured femur with a stable hip spica construct and the authors recommended that it was a strong technique for children up to 10  years old. This technique would require pre-operative preparation of the wooden splint in a suitable dimension, and breakage at the thigh region (site of femur fracture) is not common in the management of DDH.|$|R

In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of Nax Mont-Noble, construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. The Harrison Vault, in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and <b>plaster.</b> The <b>technique</b> was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.

The enormous wall was prepared with the smooth plaster needed for this, with Michelangelo apparently acquiescent. There may even have been the idea floated that Sebastiano might do the painting to Michelangelo's designs. Michelangelo may also have tried painting in oils on the smooth surface. It is clear that several months after the idea of using oils first appeared, Michelangelo finally and furiously rejected it, and insisted that the whole wall be re-plastered in the rough arriccio needed as a base for fresco. [...] It was on this occasion that he famously said that oil painting was [...] "an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano".|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many {{techniques}} {{have been devised}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with posterior soft tissue injuries.

Invasive techniques using external fixators as described by Berkowitz and Kim using tubular fixators like "kick back stand" and by Kamath using ring Illizarov fixators. The external fixators have their own problems like maintaining them for weeks and pin tract infection. Materials and Methods: We have tried to achieve as noninvasive technique using a Bohler stirrup incorporated with slab for patients with only soft tissue in injury and in a fixator for patients with skeletal injury already on tubular fixators. Results: In all the 12 cases where this method was used, the authors achieved the purpose of protecting the split skin graft in four cases and flap in eight cases. We did not encounter any problems related to this method such as skin maceration, sores including loosening of the frame.

50|$|Batches of {{pigmented}} plaster (ground alabaster or gypsum) modified {{with animal}} glue {{are applied to}} molds, armatures and pre-plastered wall planes {{in a manner that}} accurately mimics natural stone, breccia and marble. In one technique, veining is created by drawing strands of raw silk saturated in pigment through the <b>plaster</b> mix. Another <b>technique</b> involves trowelling on several layers of translucent renders and randomly cutting back to a previous layer to achieve colour differential similar to jasper. When dry, the damp surface was pumiced smooth, then buffed with a linen cloth impregnated with Tripoli (a siliceous rottenstone) and charcoal; finally it was buffed with oiled felt; beeswax was sometimes used for this purpose. Because the colours are integral to the plaster, the pattern is more resistant to scratching than with other techniques, such as painting on wood.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the stabilization, {{conservation}} and strengthening of historic plaster fabrics based on nanofibers. As a result of degradation processes, in particular the chemical nature, accompanied by increased humidity of the historical masonry, there is a loss of coherence and disturbance of the surface finishes and <b>plasters.</b> Traditional remediation <b>techniques</b> and methods normally lead to a reduction of diffuse permeability in multiphase structure and create different expansion properties under the plaster. The undesirable features of these methods are their irreversible character. Currently, there are primarily preferred procedures which stabilize {{the structure of the}} external finishes {{and at the same time}} preserve the original features of the historical plasters.

40|$|Between {{the end of}} the 17 th {{century and}} {{the first decades of the}} 18 th, Sicily was struck by several violent earthquakes. The total and partial {{collapse}} of monumental buildings produced a global debate involving various aspects of construction practice. One of the central topics of discussion was the construction of domes and large vaulted structures. Some architects studied the possibility of using so-called ‘false vaults’, a kind of lightweight structure created with a wooden frame, reed mats, and <b>plaster.</b> The <b>technique</b> was probably known by the 16 th century and was used in a few major monuments, such as the dome of the Palermo Cathedral, in the mid- 17 th century. It was only after the Earthquake of 1726 in Palermo that large vaulted structures were extensively built with this technique in important churches. One of the most significant examples, documented by technical drawings as well as archival records, is the church of Santa Chiara in Noto, designed by the architect Rosario Gagliardi. The use of ‘false vaults’ as a preventative measure against seismic damage is well documented in many other monuments. The direct analysis of built structures and new documentary evidence allows for the verification of recent theories. The paper focus on the construction techniques used in a few selected cases and takes into consideration the influences of widely available texts on architectural theory and practice as well as local building experiences on the genesis of the building process...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of the implants inclination on the accuracy of the working cast obtained by two different pouring techniques. A metallic matrix containing two implants, positioned at 90 and 65 degrees in relation to the alveolar ridge, was submitted to the direct transfer impression technique. In CP group (conventional pouring - n= 10), the impressions were poured with dental stone type IV using the conventional technique. In EP group (experimental pouring - n= 10), the analogs were embraced with latex tubes before the first pouring. After sixty minutes, these tubes were removed and the space was filled with the dental stone. The metallic matrix (control group) and the replicas were evaluated regarding the implant/analog inclination and the vertical misfit between a framework and the implants/analogs. The data were tabulated and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test at the 0. 05 level of significance. Regarding the analog inclination, both experimental groups differed statistically (p< 0. 05) from the control group only in relation to the leaning analogs. Results demonstrated significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the control group and the experimental groups when the reading of the vertical misfit was accomplished in the perpendicular implant/analog with the retention screw in the leaning implant/analog and between the control group and the EP group in the opposite situation. Considering the inclination, perpendicular implants produced more accurate casts independently of the <b>plaster</b> pouring <b>technique...</b>|$|R

Whilst he initially wanting to study fine painting in fine art, due to impaired vision (from an accident as a child) he had difficulty in seeing and mixing colours and realised that he had more of an affinity with three-dimensional art. The early sculptures of Hitchcock were exploratory in nature and diverse in technique and style.

40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{designing}} and manufacturing custom orthotics include manual {{techniques such as}} casting a limb in plaster, making a plaster duplicate of the limb to be treated and forming a polymer orthotic directly onto the <b>plaster</b> model. Such <b>techniques</b> are usually accompanied with numerous postmanufacture alterations to adapt the orthotic for patient comfort. External modeling techniques rely heavily on the skill of the clinician, as the axes of rotation of any joint are partially specified by the skeletal structure and are not completely inferable from the skin, especially in cases where edema is present. Clinicians could benefit from a simultaneous view of external and skeletal patient-specific geometry. In addition to providing more information to clinicians, quantification of patient-specific data would allow rapid production of advanced orthotics, requiring machining rather than casting. This paper presents a supplemental method of orthotic design and fitting, through 3 D reconstruction of medical imaging data to parameterise an orthotic design based on a major axis of rotation, shape of rigid components and placement of skin contact surfaces.

5000|$|Cultural {{tendencies of}} this period differ {{from that of the}} earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period in that people living during this period began to depend more heavily upon domesticated animals to {{supplement}} their earlier mixed agrarian and hunter-gatherer diet. In addition the flint tool kit of the period is new and quite disparate from that of the earlier period. One of its major elements is the [...] core. This is the first period in which architectural styles of the southern Levant became primarily rectilinear; earlier typical dwellings were circular, elliptical and occasionally even octagonal. Pyrotechnology was highly developed in this period. During this period, one of the main features of houses is evidenced by a thick layer of white clay plaster floors highly polished and made of lime produced from limestone. It is believed that the use of clay plaster for floor and wall coverings during PPNB led to the discovery of pottery. The earliest proto-pottery was White Ware vessels, made from lime and gray ash, built up around baskets before firing, for several centuries around 7000 BC at sites such as Tell Neba'a Faour (Beqaa Valley). Sites from this period found in the Levant utilizing rectangular floor plans and <b>plastered</b> floor <b>techniques</b> were found at Ain Ghazal, Yiftahel (western Galilee), and Abu Hureyra (Upper Euphrates). The period is dated to between ca. 10,700 and ca. 8,000 BP or 7000 - 6000 BCE.Danielle Stordeur's recent work at Tell Aswad, a large agricultural village between Mount Hermon and Damascus could not validate Henri de Contenson's earlier suggestion of a PPNA Aswadian culture. Instead, they found evidence of a fully established PPNB culture at 8700 BC at Aswad, pushing back the period's generally accepted start date by 1,200 years. Similar sites to Tell Aswad in the Damascus Basin of the same age were found at Tell Ramad and Tell Ghoraifé. How a PPNB culture could spring up in this location, practicing domesticated farming from 8700 BC {{has been the subject of}} speculation. Whether it created its own culture or imported traditions from the North East or Southern Levant has been considered an important question for a site that poses a problem for the scientific community.|$|R
