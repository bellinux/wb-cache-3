25|$|In the 20th century, the {{scientific}} study of the volcano was interrupted by the political instability in the region. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century Nemrut was wrongly classified as an extinct volcano. Only in the 1980s, with the resumption of the studies, its status was changed to dormant. Currently Nemrut is mainly studied by Turkish volcanologists. The volcano is still poorly understood, and there is no consensus on the interpretation of stratigraphic data. Analysis of the sediments of Lake Van, which is near the volcano, allowed clarification of the chronology and activity of recent eruptions. The <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> of Nemrut and the close proximity of several Turkish cities inspired recent in-depth studies. In October 2003, the first in Turkey real-time seismic network of sensors has been installed around the volcano. During the first three years of operation the network has registered 133 seismic events with a magnitude of 1.3–4.0.|$|E

5000|$|Potentially, DARPins {{can provide}} {{clinical}} benefit by overcoming {{the limitations of}} conventional therapeutic approaches, which typically target a single disease pathway and thus may compromise efficacy. In many cases, the complexity of a disease results from the dysregulation of multiple pathways.

DARPins and multi-DARPins can also be fused to non-DARPin elements, such as a toxin, to generate targeted therapeutics, and their manufacture is facilitated by the resistance of DARPins against aggregation. The diversity of formats and robustness of multi-DARPins facilitates an empirical approach (such as through outcome-based screening) to efficiently identify DARPins with <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> in specific disease pathways.|$|E

5000|$|Homeostatic {{plasticity}} manages synaptic connections {{across the}} entire cell {{in an attempt to}} keep them at manageable connection levels. Hebbian methods tend to drive networks into either a maximized state or a minimized state of firing, thus limiting the <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> and growth of the network. With homeostatic mechanisms in place there is now a sort of [...] "gain control" [...] which allows these Hebbian methods to be checked in order to maintain their information processing abilities. This kind of modulation is important to combat intense lack of neural activity, such as prolonged sensory deprivation (in this study in particular it is light-deprivation affecting visual cortex neurons) or damage caused by stroke. Synaptic scaling is a mechanism in place to hold synapse sensitivity at normalized levels. Prolonged periods of inactivity increase the sensitivity of the synapses so that their overall activity level can remain useful. Chronic activity causes desensitization of the receptors, lowering overall activity to a more biologically manageable level. Both AMPA and NMDA receptor levels are affected by this process and so the overall [...] "weight" [...] of each synaptic connection (refined by Hebbian methods) is maintained while still increasing the overall level of activity over the entire neuron. It has been shown that both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron are involved in the process, changing the vesicle turnover rate and AMPA receptor composition respectively.|$|E

50|$|Current {{research}} {{is attempting to}} learn more about end plate potentials and their effect on muscle activity. Many current diseases involve disrupted end plate <b>potential</b> <b>activity.</b> In Alzheimer patients, beta amyloid attaches to the acetylcholine receptors and inhibits acetylcholine binding. This causes less signal propagation and small EPPs that do not reach threshold. By analyzing brain processes with acetylcholine, doctors can measure how much beta amyloid is around and use it to judge its effects on Alzheimer's.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, where the body produces antibodies targeted against the acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. Muscle fatigue and weakness, worsened with use and improved by rest, is the hallmark of the disease. Because of the limited amount of acetylcholine receptors that are available for binding, symptomatic treatment consists of using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to reduce the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, so that enough acetylcholine will be present for the small number of unblocked receptorsA congenital abnormality caused by a deficiency in end-plate acetylcholine esterase (AChE) might be a pathophysiologic mechanism for myasthenic gravis. In a study on a patient with AChE deficiency, doctors noted that he had developed severe proximal and truncal muscle weakness with jittering in other muscles. It was found that a combination of the jitter and blocking rate of the acetylcholine receptors caused a reduced end-plate potential similar to what is seen in cases of myasthenia gravis.Research of motor unit potentials (MUPs) has led to possible clinical applications in the evaluation of the progression of pathological diseases to myogenic or neurogenic origins by measuring the irregularity constant related. Motor unit potentials are the electrical signals produced by motor units that can be characterized by amplitude, duration, phase, and peak, and the irregularity coefficient (IR) is calculated based on the peak numbers and amplitudes.Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a disorder where presynaptic calcium channels are subjected to autoimmune destruction which causes fewer neurotransmitter vesicles to be exocytosed. This causes smaller EPPs due to less vesicles being released. Often the smaller EPPs do not reach threshold which causes muscle weakness and fatigue in patients. Many animals use neurotoxins to defend themselves and kill prey. Tetrodotoxin is a poison found in the certain poisonous fishes such as pufferfish and triggerfish which blocks the sodium ion channels and prevents an action potential on the postsynaptic membrane. Tetraethylammonium found in insects blocks potassium channels. Alpha neurotoxin found in snakes binds to acetylcholine receptors and prevents acetylcholine from binding. Alpha-latrotoxin found in black widow spiders causes a massive influx of calcium at the axon terminal and leads to an overflow of neurotransmitter release.Botulinum toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum is the most powerful toxic protein. It prevents release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting docking of the neurotransmitter vesicles.|$|E

40|$|Whole {{cell voltage}} clamp {{measurements}} using the patch technique on well-attached and well-spread cells of an osteoblastlike line (ROS 17 / 2. 8) {{show the same}} spontaneous membrane <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> as measurements with inserted microelectrodes. Furthermore, membrane potential measurements during the first 80 milliseconds (ms) following microelectrode penetration of the cell membrane usually show no decay. There is also good agreement between values of cell membrane resistance obtained by the microelectrode technique, the whole cell patch clamp technique, and the single channel patch clamp technique. These results indicate that our microelectrode measurements are not dominated by leak-induced artifacts, and that the spontaneous membrane <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> is not induced by Ca 2 + leakage around the microelectrode. The spontaneous membrane <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> is eliminated {{in the presence of}} the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187, also in serum-free medium, and by K+ and Ca 2 + channel blockers, but it is not affected by the hyperpolarizing responses to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and dibutyryl cAMP, which persist under all of these conditions. These results support the hypothesis that the spontaneous membrane <b>potential</b> <b>activity</b> is related to repeated fluctuations of internal [Ca 2 +] and that such fluctuations result from a feedback loop involving Ca 2 + channels or Ca 2 + pumps in the cell membrane.
