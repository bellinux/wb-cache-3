40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{personalized}} web application for the weeding of printed resources: the FachRef-Assistant. It offers an extensive range of tools for evidence based stock management, based on the thorough analysis of usage statistics. Special {{attention is paid to}} the criteria individualization, transparency of the parameters used, and generic functions. Currently, it is designed to work with the Aleph-System from ExLibris, but efforts were spent to keep the application as generic as possible. For example, all procedures specific to the local library system have been collected in one Java package. The inclusion of library specific properties such as collections and systematics has been designed to be highly generic as well by mapping the individual entries onto an in-memory database. Hence simple adaption of the package and the mappings would render the FachRef-Assistant compatible to other library systems. The personalization of the application allows for the inclusion of subject specific usage properties as well as of variations between different collections within one subject area. The parameter sets used to analyse the stock and to prepare weeding and <b>purchase</b> <b>proposal</b> lists are included in the output XML-files to facilitate a high degree of transparency, objectivity and reproducibility...|$|E
40|$|There is {{some degree}} of misperception {{concerning}} {{the superiority of the}} competitive sale as the evidence suggests that large portion of municipal emissions take the form of negotiated purchase. The following article describes the procedure for negotiation of the eventual bond emissions in municipality of Shtip, Republic of Macedonia. The aim is to predetermine the most cost-effective method for evaluation of underwriter’s municipal bond <b>purchase</b> <b>proposal</b> due to the substantial inexperience and deficit of expertise of the city’s internal services. The literature offers various measures available to compare the relative costs of bond financing proposals. While net interest cost and net-present value are considered improper, it is thought that the best reliance for the purpose comes from the true interest cost method. The procedure incorporates calculation of true interest cost and duration of the underwriter’s proposal and matching them with those for a sample group of similar bonds. In this particular case, as there are no other municipals to compare with, that would be the only available bond market index of the Macedonian Stock Exchange named OMB, with a portfolio completely made of long-term government securities...|$|E
40|$|The debate {{continues}} {{about the}} most cost-effective method of issuing municipal securities. The emergence of online securities marketing will add {{a new dimension to}} this debate. Some analysts argue that the competitive sale process is the most advantageous because of the inherent protections of open bidding. Others argue that a negotiated sale produces comparable financing costs and affords issuers considerably more flexibility in the marketing of municipal securities. However, the negotiated sale remains the dominant bond marketing strategy. Thus, it is important for issuers to have tools to accurately and fairly evaluate the actual costs of proposed bond offerings. This paper reviews the techniques that are available for comparing alternative pricing proposals and examines their strengths and weaknesses. It includes a description of a process that issuers of negotiated offerings can use to determine the appropriateness of a proposed pricing along with a description of a computer-based evaluation model. Issuers of municipal bonds can use either of two marketing strategies the competitive sale and the negotiated sale. While there continues to be debate about which strategy is the most cost-effective, negotiated bond sales have become increasingly more common, a trend that is consistent with practices in the corporate bond market. This article describes a process that an issuer of municipal bonds sold by negotiated sale can use to evaluate an underwriter's <b>purchase</b> <b>proposal</b> on the day a bon...|$|E

40|$|This case {{focuses on}} an {{emerging}} tech, digital media, and entertainment industry {{market with a}} stringent entitlement environment, and {{the opportunity for a}} developer to create an innovative project that capitalizes on emerging trends. The case asks students to propose a development strategy for a featured site taking into account a wide range of variables and potential uses. The developer, The Oceanic Fund (TOF), has been invited to submit a <b>purchase</b> <b>proposal</b> for a compelling property that had recently come onto the market. In their proposal, TOF must elect to either purchase the asset outright or, alternatively, form a 50 / 50 joint venture with the seller – Mays McCovey – a creditor that has recently taken title to the asset pursuant to a foreclosure on the previous developer/owner. The case’s protagonist is Ben Taylor, a young Development Manager who has been tasked with devising a strategy for the projec, and preparing a proposal to TOF’s principals. Students must assess the project through Ben’s eyes and devise a strategy that accomplishes a suitable use(s) for the site that is feasible within the entitlement and financing environment, satisfies TOF’s return requirements, and intelligently capitalizes on the opportunities borne out of an emerging market. The proposed project gives students exposure to niche product types such as sound stages, recording studios, and creative office, in addition to more conventional asset types such as retail, residential, and hospitality.

The conference issued a petition to the U.S. Congress, signed by 256 people, requesting organization of the territory and elected Nathan P. Cook as the territorial delegate to Congress. In January 1857, the bill for the organization of the territory was introduced into the House of Representatives, but the proposal was defeated on the grounds that the population of the proposed territory was yet too small. Later a similar proposal was defeated in the Senate. The proposal for creation of the territory was controversial in part because of the perception that the New Mexico Territory was under the influence of southern sympathizers who were highly desirous of expanding slavery into the southwest.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1800s, {{the area}} {{now known as}} Gypsy Hill Park served as the water supply {{for the city of}} Staunton via a local pumping plant that {{utilized}} the many underwater springs found in the area. In order to protect the surrounding area, Staunton city ended up purchasing around 30 acres of land by 1876. By 1890, the city had purchased sixty more acres. Since all of this land had been <b>purchased,</b> a <b>proposal</b> was formed and mailed to the city’s council which moved that a public park be created with the current resources. After the proposition was passed, the lands between Churchville Avenue and the Baldwin Fair Association were designated as the perimeter for the new park, thanks to the planning of Staunton resident, Captain W.P. Tams, along with others. It {{came to be known as}} Gypsy Hill Park due to the high traffic of wandering gypsies that passed through the area on their nomadic trips. In order to accommodate more park features, Staunton City bought Baldwin Fairgrounds, a local park which already had a repertoire of activities that drew people to the site. As the park grew, so did its attractions, including an in-park zoo that became a prominent feature to visitors in 1893.|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} development, {{the population}} growth and the rural-urban migration create a huge demand on the Vietnamese housing market. At the same moment {{there is a growing}} <b>purchasing</b> power, but <b>proposals</b> have to be elaborated within strict budget constraints. Developers, avoiding risks and striving to maximize profit, supply in most cases very stereotype units. The government would like to stimulate the development of the housing stock in a sustainable way but has limited resources. The basic aim of this research is to develop a simulation tool that is adaptable to specific requirements and expandable in order to come to a win-win-win situation: better quality for end users within budget, opportunities to implement a social policy and reasonable profits for mobilising private funding. The starting point is the element method for cost control from sketch design to detailed design. The method is expanded in three ways: (1) better estimating from the first sketch on land cost and costs for pile foundation for high-rise building in soft soil condition of the Mekong delta, (2) taking into account preferences of end users (renters or buyers) derived in a semi-automatic way from selected internet advertising (3) achieving thermal and visual comfort via decision on different scale levels from urban clustering and orientation, over building layout up to material selection. For this last point two original contributions are elaborated: (a) the development of a surrogate model for predicting pressure coefficients (Cp) used to estimate air flow exchange via natural ventilation. (b) the implementation of an “Energy Management System” (EMS) to simulate, via a dynamic modelling, the occupant behaviour to minimize energy use as much as possible with passive means. In a final step the optimization process of life cycle costs is elaborated by coupling a general optimisation software (“GenOpt”) with dynamic energy and light simulations including life cycle costing (“EnergyPlus”) linked to the meta model for estimating costs of pile foundation for high rise buildings in soft soil conditions. The graphical representations {{of the results of the}} optimisation can support in the early design phase developers, designers, users and policy makers to come to better solutions.
