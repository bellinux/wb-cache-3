5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic <b>pull-out</b> system. Releasing the bomb initiated the <b>pull-out,</b> or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.|$|E

These include sport and business supplements each Monday, a Down Your Way local news supplement on Tuesdays, jobs, junior football and nostalgia features on Wednesdays, an entertainment supplement, cars guide and nostalgia stories on Thursdays and a property <b>pull-out</b> on Fridays. The Saturday edition includes a leisure <b>pull-out,</b> featuring fashion, entertainment and restaurant reviews, while a local history nostalgia supplement, Retro, is published once a month. Nostalgia calendars, featuring old photographs of Sunderland and Seaham, are also produced.|$|E
5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical <b>pull-out</b> plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E

5|$|In December, after former East German leader Erich Honecker {{was issued}} {{an arrest warrant}} by {{prosecutors}} in Berlin and charged with giving orders to fire on escapees, Snetkov refused to hand over Honecker, who was under Soviet protection at a military hospital. He opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, and stated in multiple early 2000s interviews with Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that his opposition to a Soviet <b>pull-out</b> {{was the reason for}} his dismissal from command of the WGF later that month. However, according to a contemporary Izvestia report, he was fired along with deputies after the desertions of a regimental commander and a supply unit leader on 29 November, who took two missiles, three tank shells and other armaments with them. After his dismissal, Snetkov joined the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, traditionally a pre-retirement post for elderly generals. He retired in May 1992 after the elimination of the Group of Inspectors General.|$|E

25|$|Breaststroke {{uses the}} regular start for swimming. Some {{swimmers}} use a variant called the frog start, where the legs are pulled forward sharply before being extended again quickly during the airborne {{phase of the}} start. After the start a gliding phase follows under water, followed by one underwater pulldown and dolphin kick, then one whip kick as the hands are recovered back to a streamline. This {{is known as the}} <b>pull-out.</b> The head must break the surface before the arms reach their widest point on the first stroke after the <b>pull-out.</b> The downward butterfly kick was legalized by FINA, WWF and the NCAA in 2005, and remains optional. The downward fly kick is now allowed in MCSL.|$|E

25|$|The Raffles Academy (RA), {{implemented}} in 2007, is a programme {{for students with}} higher capabilities in specific subjects. RA offers a curriculum pitched at a deeper level.

40|$|A loose {{abrasive}} lapping {{technology was}} developed for truing and dressing ultrafine diamond cup wheels for grinding spherical end faces of fibre optic connectors. The relative densities of exposed grits and grit <b>pull-outs</b> measured from wheel surfaces prepared using the loose abrasive lapping and the bonded abrasive dressing were compared. It {{was found that the}} lapping method with loose abrasives produced wheel surfaces with more exposed grits and less grit <b>pull-outs,</b> especially for finer grit size wheels. For dressing ultrafine grit size wheels, the particle size of the lapping paste should be smaller than the wheel grit size to achieve a better result. It is also found that the wheels dressed using the lapping method demonstrate an excellent grinding performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V [...] All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|In 1979, Egypt and Israel {{signed a}} peace treaty in which Israel agreed to {{withdraw}} from the entirety of Sinai. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending in 1982. The Israeli <b>pull-out</b> involved dismantling almost all Israeli settlements, including the settlement of Yamit in north-eastern Sinai. The exception was the coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh, which the Israelis had founded as Ofira during the period of their occupation. The Treaty allows monitoring of Sinai by the Multinational Force and Observers, and limits the number of Egyptian military forces in the peninsula.|$|E

The 1972 changing {{of the name of}} the Socialist Party of America to SDUSA and the 1973 formation of DSOC represented a split in the U.S.socialist movement.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 1991, whilst {{supportive}} {{of their respective}} rights to national self-determination, the European Community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month moratorium on their independence with the Brijuni Agreement (recognized by representatives of all republics).

Negotiations to restore the Yugoslav federation with diplomat Lord Peter Carington {{and members of the}} European Community were all but ended. Carington's plan realized that Yugoslavia {{was in a state of}} dissolution and decided that each republic must accept the inevitable independence of the others, along with a promise to Serbian President Milošević that the European Union would ensure that Serbs outside of Serbia would be protected.|$|E
5000|$|A 90-minute one-size-fits-all {{solution}} for every gifted child is inappropriate. <b>Pull-outs</b> {{must be part}} of a larger context including in-class differentiation, independent study, subject and whole-grade acceleration (grade skipping), distance learning, dual enrollment, AP courses, and mentorship.

25|$|On 11 February 1964, two pilots {{from the}} 1st Air Commando Wing {{stationed}} at Hurlburt Field, Fla., {{died in the}} crash of a B-26 on Range 52 at Eglin AFB when it lost a wing during <b>pull-out</b> from a strafing pass. The aircraft was participating in {{a demonstration of the}} Special Air Warfare Center's counter insurgency capabilities and had completed a strafing run when the accident occurred. SAWC had presented the demonstration on an average of twice each month for the previous 21 months. B-26 aircraft used by USAF Commandos in Vietnam were grounded 8 April 1964, following an official investigation into the 11 February accident. B-26 aircraft in use by the South Vietnamese Air Force were also grounded in accordance with the U.S. ruling.|$|E
25|$|AMC also {{produced}} a one-off Sportabout for Gucci's personal use. The car was {{powered by a}} 5-litre V8 engine and had a three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather was door panels, cargo area {{as well as the}} front and rear centre arm rests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, <b>pull-out</b> writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A map {{light at the end of}} a flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk, the left carried a vanity mirror, also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open. The one on the passenger's side served as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.|$|E
25|$|The turn is {{initiated}} by touching the wall during the gliding {{or during the}} recovery phase of the arms, {{depending on how the}} wall can be touched faster. After touching the wall, the legs are pulled underneath of the body. The body turns sideways while one hand is moved forward (i.e. towards the head) {{along the side of the}} body. When the body is almost completely turned, the other hand will be swung straight up through the air such that both hands meet at the front at the same time. At that time the body should also be almost in the horizontal and partially or totally submerged. After the body is completely submerged, the body is pushed off the wall with both legs. Doing this under water will reduce the drag. After a gliding phase, an underwater <b>pull-out</b> is done, followed by another gliding phase and then regular swimming. The head must break the surface during the second stroke.|$|E
