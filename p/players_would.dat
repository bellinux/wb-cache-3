5|$|The game's {{difficulty}} {{was designed}} {{with the intent}} that young and inexperienced <b>players</b> <b>would</b> be able to complete the game, while more experienced <b>players</b> <b>would</b> be compelled by the replay value.|$|E
5|$|In total, eight Virginia Tech <b>players</b> <b>would</b> {{be drafted}} that year, along with four Kansas players.|$|E
5|$|Many of the <b>players</b> <b>would</b> {{face each}} other again in future {{international}} contests. Henderson would play the Soviets in the 1974 Summit Series organized by the WHA. Eleven of the Soviet 1972 team <b>players</b> <b>would</b> play against the Montreal Canadiens in the December 31, 1975 game of the Super Series '76. Five players of Team Canada 1972 would play for Montreal (Awrey, Cournoyer, Dryden, Lapointe and Savard). Many of the <b>players</b> <b>would</b> also play in the 1976 Canada Cup, including Bobby Orr, making his first appearance against the Soviets as a professional. He had the missed the chance in the Super Series '76, also due to injury.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{double-cross}} strategy: {{faced with}} position 1, a novice <b>player</b> <b>would</b> create position 2 and lose. An experienced <b>player</b> <b>would</b> create position 3 and win.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the taping}} begins, the players draw numbers to {{determine}} their positions on stage. Play proceeds {{from left to right}} from the viewer's perspective: from the red player to yellow, then to blue, then back to red. The red <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin in round 1, the yellow <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin in round 2 and the blue/green <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin in round 3. From 1999 to 2003 when the format consisted of 4 rounds plus the major prize round, the red <b>player</b> <b>would</b> take the first spin in round 4.|$|R
5000|$|The game also {{featured}} a [...] "warp system" [...] {{that allowed the}} player to skip levels and gain bonus points. The warps were activated by a Breakout clone at the bottom-right of the screen, where there would be two- or three-digit numbers. The <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have to move the joystick until the number matched the number required to warp. For example, the red warp required the number 23, so the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> move the joystick to the right or left until the first digit matched 2, then the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> click the fire button, the Breakout ball would start moving, so the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> {{have to play the}} breakout while moving the joystick to the 3 at the same time. When the player finally entered the warp code, the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> be transported to a higher level.|$|R
5|$|Gandingan {{players can}} {{demonstrate}} different techniques {{dependent on the}} occasion. In formal kulintang performances, <b>players</b> <b>would</b> use all four gongs, but during some informal occasions, such as a playing style called apad and kulndet, <b>players</b> <b>would</b> use {{only three of the}} highest pitched gongs of the gandingan. And in instances such as gandingan contest, gandingan players may be assisted by two mulits (kulintang assistants) who would hold the gongs steadily in place as players ferociously demonstrate their virtuosity on the instrument.|$|E
5|$|After {{succumbing to}} {{financial}} pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid-1930s {{as a minor}} professional club. The Tigers competed {{for a total of}} eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers <b>players</b> <b>would</b> later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Armenia's {{participation}} in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in Istanbul in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess <b>players</b> <b>would</b> find it quite difficult to play in Baku.|$|E
25|$|The Guardians Secret Footballer {{columnist}} {{said that}} a gay <b>player</b> <b>would</b> be accepted in a typical dressing room, and instead said that the worry for any would-be gay <b>player</b> <b>would</b> be the abuse from the terraces.|$|R
50|$|In the ABC version, Red <b>Player</b> <b>would</b> start Round 1, Yellow <b>Player</b> <b>would</b> begin Round 2, Blue <b>Player</b> <b>would</b> {{commence}} Round 3, and so on. In the ABS-CBN version, Toss-Up Rounds, {{valued at}} P5,000, P10,000, and P15,000 respectively, are played. The winner of each toss-up gets {{to begin the}} next round (the person starting Round 2 is the winner of Round 1). In both versions, play passes from Red, to Yellow, to Blue, and back to Red.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, if {{a patron}} wished {{to place a}} full {{complete}} bet on 17, the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> call [...] "17 to the maximum". This bet would require a total of 40 chips or $40,000. To manually place the same wager, the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> need to bet: ...|$|R
5|$|Arriving {{during the}} summer were Norwegian duo Erik Nevland and Henning Berg, who signed from Viking and Blackburn Rovers respectively. Both <b>players</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} rejoin their old clubs, with Nevland rejoining Viking in 1999, and Berg going back to Blackburn in 2000.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the <b>players</b> <b>would</b> stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the <b>players</b> <b>would</b> smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{confirmed}} that <b>players</b> <b>would</b> reprise {{the role of}} Gordon Freeman, unlike the original Half-Life expansion packs, which all dealt with different characters. Valve decided to develop Episode One in-house, as opposed to working with outside contractors as with previous expansions, because the company was already comfortable with the technology and construction tools of Half-Life 2.|$|E
50|$|From 2004 to 2006, the flip-up puzzle {{was used}} to {{determine}} who would be in control. If the yellow player buzzed in with the correct answer, then the yellow <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin for round 1, the blue <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin in round 2 and the red <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have the first spin in round 3. Another flip-up puzzle would be used to determine who would be in control for round 4. Like the July 1996 - 1998 era, the red podium was reserved for the carry-over champion.|$|R

5|$|The {{characters}} in Speed Buggy {{would also be}} featured in a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, where <b>players</b> <b>would</b> race Speed Buggy and other buggies in a fictionalized version of Baja California. Speedy would also make cameo appearances in later cartoons, including Johnny Bravo, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Invader Zim, Animaniacs, South Park, and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so <b>players</b> <b>would</b> have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that <b>players</b> <b>would</b> sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Although RSV Lahn-Dill, {{eager to}} develop young <b>players,</b> <b>would</b> only let her {{play in the}} seconds, Dillmann caught the {{attention}} of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a top-notch 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team {{went on to win the}} European Championships in 2011. Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national team mate Gesche Schünemann. While Schünemann received endorsements and could train in the hall of RSV Lahn-Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the chamber}} chosen, the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> face a {{different}} set of challenges: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} also tiles that contained bombs which needed to be ejected from the playing field within a set time limit or the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> lose a life and need to restart the level. To remove these tiles from the board the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> slide them towards one of the holes that periodically appear in {{the sides of the}} playing area.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} format (which only lasted {{the first week}} of the series), the team was staked with $1 and had a 60-second time limit. Each correct {{response}} added one half of a zero behind the $1, meaning that after two correct responses the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> win $10, after four the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> win $100 and so on up to the $10,000 maximum.|$|R
5|$|An NBA player {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000. The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA <b>players</b> <b>would</b> be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and new players could disrupt the teams.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and <b>players</b> <b>would</b> {{have been able to do}} battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which <b>players</b> <b>would</b> have had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that <b>players</b> <b>would</b> have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5000|$|Roulette Dares: After lunch, {{the players}} were taken to a {{roulette}} table with four envelopes. Each envelope contained a task that only one <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have to complete.

5|$|As {{part of the}} game's early promotion, a {{scavenger}} hunt contest {{was announced}} {{in the last week}} of May 2009. <b>Players</b> <b>would</b> need to search for articles on specific game-related sites to find information on the bands that are to be in Guitar Hero 5, and then enter those bands at the game's official website for a chance to win a series of concert tickets in their area. Through this promotion, a large number of artists in the final track list were revealed.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest <b>players</b> <b>would</b> no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Enix remade Dragon Quest and Dragon QuestII for a one-cartridge {{compilation}} {{known as}} Dragon QuestI+II for the Super Famicom on December18, 1993. The remake sold over 1.2million copies in Japan. In 1998, Enix released BS Dragon Quest for the Super Famicom Satellaview extension exclusively in Japan. The latter consisted of four one-hour scenarios which <b>players</b> <b>would</b> download {{on a weekly}} schedule. Players were tasked with leveling their character, collecting medals and completing scenario-specific conditions with special events designed to occur under specific conditions in real-time.|$|E

50|$|In those quiz games, {{there could}} be up to four <b>players.</b> A <b>player</b> <b>would</b> then pick a sub-topic out of a {{collection}} concerning the relevant topic. During the gameplay a player is asked a question, provided with facts and clues and then has to pick one out of several multiple choice answers in a limited time to score points. The <b>player</b> <b>would</b> have three chances to get the question right. Upon running out of time, getting the answer wrong or choosing to show answer, the <b>player</b> <b>would</b> be shown the actual answer with no points scored. Upon completing all the questions, the <b>player's</b> score <b>would</b> be totaled. Getting a perfect score <b>would</b> grant the <b>player</b> a medal. If a player gets medals for all the sub-topics of the game topic, the player is awarded a trophy.|$|R
