All {{are made from}} fruit, <b>preserved</b> <b>by</b> <b>sugar</b> and thickened or gelled to some extent. To gel properly, sweet spreads must contain {{the right combination of}} fruit, pectin, acid and sugar. The fruit gives each spread its unique flavor and color. Fruit also supplies the water needed to dissolve the other ingredients and {{some or all of the}} pectin and acid. Good quality, flavorful fruits make the best sweet spreads...|$|E
40|$|Freezing inactivates the phosphorylating {{systems of}} {{isolated}} chloroplasts and mitochondria. Since electron transport is {{not affected by}} freezing of isolated spinach chloroplasts, breakdown of A TP synthesis is considered as an uncoupling effect. Uncoupling can be prevented {{by the addition of}} small amounts of glurnse, sucrose and raffinose to the chloroplast system. Oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria can also be <b>preserved</b> <b>by</b> <b>sugars.</b> The protective action of sugars on chloroplasts can be overcome by NaCI, KCI, MgCl$_{ 2 }$ and Na$_{ 2 }SO_{ 4 }$. lt is possible to establish a balance between the protective effects of sugars and the deleterious effects of salts over a wide range of concentrations. However, although salts promote uncoupling of photophosphorylation by freezing, washed chloroplasts are uncoupled also. Bovine albumin is also capable of protecting photophosphorylation, although to a much smaller extent than sugars. Cysteine and glutathione fail to protect the chloroplast system. For this reason, and since no oxidation of protein SH-groups due to freezing can be detected, the sulfhydryl-disulficle theory of frost injury is rejected. In order to examine whether the same events take place in isolated cell organelles and in whole cells, tracer experiments were performed with intact tissue. These experiments provide evidence that ATP synthesis is primarily damaged by freezing. On the basis of the observed results, a biochemical mechanismof frost injury and frost hardiness is discussecl...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Fumonisins are {{economically}} important mycotoxins which {{until recently}} {{were considered to}} originate from only a few Fusarium species. However recently a putative fumonisin gene cluster was discovered in two different Aspergillus niger strains followed by detection of an actual fumonisin B 2 (FB 2) production in four strains of this biotechnologically important workhorse. RESULTS: In the present study, a screening of 14 A. niger strains and 25 assumed fumonisin producing Fusarium strains from 6 species, showed that 12 out of 14 A. niger strains produced FB 2 and 23 of 25 Fusarium produced fumonisin. Five A. niger and five Fusarium spp. were incubated at six different temperatures from 15 - 42 C on Czapek Yeast Agar + 5 % salt or Potato Dextrose Agar. A. niger had the highest production of FB 2 at 25 - 30 C whereas Fusarium spp. had the maximal production of FB 1 and FB 2 at 20 - 25 C. Addition of 2. 5 - 5 % NaCl, or 10 - 20 % sucrose increased the FB 2 production of A. niger, whereas addition of glycerol reduced FB 2 production. All three water activity lowering solutes reduced the fumonisin production of the Fusarium species. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that the regulation of fumonisin production is very different in A. niger and Fusarium, and that food and feeds <b>preserved</b> <b>by</b> addition of <b>sugar</b> or salts may be good substrates for fumonisin B 2 production by A. niger...|$|R
