40|$|One of {{the serious}} {{problems}} is how to authenticate the passport document for its holder. &# 13; The major factor of this authenticity is the corresponding of the Passport's photo with its holder. Most&# 13; of the Passport document contains a holder's signature in addition, of course, to the full name. We&# 13; propose a firm authentication method by extracting some features for the original name of the holder&# 13; with the <b>passport</b> <b>number</b> and digest them in a form, by applying some techniques, that can be hidden&# 13; in the passport's photo. The modern method of issuing a passport now is by using a computer in fixing&# 13; the passport's photo (imaging). In using this method we could hide the invisible watermark which&# 13; contains the digest name and <b>passport</b> <b>number</b> inside the <b>passport's</b> photo. During the hidden process&# 13; there are many techniques {{could be applied to}} disguise any color difference appears during the hidden&# 13; process. After using this technique, it is very simple to use the computer in scanning and verifying,&# 13; at check point, that the passport's photo has been not replaced and that by comparing the invisible&# 13; watermark with the digest name of the holder and <b>passport</b> <b>number.</b> </font...|$|R
40|$|The {{prominent}} {{problem in}} passport authentication is to authenticate the passport document for its owner. The critical factor of this authentication procedure {{is to establish}} a correspondence between Passport's photo and its owner. A passport document contains holder details in supplement to the holder’s signature. We propose an authentication scheme by extracting some details of the holder including <b>passport</b> <b>number,</b> converting them into a watermark and digesting them in a form by applying some techniques that can be hidden in the passport's photo. The computers have revolutionized the passport authentication process by using the computer in fixing the passport photo on the passport document during the issuing of passport and also verifying the passport at checkpoint by scanning. During the issue of passport, a watermark can be created based on the details of the holder full name and <b>passport</b> <b>number</b> and it can be hidden in the passport photo using watermarking technique. With the help of this technique, during the passport verification process at the checkpoint, computer can be used in scanning the passport photo to check whether the passport photo has been replaced by comparing the invisible watermark hidden in the passport photo with the holder’s details including the full name and <b>passport</b> <b>number...</b>|$|R
