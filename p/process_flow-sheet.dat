Phase one of the uranium purification plant has a capacity to treat 3,000 tonnes of ore per day. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has developed an innovative, economically viable process for the recovery of low-grade uranium (less than 0.2%) from the Tummalapalle ore mine. As illustrated by Dr. A. K. Suri, Director of Materials Group, BARC, [...] "the main objective of making a techno-economically viable <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> is to reduce the number of stages of unit operations and conservations leachants(sic) by regeneration and recycle(sic) leading to minimisation of fresh water inventory as well as quantum(sic) of liquid effluent discharge for the most challenging low-grade uranium ore".|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{commercial}} simulation programmes {{are available to}} support process modelling. Generally {{one or more of}} these commercial tools will be used by a given operating company to underpin its modelling activity. In addition, many operating companies also maintain their own in-house software to allow for the modelling of niche applications not fully addressed by the commercial tools. Each simulation programme provides an environment which allows a <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> to be constructed and the process fluid thermodynamics to be incorporated. The CAPE-OPEN project formally identified such a modelling programme as a Process Modelling Environment (PME) with the requirement that users of a PME should be able to easily connect the PME with other modelling tools without the need to develop bespoke interfaces. To do this a PME would be provided with a CAPE-OPEN “plug” that would allow any CAPE-OPEN component to be added to the modelling environment.|$|E

The work will involve bench-scale and pilot-scale tests, using chelation-flotation, chemical leaching and ultrasonic leaching techniques, in conjunction with cross-flow microfiltration and filter-press operations. The effectiveness of an integrated process to treat leachates generated from soil processing will be demonstrated. <b>Process</b> <b>flow-sheets</b> suitable for in-situ and ex-situ applications will be developed and preliminary costs will be provided for the soil and leachate treatment technologies. In accordance with 10 CFR 600. 31 (d) (i), an extension of the project period including final report submission to 31 July 1995 was made in anticipation of potential delays in receiving Fernald soil samples at Chalk River Laboratories for the planned pilot-scale verification tests. Ex-situ pilot-scale soil decontamination and leachate treatment tests using Chalk River Chemical Pit soil are nearing completion. Soil decontamination tests using Fernald Incinerator Area soil originally scheduled for February 1995 was postponed to May 1995 as result of unexpected delays in the preparation of two drums of soils ({approximately} 416 kg) by FERMCO and paperwork required to arrange for export/import licenses...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} within the Swedish Skogskemi (“forest chemicals”) project funded by Vinnova and aiming at investigating promising and competitive options for biomass based production of chemical intermediates such as olefins, methanol and butanol. The present report documents {{the contribution of}} Matteo Morandin to project work package on biomass gasification routes for methanol production and in particular focuses on mass and energy balances of three process concepts based on different gasification and gas cleaning technologies. In addition, the report discusses process integration opportunities for the biorefinery processes with industrial plants, such as the Stenungsund chemical cluster and the Värö and Iggesund pulp and paper mills, {{all of which were}} actively involved in the Skogskemi project. The characteristics of the three processes (gasification technology, location, size) were decided ex ante based on preliminary economic considerations such as maturity of technology and economy of scale aspects and represent an input to this work. The complete process layouts for the three plants were put together based on typical arrangements suggested in the literature for similar processes and on established engineering principles. The mass and energy balances of the three <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheets</b> were estimated with the help of Aspen plus and process models partially or completely available in the literature and partially developed at the Division of Industrial Energy Systems and Technologies, Chalmers. Following a rather common approach for preliminary design of chemical processes, the heating or cooling required to carry out the various thermochemical conversions from biomass to methanol were modelled as heaters and coolers. This allowed applying an energy targeting approach, Pinch Analysis, to estimate ideal heat recovery opportunities for the biomass based processes. As a result of the heat recovery analysis, the net heat available from the biomass based conversion processes (target) was obtained. Different opportunities for either exporting this heat to partially or fully replacing the steam deficit of the nearby industrial plants or for power generation by means of a heat recovery steam cycles are discussed. The thermodynamic performances of the three plants are then compared considering the combined effects of the material conversion from biomass to methanol and the fossil fuel savings in marginal heat and electricity producers {{as a consequence of the}} new heat and power balances at the industrial site once the biomass based processes are in place. Significant process synthesis and design variables are finally discussed and recommendations are provided for further investigations...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{has been}} widely used many years ago by {{chemical}} engineers to represent several processes and operations, existing in industries of chemical engineering interest. Flow-sheeting calculations {{is a kind of}} simulation for preliminary evaluation of different <b>processes.</b> <b>Flow-sheet</b> itself is a key document for the evaluation, design and analysis of processing systems. It shows the processing units arrangement and the streams connecting them, the quantities and compositions at every point of the flow-sheet and the operating conditions (phase, temperature, pressure, enthalpy etc.). Manual flow-sheeting calculations are tedious and time consuming, especially for large and complex flow-sheets. Special computer programs, which simulate different processing units existing in industries, are widely used in order to carry out these calculations, which are necessary for processes design. The designer engineer is possible to use these programs in order to evaluate existing processing units, to take into consideration different alternative solutions and to find out the optimum and more economic operating conditions. The main object of the present work was the development of a new, user friendly, steady state simulation computer program, to perform mass and energy balance calculations in flow-sheets mainly for industries processing agricultural products, using the method of separate calculation subroutines (modules). This program works in Microsoft Windows environment. This work was a trial to solve a problem for the case of industries processing agricultural products where, the lack of sufficient and adequate physical properties data for almost all agricultural products – especially due to changes in compositions during processing – makes the whole problem more complicated and the necessity of computer aided calculation more imperative. So, it was necessary to develop a special data bank for the physical properties of several agricultural products and chemical compounds as well. The use of this data bank is based on a model, which considers that the majority of processed agricultural products exist either as soluble solids or insoluble solids in water, or in some cases as liquids, where no phase change takes place during processing. By this way, processes where there are changes in concentrations of soluble or suspended solids (such as evaporations, dilutions etc.), are calculated easily. A set of selected and combined mathematical models simulating many types of unit operations in plants processing agricultural products in actual production conditions were used. Also a special data bank for the physical properties of several agricultural products and chemical compounds as well was developed, collecting or calculating data from several handbooks. The selection and formulation of the appropriate mathematical models as well as the selection or calculation of the appropriate physical properties of several agricultural products and chemical compounds were mainly the results of documentary analysis. The computer program developed using these models, was tested in actual production conditions. Most of them are cases existing in industries processing agricultural products. But also there are cases for other types of industries, which have been tested too. The obtained results in all cases are satisfactory, and they are in agreement with figures existing in actual plants or described in many references. Program presentation is mainly concentrated in its organization, the required input data, the used techniques and the obtained results in some test applications...|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Gas Technology has derived and {{developed}} a hybrid thermochemical water-splitting cycle based on mixed copper oxides and copper sulfate. Similar to other metal oxide-metal sulfate cycles that use a metal oxide to 'concentrate' electrolytically produced sulfuric acid, this cycle offers the advantage of producing oxygen (to be vented) and sulfur dioxide (to be recycled) in separate steps, thereby eliminating the need of another step to separate these gases. The conceptual <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> efficiency of the cycle promises to exceed 50 %. It has been completely demonstrated in the laboratory with recycled materials.

40|$|Solvent {{extraction}} {{is considered}} as a multi-criteria optimization problem, since several chemical species with similar extraction kinetic properties are frequently present in the aqueous phase and the selective extraction is not practicable. This optimization, applied to mixer–settler units, considers the best parameters and operating conditions, {{as well as the}} best structure or <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet.</b> Global process optimization is performed for a specific flow-sheet and a comparison of Pareto curves for different flow-sheets is made. The positive weight sum approach linked to the sequential quadratic programming method is used to obtain the Pareto set. In all investigated structures, recovery increases with hold-up, residence time and agitation speed, while the purity has an opposite behaviour. For the same treatment capacity, counter-current arrangements are shown to promote recovery without significant impairment in purity. Recycling the aqueous phase is shown to be irrelevant, but organic recycling with as many stages as economically feasible clearly improves the design criteria and reduces the most efficient organic flow-rate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUranium metal {{used for}} {{fabrication}} of fuel for research reactors in India is generally produced by magnesio-thermic reduction of UF 4. Performance of magnesio-thermic reaction and recovery {{and quality of}} uranium largely depends on properties of UF 4. As ammonium diuranate (ADU) is first product in powder form in the <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet,</b> properties of UF 4 depend on properties of ADU. ADU is generally produced from uranyl nitrate solution (UNS) for natural uranium metal production and from uranyl fluoride solution (UFS) for low enriched uranium metal production. In present paper, ADU has been produced via both the routes. Variation of uranium recovery and crystal structure and composition of ADU with progress in precipitation reaction has been studied with special attention on first appearance of the precipitate Further, ADU produced by two routes have been calcined to UO 3, then reduced to UO 2 and hydroflorinated to UF 4.

The first centrifuge experiment was run with spiked solutions while in the second a genuine actinide/lanthanide fraction from a TODGA process was used. Three different flow rates were tested with each set-up. the results show that even with low flow rates, only around 9 % of the equilibrium D-ratio (Am) was reached for the extraction in the spiked test and around 16 % in the hot test (the difference is due {{to the size of the}} centrifuges). In the hot test the lanthanide scrubbing was inefficient whereas in the stripping both the actinides and the lanthanides showed good results.

The Visual Desalination and Simulation (VDS) package, developed by authors [2], is used as a tool of analysis. The results are compared with the basic 5000 m 3 /day MSF configuration of Eoun Mousa (Egypt), [3]. An MSF <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> is developed of basic MSF desalination plant with interstage re-heater(s).

In this strategy, a solvent comprising the TODGA extractant with addition of 5 vol. -% 1 -octanol showed very good extraction efficiency of Am(III) and Cm(III) together with the trivalent lanthanides (Ln(III)) from simulated PUREX raffinate solution without 3 rd phase formation. CDTA (cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid) was used as masking agent to prevent the co-extraction of Zr and Pd. An(III) and Ln(III) were co-extracted from simulated PUREX raffinate, and the loaded solvent was subjected to several stripping steps. The An(III) were selectively stripped using the hydrophilic complexing agent SO 3 -Ph-BTP (2, 6 -bis(5, 6 -di(sulfophenyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazin- 3 -yl) pyridine). For the subsequent stripping of the Ln(III), a citric acid based solution was used. A 32 -stage <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> was designed using computer-code calculations and tested in annular miniature centrifugal contactors in counter-current mode. The innovative SANEX process showed excellent performance for the recovery of An(III) from simulated HAR solution and separation from the fission and activation products. ≥ 99. 8 % An(III) were recovered with only low impurities (0. 4 % Ru, 0. 3 % Sr, 0. 1 % Ln(III)). The separation from the Ln(III) was excellent and the Ln(III) were efficiently stripped by the citrate-based stripping solution. The only major contaminant in the spent solvent was Ru, with 14. 7 % of the initial amount being found in the spent solvent. Solvent cleaning and recycling therefore has to be further investigated. This successful spiked test demonstrated the possibility of separating An(III) directly from HAR solution in a single cycle {{which is a great}} improvement over the former multi-cycle strategy.

40|$|This work {{follows a}} {{feasibility}} study (187) which {{suggested that a}} process for purifying wet-process phosphoric acid by solvent extraction should be economically viable. The work was divided into two main areas, (i) chemical and physical measurements on the three-phase system, with or without impurities; (ii) process simulation and optimization. The object was to test the process technically and economically and to optimise the type of solvent. The chemical equilibria and distribution curves for the system water - phosphoric acid - solvent for the solvents n-amyl alcohol, tri-n-butyl phosphate, di-isopropyl ether and methyl isobutyl ketone have been determined. Both pure phosphoric acid and acid containing known amounts of naturally occurring impurities (Fe P 0 4, A 1 P 0 4, Ca 3 (P 04) Z and Mg 3 (P 0 4) Z) were examined. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the systems were also studied. The experimental results obtained for drop size distribution were compared with those obtainable from Hinze's equation (32) and {{it was found that}} they deviated by an amount related to the turbulence. A comprehensive literature survey on the purification of wet-process phosphoric acid by organic solvents has been made. The literature regarding solvent extraction fundamentals and equipment and optimization methods for the envisaged process was also reviewed. A modified form of the Kremser-Brown and Souders equation to calculate the number of contact stages was derived. The modification takes into account the special nature of phosphoric acid distribution curves in the studied systems. The <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> was developed and simulated.

40|$|A {{number of}} CO₂ capture-enabled power {{generation}} technologies {{have been proposed}} to address the negative environmental impact of CO₂ emission. An important barrier to adopting these technologies is the associated energy and economic penalties. Chemical-looping (CLC) is an oxycombustion technology that can significantly lower such penalties, utilizing a redox process to {{eliminate the need for}} an air separation unit and enable better energy integration. Conventional CLC employs two separate reactors, with metal oxide particles circulating pneumatically in-between, leading to significant irreversibility associated with reactor temperature difference. A rotary reactor, on the other hand, maintains near-thermal equilibrium between the two stages by thermally coupling channels undergoing oxidation and reduction. In this thesis, a multiscale analysis for assessing the integration of the rotary CLC reactor technology in power generation systems is presented. This approach employs a sequence of models that successively increase the resolution of the rotary reactor representation, ranging from interacting thermal reservoirs to higher fidelity quasi-steady state models, in order to assess the efficiency potential and perform a robust optimization of the integrated system. Analytical thermodynamic availability and ideal cycles are used to demonstrate the positive impact of reactor thermal coupling on system efficiency. Next, detailed <b>process</b> <b>flow-sheet</b> models in which the rotary reactor is modeled as a set of interacting equilibrium reactors are used to validate the analytical model results, identify best cycle configurations and perform preliminary parametric analysis for between the reactor and the system while maintaining computational efficiency, an intermediate fidelity model is developed, retaining finite rate surface kinetics and internal heat transfer within the reactor. This model is integrated with a detailed system model and used for optimization, parametric analysis and characterization of the relative techno-economic performance of different oxygen carrier options for thermal plants integrated with the rotary CLC reactor. Results show that thermal coupling in the redox process increases the efficiency by up to 2 % points for combined, recuperative and hybrid cycles. The studies also show that the thermal efficiency {{is a function of the}} reactor purge steam demand, which depends on the reactivity of the oxygen carrier. While purge steam constitutes a monotonic parasitic loss for the combined cycle, for recuperative and hybrid cycles, it raises the efficiency as long as the steam demand is less than a threshold value. This relationship between reactivity and system efficiency provides a useful selection criteria for the oxygen carrier material. Optimization results based on efficiency and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) identify nickel-based oxygen carriers as the most suitable for the rotary reactor because its high reactivity ensures low steam demand and reactor cost. Compared to nickel, maximum efficiency and minimum LCOE are respectively 7 % lower and 40 % higher for a copper-based system; iron-based systems have 4 % higher maximum efficiency and 7 % higher minimum LCOE. This study also showed that optimal efficiency generally has an inverse profile to that for the optimized LCOE. by Chukwunwike Ogbonnia Iloeje. Thesis: Ph.
