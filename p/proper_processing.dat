The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, <b>proper</b> <b>processing</b> (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. Nitrate film was replaced with acetate-base films. These Cellulose acetate films were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by polyester film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than nitrate- and acetate-base films.|$|E

50|$|The 3' to 5' human type {{endonuclease}} {{is known}} to be essential for the <b>proper</b> <b>processing</b> of histone pre-mRNA, in which U7 snRNP directs the single cleavage process. Following the removal of the downstream cleavage product (DCP) 5' to 3' exonuclease continues to further breakdown the product until it is completely degraded. This allows the nucleotides to be recycled. 5' To 3' exonuclease is linked to a co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC) activity that acts as a precursor to develop a free 5' unprotected end, so the exonuclease can remove and degrade the downstream cleavage product (DCP). This initiates transcriptional termination because one does not want DNA or RNA strands building up in their bodies.|$|E

50|$|QDPR (quinoid dihydropteridine reductase) {{is a human}} {{gene that}} {{produces}} the enzyme quinoid dihydropteridine reductase. This enzyme {{is part of the}} pathway that recycles a substance called tetrahydrobiopterin, also known as BH4. Tetrahydrobiopterin works with an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase to process a substance called phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid (a building block of proteins) that is obtained through the diet; it is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. When tetrahydrobiopterin interacts with phenylalanine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin is altered and must be recycled to a usable form. The regeneration of this substance is critical for the <b>proper</b> <b>processing</b> of several other amino acids in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin also helps produce certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells.|$|E
50|$|The microRNAs thus {{generated}} {{are short}} RNA molecules that regulate {{a wide variety}} of other genes by interacting with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to induce cleavage of complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) as part of the RNA interference pathway. A microRNA molecule is synthesized as a long RNA primary transcript known as a pri-miRNA, which is cleaved by Drosha to produce a characteristic stem-loop structure of about 70 base pairs long, known as a pre-miRNA. Drosha exists as part of a protein complex called the Microprocessor complex, which also contains the double-stranded RNA binding protein Pasha (also called DGCR8). Pasha is essential for Drosha activity and is capable of binding single-stranded fragments of the pri-miRNA that are required for <b>proper</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unlike most vitamins, {{which are}} noncovalently bound to enzymes, biotin is {{chemically}} linked (covalently bound), and therefore cannot be easily {{removed from the}} enzyme denaturation. Without biotinidase activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot {{be used by the}} body. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the BTD gene. When biotinidase activity is deficient, biotin can be neither recycled within the body nor removed from ingested food. Nor can biotin be recycled from enzymes to which it is bound. Deficient biotinidase activity causes specific metabolic enzymes, called carboxylases, to be nonfunctional, inhibiting the <b>proper</b> <b>processing</b> of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Individuals lacking biotinidase activity can still have normal carboxylases if they ingest small amounts of biotin.Approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns are affected by profound (less than 10 percent of normal enzyme activity) or partial (10-30 percent of normal enzyme activity) biotinidase deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Echoic memory {{represents}} SM for {{the auditory}} sense of hearing. Auditory information travels as sound waves which are sensed by hair {{cells in the}} ears. Information is sent to and processed in the temporal lobe. The echoic sensory store holds information for 2-3 seconds to allow for <b>proper</b> <b>processing.</b> The first studies of echoic memory came shortly after Sperling investigated iconic memory using an adapted partial report paradigm. Today, characteristics of echoic memory have been found mainly using a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm which utilizes EEG and MEG recordings. MMN {{has been used to}} identify some of the key roles of echoic memory such as change detection and language acquisition. Change detection, or the ability to detect an unusual or possibly dangerous change in the environment independent of attention, is key to the survival of an organism. With regards to language, a characteristic of children who begin speaking late in development is reduced duration of echoic memory. In short, [...] "Echoic memory is a fast-decaying store of auditory information." [...] In the case of damage to or lesions developing on the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, or hippocampus, echoic memory will likely be shortened and/or have a slower reaction time.|$|E
50|$|By 1942, the Selective Service System {{moved away}} from {{administrative}} selection by its more than 6,000 local boards {{to a system of}} lottery selection. Rather than filling quotas by local selection, the boards now ensured <b>proper</b> <b>processing</b> of men selected by the national lottery. On December 5, 1942, presidential Executive Order 9279 made it so that men from the ages of 18 to 37 could not voluntarily enlist even if they had not been drafted, providing protection for the nation's home front manpower pool. Paul V. McNutt, head of the War Manpower Commission, estimated that the changes would increase the ratio of men drafted from one out of nine to one out of five. The commission's goal was to have nine million men in the armed forces by the end of 1943. This facilitated the massive requirement of up to 200,000 men per month and would remain the standard for the length of the war. The World War II draft operated from 1940 until 1947 when its legislative authorization expired without further extension by Congress. During this time, more than 10 million men had been inducted into military service. With the expiration, no inductions occurred in 1947. However, the SSS remained intact.|$|E
