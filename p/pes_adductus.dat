40|$|Controversy as to {{the best}} {{treatment}} of congenital clubfoot has been present since first mentioned by Hippocrates more than two millennias ago. We evaluated 23 children with 33 clubfoot which has been treated by dorsomedial release. The average age at Follow-Up was 64 months. Children in the control-group were without congenital footdeformities. We performed pedobarographic analysis of the foot {{in addition to the}} clinical study. Peakpressures showed significant differences under the hindfoot (lower), under the first metatarsal bone (lower) and under the midfoot (higher) which can be explained by undercorrection of pes equinus and pes supinatus as well as overcorrection of pes excavatus. Analysis of the adductionangle showed persisting <b>pes</b> <b>adductus</b> in 42 %. Clinical analysis showed good or excellent results in only {{about a quarter of the}} patients. The results of this study have to lead to a new discussion about the need of extensive operative treatment in congenital clubfoot...|$|E
