40|$|Harnessing {{energy at}} micro-scale from high energy sources has gained {{significance}} {{in recent times}} for space propulsion and other applications. Conventional solid rocket propellants have advantages {{in terms of being}} efficient, compact and safe to handle, though with much lower regression rates as compared to solid explosives. An approach to high regression rates in composite propellants is demonstrated in the present work by the enhancement of fuel-oxidiser interaction, and by the incorporation of micro-scale porosity into the propellant grain. The porous polystyrene-ammonium perchlorate grain designed in this work, based on electrospun micro-fibres and aqueous impregnation, exhibits burning rates more than 25 times as compared to the non-porous grain. Such high regression rates using insensitive propellant compositions have practical implications in the development of micro-thrusters, and in gas generating devices such as MAV launch systems and turbine starters.

Then, a plate-like structure forms by extending the lowest surface energy crystal facet, { 111 }. Furthermore, the ions from dissolved particles would contribute {{to the growth of}} the prisms. Therefore, the formation of the silver nanoprisms could involve both coalescence and dissolution-recrystallization processes. Recently, Grouchko et al. reported the coalescence process that was induced by the self-assembly of silver nanoparticles to form 3 D dendrites [20], which occurred during the evaporation of silver nanoparticles dispersion. They demonstrated that the f.c.c. structure particle could convert to h.c.p. structure via coalescence process by using in situ high-resolution TEM. The reorganization of nanoparticles into other nanostructures could occur in metal nanoparticles and also in semiconductors [28 – 32]. Mirkin et al. reported a bimodal distribution in the photochemical <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> for nanoprisms. In their study, since the large prisms (150 ± 16 nm) have an edge length approximately twice of the small prism (70 ± 12 nm), they proposed the formation through cluster fusion processes, where four small prisms could fuse and form one large prism [24]. Similarly, silver nanobelts have been prepared through thermal transformation from silver nanoprisms [11]. Therefore, both spherical and triangular nanoparticles can serve as building blocks in the fusion process. Our proposed mechanism differs from others who suggested that the formation of nanoprism is caused by point initiated growth [14 – 17].|$|E

Through this <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure,</b> arterial switch was achieved in 82 cases (76. 6 %) with satisfactory results. However, among the 107, 14 cases were converted to the Senning track for various reasons. Acute left ventricular hypertrophy by pressure overload provided expected systolic left ventricular function in most infants though some limitations were invariably encountered. Adequate preparedness of left ventricle was best assessed with combined left ventricular to right ventricular systolic pressure ratio (LVp/RVp) equal or greater than 0. 8 and the diastolic posterior wall thickness of left ventricle (LVPWT) equal or greater than 4. 0 mm. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was predominantly influenced by pre-load and was not sensitive to acquisition of systolic function unless corrected by left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVM/LVEDV). Although this two-stage approach to simple transposition is transitional toward neonatal, primary Jatene operation and the clinical prevalence of this two-stage approach will decline with advances in neonatal cardiac surgery, this new concept of "left ventricular training" has not only changed the surgical strategy for simple transposition but also has the strong impact on strategies for use of left ventricle as a systemic chamber in other complex congenital cardiac anomalies with low pressure left ventricle...|$|E

The aim of the study evaluates the effects of a <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> using an animated informative video on post-surgical pain responses after third molar extraction on youths during the postoperative follow-up. METHODS: 140 patients undergoing third molar extraction were randomly divided into two groups: control (CG) and experimental (EG). For pain assessment, the short-form McGill pain questionnaire was given once before the procedure and four times after the surgery, and the amount of postoperative analgesic consumption was recorded. The informative video was presented to the EG after the first assessment. For data analysis, ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0. 05) were used. Data analysis indicated that the EG patients reported reduced pain perception for all pain indexes. RESULTS: Significant between-group differences were observed for Sensory and Affective Rank Pain Indexes (PRI-S and PRI-A, respectively), as well as for Global Assessment, at stages 2, 3 and 4 (p= 0. 0001; p= 0. 0027; p= 0. 0001). For Present Pain Intensity, a significant difference between groups was observed (p= 0. 0004) at stages 3, 4 and 5.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} reported was to study the reaction of non-necrotic myocardium to a right ventricular infarct produced by right coronary ligation in the rat. Samples {{were taken from the}} right ventricle to investigate the reaction in the marginal zone of the infarct, and from the left ventricle to observe the changes in the cardiac muscle remote from the necrosis. Sham operations were performed in order to investigate the effect of the operative trauma. The evolution of findings in the left ventricular myocardium was correlated in time with the known post-operative increase of myocardial resistance, in an effort to find the possible myocardial factors responsible for this increase. Cardiac muscle cells in the marginal zone and some of the subepicardial muscle cells displayed a variety of histochemical and electron microscopic changes suggestive of an impairment of the cellular function and an increased importance of alternative metabolic pathways, in order to preserve the structural integrity of the cells and to meet their energy requirements. The findings in this area were apparently related to the progressive anoxia which resulted from the fibrotic transformation of granulation tissue surrounding the infarct. Biochemical, histochemical and electron microscopic studies of the left ventricular myocardium remote from necrosis suggested that the <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> resulted in a temporary stimulation of the proteosynthetic activity in the cardiac muscle cells and that this may form the basis for their increased resistance and adaptability.

30|$|This {{classification}} {{system does not}} mention the method of closure of the vaginal vault in a separate type or subtype, {{making it difficult to}} audit complication rates of vault dehiscence and hematoma formation, which may be related to vaginal or laparoscopic suturing. Being more complete than the system proposed by Johns and Diamonds [20], it also includes steps which may be of importance to know if they were performed vaginally or laparoscopically, such as the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, as complications can be related to excessive fulguration or inappropriate suspension. Garry proposed a descriptive approach, which seems appealing due to simplicity and clear distinction. This was achieved by not using a numerical approach but rather describing the primary and if likely the secondary operations. Being simple to reproduce, this system has the drawback of not exactly defining the anatomical landmarks of the operation, which by themselves will promote standardization of the technique and make easier the way we evaluate our operations and audit our results. It seems more reasonable therefore that a simple descriptive approach, incorporating the surgical anatomy and defining the method of vault closure, will serve the above purposes. It also appears that a diagnostic laparoscopy, which has been classified as stage 0 [20], or a <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> (type 0 by Munro) [19], does not contribute to the actual description of the hysterectomy and can be documented separately in order to explain comorbidities such as adhesions and endometriosis.

Patients were treated {{in two different}} centers, University Hospital St. Rafaël in Leuven and Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, where different techniques and procedures were used. Measurements were performed on 341 portal films and entrance doses were measured in 518 treatment set-ups. The impact of systematic errors occurring during treatment preparation and day-to-day variations on the accuracy of treatment execution were separately analysed. Daily reproducibility, defined as the deviation from the respective mean measured value for a treatment was demonstrated {{to be good for}} both the treated volume and the delivered dose and no difference between the two techniques was shown. Comparing the successive portal films of individual patients (reproducibility of a treatment, once it has started), only small day-to-day variations are found: the SD is 3. 4 mm for craniocaudal movements and 2. 6 mm for lateral movements. For dose delivery very narrow distributions are obtained with SDs of, respectively, 1. 5 % and 1. 85 % for the Leuven and the Villejuif group. This suggests that the position of the patient, which is often thought as the critical point in this complex set-up can be done in a very accurate way, regardless of the position used.

Most of our basic concepts of cellular and tissue structure rest squarely on these methods of preservation. The original uses for which chemical fixation were intended were entirely morphological and for this purpose they have served faithfully for over one hundred years. The increasing use of histo-chemical methods has made increasingly severe demands on these fixatives. The role of the chemical fixative {{continues to be an}} important one, however, because of the ease with which it can be used and because of the insolubility which can be conferred on the particular class of compounds of interest. In the case of quantitative measurements of nucleo-proteins in the cell, a further advantage of chemi-cal fixation {{lies in the fact that}} non-wanted substances can be removed (18) so that their unwanted effects on the optical or staining prop-erties of the preparations are eliminated.

40|$|ObjectiveAutogenous vein {{bypasses}} are {{a common}} and effective method to treat occlusive disease. During surgical preparation, veins are routinely pressure distended to overcome vasospasm and twists. Distention, however, is believed to promote vascular remodeling and contribute to decreased graft patency. Pharmacologic vasorelaxation {{with a combination of}} effective vasodilators has been suggested as an alternative to pressure distention. The extracellular matrix (ECM) -degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in vascular remodeling and neointima formation. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to compare the effects of pressure distention with pharmacologic vasorelaxation on graft remodeling and regulation of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in porcine vein grafts. MethodsCarotid artery bypass utilizing internal jugular veins was performed in eight female white pigs. Jugular veins were randomized to receive pressure distention (300 mm Hg for 2 minutes) or a combination of vasodilators (the α-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, 10 μmol/L; the Rho-kinase inhibitor HA- 1077 [fasudil], 50 μmol/L; and the calcium-channel blocker nicardipine, 1 μmol/L) for 30 minutes and then were grafted into the carotid arteries. Two weeks after surgery, vein graft samples were analyzed for vessel intimal and medial area, lumen diameter, and ECM composition. Molecular analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western immunoblotting, gelatin zymography, and reverse zymography were performed to study the expression and activation of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) - 1 and TIMP- 2. ResultsPressure distention irreversibly overstretched the porcine jugular vein and increased MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 proteolytic activity by 40 % and 77 %, respectively. Two weeks of vein grafting in the carotid arterial bed induced vessel wall thickening, ECM modification, and neointima formation, which were more pronounced in the distended grafts (P <. 05) and accompanied by an increase in MMP expression and activity. Distended grafts demonstrated higher percentages of active MMP- 9 (17. 8 % ± 1. 0 %) and higher activities of latent (35. 5 % ± 3. 3 %) and active MMP- 2 (69. 6 % ± 8. 8 %) than the pharmacologically treated grafts. Protein expression of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 was downregulated after arterial grafting, but the pharmacologically treated grafts expressed significantly more TIMP- 1 protein (by 36. 8 % ± 4. 1 %) than the distended ones. The activities of TIMPs were markedly decreased after grafting, contributing to the upregulated MMP activity. ConclusionsPressure distention of vein grafts before implantation, compared with pharmacologic vasodilatation, stimulates neointima formation and augments MMP activities. Pharmacologic vasorelaxation may be clinically superior to distention in attenuating graft remodeling and possibly improving graft patency. Clinical RelevanceAutogenous vein bypasses {{are a common}} and effective method to treat occlusive disease. This study demonstrated that pressure distention, a common <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> in bypass surgery, upregulates extracellular matrix-degrading matrix metalloproteinases, which predisposes vein grafts to extensive remodeling and contributes to neointima formation and graft occlusion. The topical application of a combination of vasodilators to the vein graft before implantation may be clinically superior to pressure distention in attenuating graft remodeling and may possibly improve graft patency and reduce secondary surgical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{beneficial}} properties of hydrogels as artificial cell culture supports have been extensively investigated. Certain synthetic hydrogels have been proposed to be similar in composition and structure to the native extracellular matrix of the stem cell niche, their in vivo cell habitat, which is a powerful component in controlling stem cell fate. The stem cell differentiation pathway taken is influenced by many factors. When culturing cells within or upon hydrogels the choice can be strongly dependent on the underlying 3 D hydrogel chemistry which strongly influences hydrogel-cell interactions. The interrelationship between hydrogel chemistry and that of biomolecules in controlling cellular response ideally requires analysis methods to characterise the chemistry without labels and normally in 3 D. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF SIMS) {{has the potential to}} be utilised for through thickness characterisation of hydrogels. The frozen-hydrated sample format is well suited to minimise changes associated with dehydration or the complication of chemical ‘fixation’. There is however significant challenges associated with this sample format. Frost formation occurs on cold samples in the ambient atmosphere affecting the quality of chemical information acquired from depth profiling frozen hydrogel samples. We develop a simple method to remove this frost by blowing with gas prior to entry into the instrument which is shown to produce remarkably good profiles on a poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) hydrogel film where a model protein, lysozyme, is incorporated to demonstrated how biomolecule distribution within hydrogels can be determined. A comparison of lysozyme incorporation is made between the situation where the protein is present in the polymer dip coating solution and lysozyme is a component of the incubation medium. It is shown that protonated water clusters H(H 2 O) n+ where n= 5 - 11 that are indicative of ice are detected through the entire thickness of the pHEMA and the lysozyme distribution through the pHEMA hydrogel films can be determined using the intensity of characteristic fragment secondary ions. Quantitative TOF-SIMS analysis is highly desirable in biomaterial analysis as the amount and type of molecule in the material analysed may be determined. This has significant interest in hydrogel chemical analysis as cellular development on or within hydrogels may be highly influenced by the concentration and type of soluble molecule. Unfortunately, the matrix effect in SIMS changes the measured signal intensity of the analyte, preventing accurate quantitation. For this reason, we apply X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) on the equivalent samples as the ToF-SIMS in an attempt to correlate molecular ion yields to exact elemental concentrations. Similarly to ToF-SIMS the frozen-hydrated format in XPS is however still relatively unexplored. We apply the developed <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedure</b> in 3 D XPS analysis of pHEMA/lysozyme hydrogel films in a hydrated state. We show that this format is suitable for alternative high vacuum analysis techniques. Furthermore, we show that lysozyme ingression and concentration can be determined through XPS. This work describes the first example of the characterisation of a hydrogel by ToF-SIMS and XPS in a frozen hydrated format, characterising hydrogels in a format most reflecting its native hydrated state at culture conditions. The described procedure allows for the mapping of biomolecules in a label free manner in 3 D, furthermore allowing quantitative determination of biomolecule concentrations in hydrogels...|$|E

Thick filaments were present in approximately equal numbers in vascular smooth muscle relaxed by theophylline, in Ca++free solution, or contracted by norepinephrine. The same <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedures</b> used with vascular smooth muscle also enabled us to visualize thick filaments in guinea pig and rabbit taenia coli and vas deferens. Thick filaments in vertebrate smooth muscle have been observed in only a relatively few studie...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a student nurse project carried out on a {{community}} placement in respect to patients dependent on medical devices {{in the event of}} power cuts. The project was designed to identify relevant literature to establish what emergency and <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedures</b> and protocols are in place in a PCT Trust for this type of emergency and to identify what action a nurse in the community should take to ensure the safety and welfare of their patients if a there was a prolonged power failure. The literature and knowledge of community staff for the correct procedures to follow {{in the event of a}} power cut in the community established that there was some cause for concern and identified that a loss of power to a patient with a medical device poses a serious risk. Recommendations are that an initial risk assessment of power failure needs to be undertaken and included in the appropriate documentation and guidance plans prepared for community staff and should include the listing of the patient as vulnerable. The limited research identified within this project also indicates that contingency plans to ensure the safety and wellbeing of patients in the community clearly need to be included in disaster and emergency planning...|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{monitoring}} of Pharmaceutical products {{is necessary to}} ensure its safety and efficacy throughout all phases of the drug. A systematic approach should be adapted to the presentation and evaluation of stable information, which should include, as necessary, physical, chemical, biological and microbiological test characteristics. Indian System of Medicine (ISM) frequently uses metal/mineral drugs. It is mandatory to standardize the <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedures.</b> For the Pharmaceutical standardization, three batches of the Panchavaktra ras were prepared and analytical study of final product carried out. Panchavaktra ras consist equal parts of Parada (Mercury), Gandhaka (Sulphur), Tankana (Borax) Pippali (Piper longum L.) and Marica (Piper nigrum L.), and Mardhana (Grinding) was done carefully with sufficient quantity of juice of Datura metel leaves for 24 hours and a final product was obtained {{in the form of}} Vati (tablet) form. It is one of the formulations mentioned in Amavata (Rheumatoid Arthritis) disease. The final products were subjected to Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) studies and values of XRD peaks of particular Panchavaktra ras were observed. This study revealed that high peaks of HgS (Metacinnabar), free S (Sulfur), Chabazite (Ca- exchanged), dehydrated Ca (structure- Rhombohedral) in the final products. The structural and chemical characterization of the HgS (Metacinnabar) found as cubic, free S (Sulphur) as Orthorhombic in all the samples. The 50 % strongest peaks of HgS were present at 2 -Theta scal...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} April-June 2011, we bid {{farewell}} to the former Executive Secretary of the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) Dr. Tom Okurut and welcomed Dr. Canisius Kanangire who commenced his ﬁ ve-year tenure of duty in June 2011. In this issue, Dr. Kanangire summarises his vision to scale-up the Commission’s achievements during the next ﬁ ve years. One of the biggest achievements during the last quarter was {{the signing of the}} Grant Protocol of Agreement between the East African Community (EAC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) as well as the subsequent signing of Subsidiary Grant Transfer Agreements between the EAC Secretariat and each of the ﬁ ve Partner States to commence the implementation of the physical infrastructural works for the Lake Victoria Water Supply and Sanitation (LVWATSAN) Programme Phase II. The details of this landmark project are part and parcel of this Issue. The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project Phase II (LVEMP II) was also blessed with the coming on board of the Republic of Burundi and the Republic of Rwanda after completing the necessary <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedures.</b> We bring you summary information on this progress. Finally, management has introduced a “Partners Forum” to allow all institutions and stakeholders working towards the sustainable development agenda of the Lake Victoria Basin to make contributions to this newsletter.

40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that motion sickness affects thermoregulatory responses to cooling in humans. Ten healthy male volunteers underwent three separate head-out immersions in 28 °C water after different <b>preparatory</b> <b>procedures.</b> In the ‘control’ procedure immersion was preceded by a rest period. In the ‘motion sickness’ procedure immersion was preceded by provocation of motion sickness in a human centrifuge. This comprised rapid and repeated alterations of the gravitational (G-) stress in the head-to-foot direction, plus a standardized regimen of head movements at increased G-stress. In the ‘G-control’ procedure, the subjects were exposed to similar G-stress, but without the motion sickness provocation. During immersion mean skin temperature, rectal temperature, the difference in temperature between the forearm and 3 rd digit of the right hand (ΔTforearm-fingertip), oxygen uptake and heart rate were recorded. Subjects provided ratings of temperature perception, thermal comfort and level of motion sickness discomfort at regular intervals. No differences were observed {{in any of the}} variables between control and G-control procedures. In the motion sickness procedure, the ΔTforearm-fingertip response was significantly attenuated, indicating a blunted vasoconstrictor response, and rectal temperature decreased at a faster rate. No other differences were observed. Motion sickness attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to skin and core cooling, thereby enhancing heat loss and the magnitude of the fall in deep body temperature. Motion sickness may predispose individuals to hypothermia, and have significant implications for survival time in maritime accidents...|$|R
