5|$|The {{station was}} built on a site of the medieval steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It was built by the South Eastern Railway {{in order to have}} a railway {{terminal}} in the City and compete with their rivals, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The City location of the station necessitated a new bridge across the River Thames, which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the West End, until the construction of the District Railway. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson, while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the Thameslink <b>Programme</b> <b>development</b> in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.|$|E

Under this administration, a number of initiatives have been introduced: the China Comprehensive AIDS Response (China CARES), which assists 127 high-prevalence counties in providing care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS; the “Four Free and One Care” policy; {{and the formation of}} a State Council AIDS Working Committee responsible {{for the development of a}} comprehensive policy framework (e.g., the Notice on Strengthening HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control). New policies, supported by expanded budgets, have been introduced, which has permitted a substantial acceleration in <b>programme</b> <b>development,</b> testing, and scale-up.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} the Second World War in Europe in sight, the RAF began {{cancelling}} many aircraft orders. Thus, the RAF's {{order for}} the Fury was cancelled before any production examples were built because the RAF already had excessive numbers of late Mark Spitfires and Tempests and viewed the Fury as an additional overlap with these aircraft. Although the RAF had pulled out of the <b>programme,</b> <b>development</b> of the type continued as the Sea Fury. [...] Many of the Navy's carrier fighters were either lend-lease Chance-Vought Corsair aircraft and thus to be returned, {{or in the case of}} the Supermarine Seafire had considerable drawbacks as naval aircraft such as narrow undercarriages. The Admiralty opted to procure the Sea Fury as the successor to these aircraft instead of purchasing the lend-lease aircraft outright.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) Football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> {{view the}} player as a {{holistic}} individual and therefore follow holistic {{procedures in the}} development of football players. The football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> of various football clubs have been used in the search for sporting excellence. The use of such programmes is an international trend at the heart of football development. However, not all football clubs have <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> Junior football <b>development</b> in South African is the responsibility of clubs and football <b>development</b> <b>programmes,</b> with the South African Football Association’s Development Committee only responsible for improving football. The football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> in South Africa are not standardised and regulated in any way. The aim of the study is to assess the management of junior football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> in selected professional football clubs in Gauteng. In order to achieve this aim, the study focused on identifying the guidelines of player <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> at professional football clubs in Gauteng. To identify possible solutions, youth <b>development</b> <b>programme</b> literature of international football youth <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> is explored. Different management theories and management practices and functions informed the conceptual framework for contextual description and analysis. Football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> are described with reference to the management practice and functions of the youth <b>development</b> <b>programme.</b> The methodology included a literature review, structured self-administered interviews conducted with the administrative head and head of youth <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> at selected professional football clubs in Gauteng. This was followed by the administration of a questionnaire that was completed by 30 football players who have graduated from youth <b>development</b> <b>programmes,</b> and 40 players who are currently in youth <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> Professional football clubs present an opportunity {{for the development of a}} player-development model that can cater for the long-term development of football players. Football <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> employ suitably qualified coaches and the clubs employ ageing players in an administrative function. Professional coaches are therefore appointed to oversee the <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> of the club and thereby prepare junior players for their roles as professional football players. Football club management should therefore be responsible for the development of systems and structures to facilitate the nurturing and development of the players in the junior <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> Football clubs have introduced football <b>development</b> <b>programme</b> structures, to facilitate football development and ensure the sustainability of the different clubs. They are geared towards the holistic development and well-being of football players within the <b>programme.</b> The football <b>development</b> <b>programme</b> should be designed in line with the club’s overall strategies. Football development within South Africa is not regulated by the South African Football Association. Therefore it is the responsibility of the respective clubs. Limitations are explained and recommendations for future studies are offered. Key words: Sport development, youth development, holistic development, football management...|$|R
