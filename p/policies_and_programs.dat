5|$|Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{had been elected}} in 1972 with a small majority in the House of Representatives, but with the Opposition controlling the Senate. Another election in 1974 resulted in little change. While the Whitlam Government introduced many new <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs,</b> it was also rocked by scandals and political miscalculations. In October 1975, the Opposition used its control of the Senate to defer passage of appropriation bills, which finance governmental operations and which had been passed by the House of Representatives. The Opposition stated that they would {{continue to do so}} unless Whitlam called an election for the House of Representatives and urged Kerr to dismiss Whitlam unless he agreed to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him, and Kerr did nothing to disabuse Whitlam of this notion.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that innovation is a key driver {{in science and technology}} world creation. However, most of social development in developing countries lacks proper innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs</b> formulation <b>and</b> implementation. The common problem observed {{is that most of the}} existing adopted models on innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> innovation <b>program</b> for social development are due to weak and poor public involvement and neglect cultural realities and practices. The main objective of this paper is to come up with a new suggested participatory model for developing an innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>program</b> for the sustainable social development which include entrepreneurship in developing countries. This paper, therefore, discusses the extent of public participation in the innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>program</b> for social development and its related problems and challenges in the context of developing countries. It determines the public participation and roles in implementing <b>and</b> delivering innovation <b>programs</b> mainly entrepreneurship to support the National innovation policy. This paper is prepared based on an extensive review of the literature. The paper asserts that despite many efforts and initiatives undertaken in the innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>program</b> for social development in developing countries, many of these initiatives have not focused on ways to improve the processes of public participation. Thus it suggests that future policy studies accord attention to the participation and involvement of people on developing an innovation <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>program</b> for their social development...|$|R

Voters passed the proposed law as a referendum in November 1994; {{it was the first}} time that a state had passed legislation related to immigration, customarily an issue for federal <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs.</b> The law was challenged in a legal suit and found unconstitutional by a federal court in 1998 and never went into effect.|$|E

25|$|The Township Committee {{operates}} under {{a special}} charter approved on June 23, 1971, by the New Jersey Legislature; The charter preserves {{many aspects of}} the Township form of government. Middletown Township is governed by a five-member Township Committee, who are elected at-large in partisan elections to three-year terms on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor, each for a one-year term.

25|$|The new Secretary did {{not change}} the {{management}} system McNamara had installed at The Pentagon, {{and for the most}} part assigned internal administration to Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul H. Nitze. Clifford made no effort to depart from McNamara's <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs</b> on such matters as nuclear strategy, NATO, and military assistance, but he favored the Sentinel anti-ballistic missile system, to which McNamara had given only lukewarm backing. Clifford wanted to deploy the system, and supported congressional appropriations for it. One important effect of Sentinel construction, he thought, would be to encourage the Soviet Union to enter arms control talks with the U.S. Indeed, before Clifford left office, the Johnson administration made arrangements for negotiations that eventually led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.|$|E
25|$|The CCF was {{committed}} to efficiency-oriented planning. Douglas set up an Economic Advisory and Planning Board (EAPB), a cabinet committee with a supporting secretariat, charged with planning economic development strategies for the province and evaluating overall <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs.</b> The EAPB evolved into two new agencies: the Budget Bureau and the Government Finance Office. The former was the secretariat for the Treasury Board, the committee of cabinet in charge of allocating budgetary expenditures. In addition, the Budget Bureau had an Organization and Methods unit, which surveyed the operations of various government departments and made recommendations on how they could be managed more effectively. Budgeting became more than the mechanical exercise of allocating money; it became the meeting point of the decision-making process, where all the Douglas government's diverse priorities were integrated.|$|E
25|$|Blind Brook High School {{opened its}} doors {{in the fall of}} 1973. The {{construction}} of the Blind Brook School District's first high school came about after the community (which was the unincorporated area of the Town of Rye at the time) wanted to expand the local school district, District #5. This push for expansion started after the community became frustrated about spending lots of money {{to send their children to}} local high schools including Port Chester, Mamaroneck, Rye Neck, and Valhalla, without commensurate representation or influence on those districts' <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>programs.</b> In addition, the Ridge Street School, which housed classes from kindergarten to 8th/9th grades, was becoming overcrowded and could not accommodate the growing population that would become known as Rye Brook (in 1982). Land was purchased on King Street, and construction was started in 1972 and ended in late 1973, months into the school year. The high school today stands on the same campus as in 1973.|$|E
