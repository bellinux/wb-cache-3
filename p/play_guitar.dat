5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has {{an idea of what}} the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not <b>play</b> <b>guitar</b> in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E
5|$|Although Deal was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to <b>play</b> <b>guitar</b> for the Breeders, because she felt it was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. Deal recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. Deal wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked {{with him on the}} Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley Deal be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter was not able to take time away from her program analyst job. Albini suggested they try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often <b>play</b> <b>guitar</b> with Duvall during breaks from filming.|$|E
5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue {{working on the}} tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to <b>play</b> <b>guitar.</b> Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record {{as much of the}} music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E
5|$|The band carried on, {{adding new}} members Chuck Leavell on piano and Lamar Williams on bass. Brothers and Sisters was largely {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three months at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, Georgia. Lead guitarist Dickey Betts assumed the role of band leader, and many of his compositions reflected a more country-inspired sound. Session musicians Les Dudek and Tommy Talton sat in to <b>play</b> <b>guitar</b> on several songs. The album was being produced {{at the same time as}} vocalist/organist Gregg Allman's solo debut, Laid Back, and features many of the same musicians and engineers.

5|$|Wright, {{whose father}} was head {{biochemist}} at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School. He taught himself to <b>play</b> <b>guitar,</b> trumpet and piano at age 12 after he was recuperating from breaking a leg. His mother helped and encouraged him to play the piano. He took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music and became influenced by the trad jazz revival, learning the trombone and saxophone {{as well as the}} piano. Uncertain about his future, he enrolled in 1962 at the Regent Street Polytechnic which was later incorporated into the University of Westminster. There he met fellow musicians Roger Waters and Nick Mason, and all three joined a band formed by classmate Clive Metcalf called Sigma 6.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden {{recruited}} {{yet another}} guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to <b>play</b> <b>guitar</b> with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, {{as well as}} original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided {{that he had had}} enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{completed}} her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15, during {{her freshman year}} of high school, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing {{caught the attention of}} rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and <b>play</b> <b>guitar.</b> After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson. She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour while also embarking on other performances of her own in the United States. Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December. Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.|$|E

5|$|Ray Davies {{released}} the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written {{two years earlier}} as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers. Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and <b>play</b> <b>guitar.</b> Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with {{all four of the}} original band members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} band in 1984, Dade Farrar {{introduced}} {{its members to}} Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, {{a reference to a}} 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could <b>play</b> <b>guitar,</b> but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.|$|E
