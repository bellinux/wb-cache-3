5000|$|The {{tissue injury}} and repair (TIAR) theory is now widely {{accepted}} {{and suggests that}} uterine hyperperistalsis (i.e., increased peristalsis), during early periods of reproductive life will induce micro-injury at the endometrial-myometrial interface (EMI) region.

40|$|The hormone leptin is {{produced}} by adipose tissue and can function as a signal of nutritional status to the reproductive sys-tem. The expression of leptin receptor and, in some species, lep-tin, in the placenta suggests a role for leptin in placental devel-opment, but this role has not been elucidated. Leptin is required {{at the time of}} embryo implantation in the leptin-deficient ob/ ob mouse and has been shown to upregulate expression of ma-trix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes involved in tropho-blast invasion, in cultured human trophoblast cells. This led us to the hypothesis that leptin promotes the invasiveness of tro-phoblast cells crucial to placental development. We found that leptin stimulated mouse trophoblast cell invasion through a ma-trigel-coated insert on Day 10, but not Day 18 of pregnancy. Optimal stimulation occurred at a concentration of 50 ng/ml leptin, similar to the peak plasma leptin concentration during pregnancy in the mouse. Leptin treatment did not stimulate pro-liferation of mouse trophoblast cells in primary culture. Leptin stimulation of invasion was prevented by 25 mM GM 6001, an inhibitor of MMP activity.

We reviewed a recent fetal scan to identify the <b>placental</b> <b>implantation</b> site (fundal or lateral). Results: The mean cord segment from placental insertion to maternal introitus measured to be 22. 4 cm (95 % confidence interval, 11 to 32 cm).

40|$|Fetuses from gilts with {{estrogen}} receptor (ESR) genotype AA (AA-AA and AA-AB) and BB (BB-AB and BB-BB) {{were compared}} at Day 35 / 36 of pregnancy, {{to examine whether}} fetal ESR genotype nested within maternal ESR genotype would affect fetal traits. Furthermore the relation of fetal body weight and fetal heart weight to various placental traits were evaluated relative to ESR genotype. Fetal and placental weight and length, and implantation surface area were not affected by fetal ESR genotype nested within maternal ESR genotype. Fetal weight was related similarly to placental length, <b>placental</b> weight, and <b>implantation</b> surface area: {{up to a certain}} threshold value (40 cm, 40 g and 250 cm 2, respectively), an increase in the trait was associated with an increase of fetal weight. Thereafter, fetal weight did not change anymore. Thus, at Day 35 / 36 of pregnancy porcine fetuses seem to have a maximum growth potential. The percentage of AA-AA fetuses that had not reached this maximum growth potential was larger than of the other three genotype combinations studied, and therefore a higher subsequent fetal mortality may be expected in this group. Hearts of AA-AB fetuses were significantly heavier than those of BB-AB and BB-BB fetuses and tended to be heavier than those of AA-AA fetuses. The reason for this hypertrophy is unclear, but might be related to a difference in placental vascularity. Heart weight of fetuses from BB gilts increased with fetal weight, while heart weights of fetuses from AA gilts did not. Heart weight increased with an increase of <b>placental</b> length and <b>implantation</b> surface area up to 51 cm and 437 cm 2, respectively, and thereafter decreased again. For BB-AB fetuses a similar relation was found between heart weight and placental weight, while heart weight of the other three genotype combinations remained unaffected as placental weight increased. The fetus and placenta are continuously changing during early pregnancy, therefore different mechanisms may change the demands for cardiac output. However, keeping in mind that placental size and blood volume are relatively large, placental vascularity and vascular development may play a major role. Therefore, further research on heart size, placental size and vascularity, relative to ESR genotype, is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{highlight}} {{the role of}} ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting placental abnormalities and diseases. Patients and methods: This prospective study included fifty pregnant females with placental abnormalities (40 patients with abnormal <b>placental</b> location and/or <b>implantation</b> and 10 patients with other variable placental abnormalities). All the patients underwent US and MRI examination and detailed assessment of the placenta was performed. Operative findings, histopathology and/or follow-up were {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis in all cases. Results: The cases statistically evaluated in this study were gravid females with placenta previa at high risk of coexisting placental adhesive disorders (n =  39 / 50). The sensitivity and specificity of US were 68 % and 78. 57 % respectively while those of MRI were 80 % and 85. 71 % respectively in their ability to diagnose placental invasion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{processes}} {{that are involved in}} cellular invasion, including blastocyst <b>implantation,</b> <b>placental</b> development, and rapidly growing tumors, occur in reduced oxygen environments. It has been surmised that oxygen tension could regulate the cytotrophoblast ability to differentiate and, as a consequence, to express proteins that are criticalfor placentation. The objective of the current investigation was therefore to test the hypothesis that placental tissues and trophoblast cells in culture, under low oxygen tension, release angiogenicfactors that could affect vascular behavior and invasive potential, thus providing a link between abnormal placentation and maternal vascular abnormality. METHODS: Functionally active term placental explant culture and trophoblast cultures were used to demonstrate the secretion profiles of angiogenin and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), and the real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was employed to demonstrate the mRNA expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. RESULTS: A significant increase in the secretion (P <. 01) and mRNA expression (P <. 01) of angiogenin and a signficant decrease in the secretion (P <. 04) and mRNA expression (P <. 03) of VCAM- 1 from both term placental explants and trophoblast cultures subjected to hypoxia in vitro were observed.

She had a dilation and curettage that was complicated by a significant hemorrhage and ultimately required an urgent hysterectomy. Conclusion. When patients fail medical management for a missed abortion, providers need to assess the patient’s risk factors for a MAP. If risk factors are present, a series of specific evaluations should be triggered to rule out a MAP and help further guide management. Early diagnosis of a MAP allows providers to coordinate a multidisciplinary treatment approach and thoroughly counsel patients. Ensuring adequate resources and personnel at a tertiary hospital is essential to provide the highest quality of care and improve outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Exaggerated placental site {{is defined}} as a non-neoplastic lesion {{characterized}} with infiltration of extravilleous intermediate trophoblasts into the myometrium and the walls of blood vessels of the normal <b>placental</b> <b>implantation</b> area. They are commonly seen following spontaneous or elective abortions and present rarely as a cause of third stage bleeding or post-partum hemorrhage. A case of an exaggerated placental site is presented in this article. It is aimed to review the current information about this rare condition. We encountered a case of exaggerated placental site (EPS) reaction following evacuation of a missed abortion in a 34 year old lady. She presented to us, with bleeding per vaginum, not responding to medical management. Hysteroscopy was done and a fleshy mass noted in the posterior wall was resected and sent for examination. Histopathological report was an exaggerated placental site. EPS is a type of trophoblastic lesion and can cause worry to the surgeon at a first glance. Its clinical course has been reported by few. Its diagnosis is mainly by ultrasound and histopathology. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2016; 5 (7. 000) : 2425 - 2427...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH 1) and its {{receptor}} (GnRHR 1) drive mammalian reproduction via {{regulation of}} the gonadotropins. Yet, a second form of GnRH (GnRH 2) and its receptor (GnRHR 2) also exist in mammals. GnRH 2 has been completely conserved throughout 500 million years of evolution, signifying high selection pressure and a critical biological role. However, the GnRH 2 gene is absent (e. g., rat) or inactivated (e. g., cow and sheep) in some species but retained in others (e. g., human, horse, and pig). Likewise, many species (e. g., human, chimpanzee, cow, and sheep) retain the GnRHR 2 gene but lack the appropriate coding sequence to produce a full-length protein due to gene coding errors; although production of GnRHR 2 in humans remains controversial. Certain mammals lack the GnRHR 2 gene (e. g., mouse) or most exons entirely (e. g., rat). In contrast, old world monkeys, musk shrews, and pigs maintain the coding sequence required to produce a functional GnRHR 2. Like GnRHR 1, GnRHR 2 is a 7 -transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with Gαq/ 11 to mediate cell signaling. However, GnRHR 2 retains a cytoplasmic tail and is only 40 % homologous to GnRHR 1. A role for GnRH 2 and its receptor in mammals has been elusive, likely because common laboratory models lack both the ligand and receptor. Uniquely, both GnRH 2 and GnRHR 2 are ubiquitously expressed; transcript levels are abundant in peripheral tissues and scarcely found in regions of the brain associated with gonadotropin secretion, suggesting a divergent role from GnRH 1 /GnRHR 1. Indeed, GnRH 2 and its receptor are not physiological modulators of gonadotropin secretion in mammals. Instead, GnRH 2 and GnRHR 2 coordinate the interaction between nutritional status and sexual behavior in the female brain. Within peripheral tissues, GnRH 2 and its receptor are novel regulators of reproductive organs. GnRH 2 and GnRHR 2 directly stimulate steroidogenesis within the porcine testis. In the female, GnRH 2 and its receptor may help mediate <b>placental</b> function, <b>implantation,</b> and ovarian steroidogenesis. Furthermore, both the GnRH 2 and GnRHR 2 genes are expressed in human reproductive tumors and represent emerging targets for cancer treatment. Thus, GnRH 2 and GnRHR 2 have diverse functions in mammals which remain largely unexplored...|$|R
40|$|Published online 6 December 2016 Because {{reproduction}} {{is essential for}} all life, it is central {{to our understanding of}} all aspects of biology. The Society for Reproductive Biology (SRB) 2016 conference held on the Gold Coast (Qld, Australia) displayed the current breadth of reproductive research in Australia and New Zealand, with additional insights from world leaders in the field. This conference review provides a focused summary of the key questions, emerging ideas and novel technologies that were presented in the symposia. Presented research demonstrated key advances in how stem cell biology may allow us to better understand pluripotency, as well as how environmental and lifestyle factors, such as circadian disruption, smoking, alcohol and diet, affect gametogenesis, embryo <b>implantation,</b> <b>placental</b> function and reproductive capacity. Sessions also highlighted the role of reproductive biology in providing insight into the mechanisms and processes governing a wide range of biological science disciplines, including cancer research and therapies, oncofertility, conservation of native species and chronic non-communicable diseases. Recurring themes included the importance of male and female gamete quality for reproductive potential and the critical and varied roles of the placenta in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. Dysregulation of reproductive processes can contribute to a variety of pathological states that affect future health, fertility and fecundity. Research being conducted by the SRB has the potential to shape not only the fertility of the current generation, but also the health and reproductive viability of future generations. L. K. Akison, P.

40|$|The brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) {{has been shown to}} exert an important role during <b>implantation,</b> <b>placental</b> development, and fetal growth control in mice. Its expression is closely related to the nutritional status in several tissues such as in the nervous system. In a previous study, we demonstrated that maternal undernutrition (MU), during the perinatal life, modified both the BDNF and its functional receptor, the tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) gene expression in the brain of growth-restricted rat offspring during sensitive developmental windows, suggesting that these early modifications may have long-lasting consequences. In the present study, we measured BDNF/TrkB mRNA and protein levels in rat placentas from mothers submitted to a 50 % food restriction during gestation, and in human placentas from pregnancies with fetal growth restriction or fetal macrosomia. In the rat, two subtypes of placental TrkB receptors have been identified: the TrkB-FL and TrkB-T 1 receptors. We found that MU induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) of fetuses at term and decreased the placental BDNF mRNA and protein levels. Placentae from undernourished mothers exhibited an increased mRNA expression of TrkB-FL whereas both TrkB-FL and TrkB-T 1 receptors proteins levels were not modified. In human IUGR placentas, both BDNF and TrkB receptor mRNA expressions were up-regulated. Finally, although neither BDNF nor TrkB mRNA levels were altered by fetal macrosomia alone. BDNF mRNA levels were decreased when macrosomia was associated with maternal type 1 diabetes. These results show that the placental BDNF/TrkB system is modulated in rats and humans during pregnancies with fetal growth perturbations and is affected by the maternal energetic status. These data suggest that this system may exert an important role for the feto-placental unit development and that it may also be implicated in the etiology of pathologies related to placental and fetal growth disturbances.
