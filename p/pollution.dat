5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air <b>pollution</b> {{as a serious}} health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air <b>pollution</b> control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B.

5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water <b>pollution,</b> specifically through livestock manure production.

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was <b>pollution.</b> Brick firing produced particulate air <b>pollution</b> and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst <b>pollution</b> was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The {{greatest number of}} complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, <b>pollution</b> control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the <b>pollution</b> around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay.

Though industrial sources were major sources of <b>pollution,</b> urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to <b>pollution</b> levels. In recent decades, most of the <b>pollution</b> in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, <b>pollution</b> and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. <b>Pollution,</b> especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river <b>pollution</b> has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water <b>pollution</b> caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

How the people have been informed and due to this is an ongoing process, how the risk communication can be developed for this situation. The method was based on a survey which was created using facts and knowledge about risk communication. The survey targeted owners of summer houses at an island called Norrbyskär in the north of Sweden. The island has elevated levels of environmental <b>pollutions</b> in the ground due to a Steam sawmill company, that was active during the years 1895 to 1953. In year 2008 the county administrative board of Västerbotten discovered high volume of dioxins. Since then a couple of different consulting companies have been hired to perform sampling to assess the volume of environmental <b>pollutions.</b> During this time information about the risks has been communicated. The results show that the information that the participants received was good and that the work with sampling and soil remediation at the island is important. There was no change in peoples feeling of security when they visited Norrbyskär. They thought that municipality of Umeå has the most credibility. Knowledge about <b>pollutions</b> was low and the majority of the people wants extended information about <b>pollutions.</b> In the future work with information there is three main words to make the risk communication successful: reliance, trust and credibility...|$|R
