40|$|In {{centrifugal}} pumps the leakage and dynamic characteristics of annular seals are important factors for pump performance. Both seal leakage and dynamics are greatly {{affected by the}} relationship between fluid flow and wall friction. In this thesis explicit friction factors were developed which relate the turbulent fluid flow in the seal to wall friction for seals with rectangular grooves. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to study a range of groove width to depth ratios between 1 and 16 and groove depth to clearance ratios between 0. 2 and 25. 8. In this range an optimal groove geometry for leakage reduction was found which may increase the volumetric effciency of pumps considerably. Based on a similarity assumption for grooves and hole patterns a friction factor was proposed for hole pattern seals. Based on the developed friction factors extensions were made to a theory for predicting dynamic characteristics of <b>plain</b> <b>seals</b> to deal with grooved and hole-patterned seals {{or a combination of}} both. The method does not require calibration to experiments in order to give useful results. A parameter study indicated that for certain stator hole patterns the cross-coupled stiffness could be greatly reduced compared to that of a smooth seal. This means that self excited vibrations from the seal may be prevented and the range of stable operation of the pump may be increased. Another extension of the theory accounts for angular stiffness, damping, and added mass moment of inertia for tapered seals. A previously published isotropic friction factor based on pipe flow in the transition between laminar and fully turbulent flow was also invluded in the theory for predicting dynamic coefficients. Results compared well to previously published theoretical results, however, comparisons to experimental results indicate that this friction factor is of limited use for seals. Inlet and exit conditions of seals affect both seal leakage and rotordynamic coefficients to some extent. An experimental study of inlet and exit losses for seals with sharp, chamfer, and protruding edge inlet and exit geometrics was carried out for a range of axial and tangential flow veloocities. The inlet loss was sensitive to geometry changes, while the exit loss was not. The commonly used assumptions of no rotational speed dependency for entrance and exit losses holds well when the average tangential flow is {{less than or equal to}} the axial flow. However, as the tangential flow became much alrger than the axial flow this assumption did not hold well. In the same study leakage for seals with shallow grooves was studied. Experimental leakage results for shallow grooves on the rotor corresponded well with theoretical predictions based on the friction factor developed in this thesis. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the inner seal face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer <b>plain</b> face <b>seal,</b> by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through sealing faces. The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all pumps without stuffing box modifications, but maintains its dual seal functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges. Detailed design features and operating principles including reducing O-ring hysteresis and pressure reversal or loss-of-barrier gas are discussed.

40|$|HPOTP and HPFTP {{vibration}} test results have exhibited transient and steady characteristics {{which may be}} due to impeller leakage path (ILP) related forces. For example, an axial shift in the rotor could suddenly change the ILP clearances and lengths yielding dynamic coefficient and subsequent vibration changes. ILP models are more complicated than conventional-single component-annular seal models due to their radial flow component (coriolis and centrifugal acceleration), complex geometry (axial/radial clearance coupling), internal boundary (transition) flow conditions between mechanical components along the ILP and longer length, requiring moment as well as force coefficients. Flow coupling between mechanical components results from mass and energy conservation applied at their interfaces. Typical components along the ILP include an inlet seal, curved shroud, and an exit seal, which may be a stepped labyrinth type. Von Pragenau (MSFC) has modeled labyrinth seals as a series of <b>plain</b> annular <b>seals</b> for leakage and dynamic coefficient prediction. These multi-tooth components increase the total number of 'flow coupled' components in the ILP.

40|$|Concrete {{is used in}} a {{large number}} of civil {{engineering}} structures. Some of these structures may be susceptible to corrosion caused by the ingress of deicing salts. While service life models have been developed to predict the rate of chloride ingress, many of these models base their calculations on the properties of uncracked concrete. However, concrete in service may crack due to tensile forces and environmental loading. Cracks may provide an easier path for chlorides to enter the concrete, which may cause the rebar to corrode faster than it would have if the concrete was in an uncracked condition. There are also numerous sealants that can be applied to concrete, both topically and admixed, that {{can also be used to}} reduce the rate of chloride ingress into concrete. This thesis focuses on chloride ingress in <b>plain</b> and <b>sealed</b> concrete that is cracked after it is sealed. The sealer used in this work is a Soy Methyl-Ester (SME) that contains 2 % Polystyrene (PS). ^ Soy Methyl-Ester is a byproduct of soy bean oil and is hydrophobic in nature. As a byproduct of soy bean oil, it is biodegradable, non-toxic, and sustainable. The SME-PS was topically applied to the concrete specimens. Both sealed and unsealed beams were cracked in flexure and ponded with a 23. 3 % Sodium Chloride (NaCl) solution in order to examine the effectiveness of SME-PS at reducing the penetration depth of the chlorides. Titration results show a reduction in the chloride content in roughly the first 12 mm. Furthermore, sealed and unsealed concrete cylinders were used to test for diffusion coefficient, tortuosity, and drying rate. The cracks were imaged using x-ray tomography. This work suggests an increase for the diffusion coefficient in the presence of cracks. However, the diffusion coefficient for cracked samples that were sealed prior to cracking was shown to be lower than the respective unsealed sample. It also discusses however that in addition to the vertical crack that forms, debonding along the reinforcement steel is important for chloride ingress. ...|$|R

How they work is not completely understood. This study examines operation of a <b>plain</b> radial lip <b>seal</b> lubricated with grease and aims at developing a model that explains the lubrication and sealing behaviour of this type of seal. One existing hypothesis how the seals function is the Weissenberg effect hypothesis. The hypothesis state that the lubricant is exposed to extreme shear load, which will contribute to the pumping effect and the maintenance of the lubricated film. An investigation is therefore made to examine if the non Newtonian characteristics of the grease prevents leakage. Comparison between Newtonian and non Newtonian fluid calculated by using the finite element software program COMSOL Multiphysics has been performed. The results show that there are differences between Newtonian and non Newtonian flow. The non Newtonian characteristics contribute to a larger flow in the axial direction as compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid. This may contribute to a pumping effect and transportation of heat near the minimum film thickness. At the edge of the contact, the non Newtonian fluid becomes more viscous than the Newtonian fluid. The magnitude of the velocity in the pumping direction for the non Newtonian fluid decreases, which may contribute to the maintenance of the lubricated film. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the test procedures and {{results of a}} study to create an alternative to <b>plain</b> annular <b>seals</b> as radial rotor supports in Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs). Currently, these pumps are assembled with annular seals which are susceptible to significant circumferential wear, resulting in increased radial clearance and degraded centering capabilities. Centering forces in annular seals arise due to hydrodynamic effects (fluid rotation) and hydrostatic effects (axial pressure drops that use the Lomakin Effect to get centering forces). The author?s attempt to circumvent this issue integrates pressure-dams to improve the hydrodynamic centering forces. Three pairs of seals were manufactured for this study: (1) 1 X-clearance smooth seals (baseline pair), (2) 1 X-clearance pressure-dam seals, and (3) 2 X-clearance pressure-dam seals. The objective was to compare the centering capabilities of the three seals {{to determine if the}} pressure-dams were effective. The test rotor diameter was 116. 83 mm (4. 5998 in.). The 1 X-clearance smooth and pressure-dam seals were manufactured to have a minimum 0. 127 mm (0. 005 in.) radial clearance. The 2 X-clearance pressure-dam seals had a radial clearance of 0. 254 mm (0. 01 in.). Both pairs of pressure-dam seals were machined to include three pressure-dams of equal arc angle and axial length, but different recess depths. The pressure-dams were designed via results from Nicholas. The pressure-dam seals were tested in two load orientations; load on dam (LOD) and load on land (LOL). Test conditions for all seals includes four rotor speeds (1500, 3000, 4500, and 6000 RPM), four axial pressure drops (2. 1, 4. 1, 6. 2, and 8. 3 bar), and four eccentricity ratios (0. 0, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8). The lubricant is ISO VG 46 at 115 ?Fahrenheit, which has a dynamic viscosity of 0. 0306 Pa-s. Static test results include seal loci and seal leakage. The 1 X-clearance pressuredam seal leaks at least twice as much as the 1 X-clearance smooth seal in every static position. The 2 X-clearance pressure-dam seal leaks nearly 5 times more than the 1 X-clearance pressure-dam seal. Dynamic results include: (1) rotordynamic coefficients (direct stiffness, damping, and virtual mass as well as cross-coupled stiffness and virtual mass) and (2) whirl frequency ratios; the means by which these are arrived at is outlined in the proceeding sections. Results for the pressure-dam seals show a significant number of negative-direct-stiffness coefficients and whirl frequency ratios nearing 1. In general, the pressure-dam seals are out-performed by the smooth seals, which have whirl frequency ratios of approximately 0. 5. In addition, their rotordynamic coefficients are sensitive to load orientation, making them poorly suited for vertical operation. When the radial clearance was doubled, the pressure-dam seals did not have a stable equilibrium position under load; thus, the results are limited to centered (unloaded) conditions. Under these conditions, the pressure-dam seals do not retain their centering forces, and {{a large portion of the}} test data reflect negative direct stiffness coefficients (? 50 %). XLAnSeal of the XLTRC^ 2 software suite was used to predict the leakage and rotordynamic coefficients of the smooth seal. Results show good agreement with measurements. No code exists for predicting the static and dynamic characteristics of annular seals with pressure-dams. All test-flow conditions remained in the laminar regime.

40|$|Non-contacting annular seals are {{internal}} sealing devices used in rotating machinery, such as multistage {{centrifugal pumps}} and compressors. Their design affects both efficiency and rotor stability. Traditional <b>plain</b> and labyrinth <b>seals</b> are being replaced with stators containing different roughness patterns to reduce leakage and enhance rotor response. Several roughened seal experiments with liquid and air have produced leakage data {{indicating that the}} friction factor increases as the seal clearance is increased. Simplified models based on bulk flow theory and Moody??????s approach to characterize wall friction in pipes cannot explain this outcome. This research {{is an extension of}} a 2 -D numerical analysis of flat plate experiments with water which found that friction factor of these surfaces is governed by the roughness?????? ability to develop high static pressures. An exhaustive 3 -D numerical analysis of several experiments with liquid annular seals has been performed using a CFD code. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow and smooth seals were replicated within 1 % using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence modeling. Similarly, measured groove seal leakage rates were reproduced within 2 %. On the other hand, no turbulence model combination predicts the leakage in most 3 -D pattern roughened seals with the same accuracy. Present results reproduce the friction factor ??????plateau?????? behavior predicted with the 2 -D analysis and observed in the flat plate experiments. They also reproduce the friction-factor-to-clearance indifference behavior, the maximum friction factor observed in a specific roughness pattern size is independent of the actual clearance in a certain Reynolds number range, but clarify the role of the roughness length-to-clearance ratio and the actual roughness size in defining the friction-factor-toclearance proportionality. All simulations indicate that roughened surface area and roughness aspect ratios are the parameters defining the friction factor at a given seal clearance. The roughness pattern size, relevant in determining the friction-factor-to-clearance proportionality, plays a moderate role once the above cited ratios are defined. In any shape and size, shallow patterns are predicted and observed to provide larger friction factors than deep patterns. Predictions also confirm limited experimental data showing that friction factor is affected by the mean flow orientation relative to the roughness pattern. Solving RANS equations is sufficient to model simple seal geometries but might not be enough to replicate turbulent flow in liquid annular seals with roughened surfaces...|$|R
