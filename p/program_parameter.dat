Instead of displaying the ordered dissimilarity matrix (ODM) as a 2 D gray-level image for human interpretation as is done by VAT, we trace the changes in dissimilarities along the diagonal of the ODM. This changes the 2 D data structure (matrices) into 1 D arrays, displayed as what we call the tendency curves, which enables one to concentrate only on one variable, namely the height. One of these curves, called the d-curve, clearly shows the existence of cluster structure as patterns in peaks and valleys, which can be caught not only by human eyes but also by the computer. Our numerical experiments showed that the computer can catch cluster structures from the d-curve even in some cases where the human eyes see no structure from the visual outputs of VAT.

40|$|Optimal {{engineering}} design specifications are usually derived from an iterative design process. Here, different mathematical programs, each representing {{a particular problem}} assumption, are solved {{in order to gain}} insight into how and why an ideal design changes as model parameters vary. The mathematical technique used in this process is termed sensitivity analysis. The focus of this study is on techniques for performing such analysis on optimization problems which can be modeled as geometric programs. A dual based computationally attractive numerical procedure was developed to generate the locus of optimal solutions to prototype geometric programs corresponding to a large set of <b>program</b> <b>parameter</b> trajectories. Coefficient variation can include individual or simultaneous changes in any or all cost and exponent values. Sensitivity analysis is accomplished by numerically solving a specially constructed nonlinear initial value differential equation problem. Computational procedures were developed for computing an intitial value point, differential equation construction and solution, primal/dual conversion and problem reconstruction {{in the event of a}} primal constraint status change. A computer program written to carry out this scheme was described and used in the design of a batch process chemical plant.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{contingent}} claims techniques {{have been applied}} to various specifications of the economic problem of optimizing the expected value of a welfare function. In paper I we consider the relationship between financial market completeness, corn production, and the corn target price program. Using the observation that the program {{is similar to a}} government issued put option, we found that the per acre program benefit, at around 20 /acre was quite large, that the program encourages producers to trade options, and that the existence of contingent markets facilitates the policy maker in decoupling agricultural support. In paper II we proposed a method for estimating the expected cost to the government of the corn target price program. The model is rational expectations in orientation. It allows the government to understand the implications for output and budget control of different <b>program</b> <b>parameter</b> choices. This model may be adapted to other economic problems, such as the effects of wage or rent control laws on production and factor use. In paper III we suggest that there is an inconsistency between the structure of existing contingent claims markets and how economists would seem to prefer to approximate demand functions. We propose an alternative structure that is consistent with the preferred approach to demand function approximation, and with the moment based foundations of Statistics and Probability; In the final paper we propose an alternative perspective on problems involving the maximization of the expected value of a welfare function. We reformulate the objective function in terms of options. We then show that existing techniques from economics, statistics, and finance theory may be applied to better understand the economic effects of uncertainty.

40|$|The {{most popular}} multithreaded {{languages}} {{based on the}} fork-join concurrency model (CIlkPlus, OpenMP) are currently being extended to support other forms of parallelism (vectorization, pipelining and single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)). In the SIMD case, {{the objective is to}} execute the corresponding code on a many-core device, like a GPGPU, for which the CUDA language is a natural choice. Since the programming concepts of CilkPlus and OpenMP are very different from those of CUDA, it is desirable to automatically generate optimized CUDA-like code from CilkPlus or OpenMP. In this thesis, we propose an accelerator model for annotated C/C++ code together with an implementation that allows the automatic generation of CUDA code. One of the key features of this CUDA code generator is that it supports the generation of CUDA kernel code where <b>program</b> <b>parameters</b> (like number of threads per block) and machine parameters (like shared memory size) are treated as unknown symbols. Hence, these parameters need not to be known at code-generation-time: machine <b>parameters</b> and <b>program</b> <b>parameters</b> can be respectively determined when the generated code is installed on the target machine.

This generation of parametric CUDA kernels requires to deal with non-linear polynomial expressions during the dependence analysis and tiling phase. To achieve these algebraic calculations, we take advantage of techniques from computer algebra, in particular in the RegularChains library of Maple.
