5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{are a very}} {{important}} species in Banff National Park, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human–animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, {{the implementation of the}} Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had arrived {{too far to the}} south, but they landed 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! nonsense,' rejoined Mrs Squeers. 'If {{the young}} man comes {{to be a teacher}} here, let him understand, at once, that we don't want any foolery about the boys. They have the {{brimstone}} and treacle, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> if <b>they</b> hadn't something or other in the way of medicine they'd be always ailing and giving a world of trouble, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it spoils their appetites and comes cheaper than breakfast and dinner. So, it does them good and us good at the same time, and that's fair enough I'm sure.' ...|$|R
50|$|Another curious {{encounter}} {{between the two}} cultures is that the Tenctonese are very fond of clowns, including artwork of clowns. When Cathy moves into Matt's apartment she decorates it with numerous clown paintings and figurines. <b>Partly</b> this is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> enjoy that they're very colorful, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> their alien culture has no equivalent to clowns (possibly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were a slave race), and having {{never seen anything like}} them before, they think clowns are very interesting.|$|R
50|$|At {{any point}} in time, the {{outcomes}} of an historical process are partly predetermined, and <b>partly</b> uncertain <b>because</b> <b>they</b> depend on what human choices and decisions will {{be made in the}} present. Those choices are not made in a vacuum, but in an environment which makes those choices possible, makes them meaningful and gives them effect. Otherwise they would not be real choices, only imaginary choices.|$|R
5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they,</b> in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{organization}} was actively {{supported by the}} newly emancipated Flemish [...] "cultural autonomy". Especially in Brussels they wanted to exhibit [...] "serious" [...] Flemish culture. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> of this, <b>they</b> could bring prestigious orchestras and big names to Flanders. At {{the same time it}} gave the festival a somewhat elitist character.|$|R
2500|$|According to Richard Overy, the Russians {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} Soviet war crimes, partly [...] "because they felt that {{much of it was}} justified vengeance against an enemy who committed much worse, and <b>partly</b> it was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were writing the victors' history." ...|$|R
40|$|Many NESB {{professionals}} {{arrive in}} Australia with little knowledge of employers' selection criteria or practices. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> of this, <b>they</b> frequently take additional courses, expensive {{to the government}} and to themselves in time lost from their profession. The experience of the government-funded Interlink program indicated continuing serious problems in resolving these issue...|$|R
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{present a}} natural threat, {{particularly on the}} small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a cyclone in February 1861, and a British ornithologist, Edward Newton, claimed not to have seen a single specimen on Mauritius between the six-day storm and June of the following year. It took many years for this population to fully recover, but by about 1900 it {{was reported to be}} common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. A number of species in the region are vulnerable <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are restricted to one island, or are badly affected by habitat degradation or introduced predators, and several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century. The martin and the Mascarene Swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary boroughs in England ranged {{widely in}} size from small hamlets to large cities, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had evolved haphazardly. The {{earliest}} boroughs were chosen in the Middle Ages by county sheriffs, and even a village might be deemed a borough. Many of these early boroughs (such as Winchelsea and Dunwich) were substantial settlements {{at the time of}} their original enfranchisement, but later went into decline, and by the early 19th century some only had a few electors, but still elected two MPs; they were often known as rotten boroughs. In later centuries the reigning monarch decided which settlements to enfranchise. The monarchs seem mostly to have done so capriciously, often with little regard for the merits of the place they were enfranchising. Of the 70 English boroughs that Tudor monarchs enfranchised, 31 were later disenfranchised. Finally, the parliamentarians of the 17th century compounded the inconsistencies by re-enfranchising 15 boroughs whose representation had lapsed for centuries, seven of which were later disenfranchised by the Reform Act. After Newark was enfranchised in 1661, no additional boroughs were enfranchised, and the unfair system remained unchanged until the Reform Act of 1832. Grampound's disenfranchisement in 1821 was the sole exception. Most English boroughs elected two MPs; but five boroughs elected only one MP: Abingdon, Banbury, Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth. The City of London and the joint borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis each elected four members. The Welsh boroughs each returned a single member.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Overy, a {{historian}} from King's College London, has criticized the viewpoint {{held by the}} Russians, asserting that they refuse to acknowledge Soviet war crimes committed during the war, [...] "Partly this is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt that {{much of it was}} justified vengeance against an enemy who committed much worse, and <b>partly</b> it was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were writing the victors' history." ...|$|R
5000|$|UK {{historian}} Richard Overy, {{from the}} University of Exeter, has criticized Russian {{reaction to the}} book and defended Beevor. Overy accused the Russians of refusing to acknowledge Soviet war crimes, [...] "Partly this is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt that {{much of it was}} justified vengeance against an enemy who committed much worse, and <b>partly</b> it was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were writing the victors' history".|$|R
5000|$|The film {{confronts the}} issue of women being denied custody rights during divorce <b>partly</b> or solely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> work at jobs outside the home, {{allegedly}} making them less available as maternal caregivers. It focuses in particular on the added custodial challenge that working women face if their former husband has remarried a woman {{who does not have}} a job.|$|R
25|$|From the {{beginnings}} of the family business, the Nists owned their business property and equipment outright. The company survived the Great Depression <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had avoided debt, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did cost studies and priced products carefully and accurately, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> designed containers for individual customers rather than specializing in a limited product line.|$|E
25|$|Measures to cut {{carbon and}} methane emissions, such as carbon taxes, came {{bottom of the}} results list, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would {{take a long time}} to have much effect on temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of Roth 401(k) plans {{has been}} {{relatively}} slow, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> require additional administrative recordkeeping and payroll processing. However some larger firms have now adopted Roth 401(k) plans, {{which is expected to}} spur their adoption by other firms including smaller ones.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{those who}} answer both {{questions}} in the affirmative, several things are to be said. First, we must allow for jokes, then for illusions of memory. Corroborative contemporary evidence must be produced. Again, of the 20,000, many {{are likely to be}} selected instances. The inquirer is tempted to go to a person who, as he or she already knows, has a story to tell. Again, the inquirers are likely to be persons who take an interest in the subject on the affirmative side, and their acquaintances may have been <b>partly</b> chosen <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were of the same intellectual complexion. {194b} ...|$|R

40|$|Asthma, {{hay fever}} (or {{allergic}} rhinitis) and eczema (or atopic dermatitis) often coexist {{in the same}} individuals, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of a shared genetic origin. To identify shared risk variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS; n = 360, 838) of a broad allergic disease phenotype that considers the presence of {{any one of these}} three diseases. We identified 136 independent risk variants (P < 3 × 10 - 8), including 73 not previously reported, which implicate 132 nearby genes in allergic disease pathophysiology. Disease-specific effects were detected for only six variants, confirming that most represent shared risk factors. Tissue-specific heritability and biological process enrichment analyses suggest that shared risk variants influence lymphocyte-mediated immunity. Six target genes provide an opportunity for drug repositioning, while for 36 genes CpG methylation was found to influence transcription independently of genetic effects. Asthma, hay fever and eczema <b>partly</b> coexist <b>because</b> <b>they</b> share many genetic risk variants that dysregulate the expression of immune-related genes...|$|R
25|$|There {{were many}} Chinese-Filipino mestizos in Manila, {{referred}} to as Sangleys. The Spanish were distrustful of them, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> suspected that the Chinese Empire had designs on the Philippines. Rumors began in the Sangley community that the Spanish and Japanese intended to massacre them.|$|E
25|$|Hamsters are rodents {{belonging}} to the subfamily Cricetinae. The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera. They have become established as popular small house pets, and, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.|$|E
25|$|In {{developing}} their Far East trade, the Dutch {{also began to}} frequent the island. The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> used ports along the West African coast, {{but also because of}} attacks on their shipping, the desecration of their chapel and religious icons, destruction of their livestock, and destruction of plantations by Dutch and English sailors.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} literary {{representation and}} imaginative construction of arctic heroism and national character in autobiographical memoirs Fifty years Below Zero by Charles Brower (an U. S. writer) and Thirty Years in the Golden North by Jan Welzl (a Czech author from the Austro-Hungarian Empire). I discuss the ways Brower and Welzl fashion heroic images {{of themselves in}} their texts, and how these heroic images fit into the paradigm of turn-of-the-century heroic polar literature and the paradigm of the national character in American and Czech nation-building pedagogical discourses in the times when the narratives were published. I thereby examine a position of Brower’s and Welzl’s texts {{within the framework of}} national ideology related, in Brower’s case, to Alaska as the ‘Last Frontier’, and, in Welzl’s case, to the emergence of independent Czechoslovakia. The conclusion I draw is that the narrators became national Arctic heroes and their narratives popular <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> their narratives and self-portrayals satisfied the demands of the genres of polar literature, but <b>partly</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> challenged the very ideas on which these genres had been formed...|$|R
50|$|Many amazon parrots have a {{remarkable}} ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> of this, <b>they</b> are popular as pets or companion parrots, {{and a small}} industry has developed in breeding parrots in captivity for this market. This popularity has led to many parrots being taken from the wild {{to the extent that}} some species have become threatened. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora treaty has made the capture of wild parrots for the pet trade illegal in an attempt to help protect wild populations.|$|R
50|$|During 1940 the centres at Brandenburg, Grafeneck and Hartheim killed nearly 10,000 people each, {{while another}} 6,000 were killed at Sonnenstein. In all, about 35,000 {{people were killed}} in T4 {{operations}} that year. Operations at Brandenburg and Grafeneck were wound {{up at the end of}} the year, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the areas <b>they</b> served had been cleared and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of public opposition. In 1941, however, the centres at Bernburg and Sonnenstein increased their operations, while Hartheim (where Wirth and Franz Stangl were successively commandants) continued as before. As a result, another 35,000 people were killed before August 1941, when the T4 programme was officially shut down by Hitler. Even after that date, however, the centres continued to be used to kill concentration camp inmates: eventually some 20,000 people in this category were killed.|$|R
25|$|Coral reefs deliver {{ecosystem}} services to tourism, fisheries and shoreline protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$30–375 billion. However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are very sensitive}} to water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, oceanic acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, sunscreen use, overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algal growth.|$|E
25|$|A CD release, {{containing}} 18 studio-recorded songs sung by {{the original}} cast, appeared in 2002. Most songs were present in their full versions as heard in the show. Some songs were not featured, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were variations on others already present (for example, Rien dans les manches being a pared-down version of Mille millions de mille sabords). A notable omission was Promenade avec Tournesol, a cheerful tune that would have appeared between tracks 9 and 10 on the CD.|$|E
25|$|Happy Feet {{needed an}} {{enormous}} group of computers, and Animal Logic worked with IBM {{to build a}} server farm with sufficient processing potential. The film took four years to make. Ben Gunsberger, Lighting Supervisor and VFX Department Supervisor, says this was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> needed to build new infrastructure and tools. The server farm used IBM BladeCenter framework and BladeCenter HS20 blade servers, which are extremely dense separate computer units each with two Intel Xeon processors. Rendering took up 17 million CPU hours over a nine-month period.|$|E
2500|$|The Kuomintang {{also had}} a {{widespread}} following in the Malaysian Chinese community {{in the days before}} the War, but were unable to mount any significant clandestine resistance to the Japanese. <b>Partly,</b> this was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were based among the population in the towns, unlike the MCP which drew much of its support from mine or plantation workers in remote encampments or [...] "squatters" [...] on the edge of the forest. Most of the KMT's supporters and their dependents were therefore hostages to any Japanese mass reprisal.|$|R
60|$|There {{may be good}} Greens of {{the fourth}} Order, but the purest are of the third. And of this Order the green of all Vegetables seems to be, partly by reason of the Intenseness of their Colours, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> when <b>they</b> wither some of them turn to a greenish yellow, and others to a more perfect yellow or orange, or perhaps to red, passing first through all the {{aforesaid}} intermediate Colours. Which Changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the Moisture which may leave the tinging Corpuscles more dense, and something augmented by the Accretion of the oily and earthy Part of that Moisture. Now the green, without doubt, is of the same Order with those Colours into which it changeth, because the Changes are gradual, and those Colours, though usually not very full, yet are often too full and lively {{to be of the}} fourth Order.|$|R
40|$|Introductory marine {{science classes}} are tremendously popular {{on college campuses}} across the country. They can be superbly {{rewarding}} experiences for both students and instructors. Typically, these classes last for a single semester, and are based mainly on lectures, perhaps with {{a field trip to}} the coast, or coastal waters, where possible. Very little, if any, prior science knowledge is required, making the courses accessible to science and nonscience majors alike.
