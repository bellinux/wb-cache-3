5|$|A Mk. IV tank {{built in}} Lincoln {{and used in}} World War I was {{presented}} to the town on 1 August 1919 to thank the townsfolk for their war efforts. It is situated in St Georges Square near the town centre. For some years, electricity provider Seeboard fitted an electricity substation inside the tank, but this has now been removed. A <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> was built over the tank in 1988.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{composite}} bow {{was adopted}} throughout the Arab world, {{even though some}} Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes the <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> on the back was painted with Arab calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria.|$|E

5|$|On 1August 1792, he {{was named}} {{lieutenant}} colonel of the Legion of Biron, also called the Chasseurs of the Rhine, part of the Army of the Rhine under the over-all command of Philippe Custine. Ferino was named general of brigade in December, and on 23August 1793, he became general of division, {{in command of the}} advance guard. Although he was deposed for maintaining discipline too strictly, he was immediately reinstated; he was assigned to the Army of the Moselle under the command of Jean Victor Moreau. In 1795, he was appointed Lieutenant General of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, and in 1796, Commander of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, Right Wing. With this force, he participated in the Battle of Landau, and helped Moreau and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan to push the Austrian army from the Rhineland into Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign. He defeated the Conde's Emigré Army at Bregenz, on Lake Constance. In the subsequent Austrian resurgence, he maintained the right flank's <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> of Moreau's main army as the French retreated through southern Germany in August and September of that year; he participated in the Battle of Schliengen. When the French withdrew after Schliengen, he defended the Rhine crossing at Hüningen, north of the Swiss city of Basel, until the last French units crossed the river to safety.|$|E

25|$|Around 11:30 am, the Pillagers began firing {{upon the}} {{soldiers}} from the surrounding woods. The soldiers, many of them young recruits, {{dropped to the ground}} although their officers managed to get them to form a crescent-shaped skirmish line around Bugonaygeshig's cabin. During the first half-hour, a number of Wilkinson's men were killed or wounded. After Wilkinson himself was shot in the leg, he {{and some of the other}} wounded were moved to the lake side of the cabin which provided some <b>protective</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the <b>protective</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scabbard: The scabbard, {{also known}} as the sheath, is a <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> often {{provided}} for the sword blade. Over the millennia, scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.|$|E

25|$|One mated female P. clarus can lay {{well over}} 100eggs per sac, and many females lay {{more than one}} egg sac, in a thick silken cover. An average clutch {{contains}} 135eggs. The egg membrane is shed in 2426days, but the hatchlings (the first instar) continue to mature in the cocoon. The first molt occurs 2428days after the membrane is shed, and two to threedays later the spiderlings leave their <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> and become active, independent individuals. They do not hunt immediately, even if prey is available, but spend several hours engaged in apparently random activity before seeking cover, where they remain between twohours and twodays. About 10% of spiderlings build retreats during this period, while the rest do so only after they have fed.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E
500|$|Three {{minutes after}} the count was resumed, the hatch {{installation}} was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, {{which was part of}} the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust {{in the event of a}} launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at , [...] higher than atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{adjustments}} {{had been made}} to the Norton prior to the Senior: a larger screen was fitted to protect Hislop from the high winds, the front mud guard was removed to admit more cooling air to the engine and <b>protective</b> <b>covers</b> were fitted to the front forks.|$|R

500|$|Mouse lemurs are omnivorous, and favor {{fruit and}} insects {{for the bulk}} of their diet. The gray mouse lemur may even come down to the ground to catch insect prey, though it quickly returns to the <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> of the {{understory}} to consume its catch. [...] Nectar is also a part of the gray mouse lemur's diet, making it a potential pollinator for local plant species. A single instance of a male cannibalizing an adult female is known.|$|E
500|$|Tertials {{arise in}} the brachial region and are not {{considered}} true remiges as they are not supported by attachment to the corresponding bone, {{in this case the}} humerus. These elongated [...] "true" [...] tertials act as a <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> for {{all or part of the}} folded primaries and secondaries, and do not qualify as flight feathers as such. However, many authorities use the term tertials to refer to the shorter, more symmetrical innermost secondaries of passerines (arising from the olecranon and performing the same function as true tertials) in an effort to distinguish them from other secondaries. The term humeral is sometimes used for birds such as the albatrosses and pelicans that have a long humerus.|$|E
