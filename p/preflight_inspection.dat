2500|$|On 10 May 1974 KLM Noordzee Helikopters S-61N PH-NZC crashed {{en route}} to an oil rig in the North Sea. None of the two crew and four {{passengers}} survived. The probable cause was a failure in one of five rotor blades due to metal fatigue. The resulting imbalance caused the motor mounts to fail and resulted in a fire. The uncontrollable aircraft landed hard in the water, capsized and sank. Investigation indicated that the metal fatigue crack must have spread rapidly {{in less than four}} hours. The rotor blades are pressurized with nitrogen gas at 10PSI to indicate the onset of a metal fatigue failure, yet no pressure loss was indicated during the <b>preflight</b> <b>inspection.</b> As a result of the accident it was recommended to shorten inspection intervals [...] The aircraft was recovered from the North Sea floor. It was rebuilt and currently flies as registration N87580 in the USA.|$|E
40|$|Behavioral traps are accident-inducing {{operational}} pitfalls aviators {{may encounter}} {{as a result}} of poor decision making. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identifies the existence of twelve of these negative pilot behaviors. These are: Peer Pressure; Get-There-Itis; Loss of Situational Awareness; Descent Below the Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA); Mind Set; Duck-Under Syndrome; Getting Behind the Aircraft; Continuing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) into Instrument Conditions; Scud Running; Operating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves; Flying Outside the Envelope; and Neglect of Flight Planning, <b>Preflight</b> <b>Inspections,</b> and Checklists. The purpose of this paper was to study the nature of their occurrence in the airline domain. Four Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) analyzed 34 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident reports. The SMEs were able to identify many pilot actions that were representative of the behavioral traps. Behavioral traps were found in all accidents with Loss of Situational Awareness and Neglect of Flight Planning, <b>Preflight</b> <b>Inspections,</b> and Checklists dominant. Various themes began to emerge, which played important roles in many accidents. These themes included Crew Resource Management (CRM) issues, airline management and fatigue. The findings of this study indicated that behavioral traps were prevalent in airline accidents including habitual noncompliance by pilots. Attitude management training is recommended...|$|R

In addition to this in-depth review, {{there are several other}} surveillance initiatives. These include safety <b>preflight</b> <b>inspections</b> of commercial aircraft by Department of Defense designated inspectors, periodic cockpit observations on operational flights by highly experienced pilots from AMC's Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Division, and an increase in the frequency of on-site surveys. These initiatives and the surveys are further supplemented by an open flow of information on all contract carriers between AMC and the FAA through established liaison officers.|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{acquisition}} program the Portuguese Air Force received equipment and its technicians were instructed {{in the first two}} echelons of maintenance. The first echelon performed by the squadron mechanics was responsible for service of the aircraft and their equipment, <b>preflight</b> and daily <b>inspections,</b> light repairs, anti-corrosive treatments, parts replacement, and refueling, while the second echelon was carried out at dedicated facilities at Monte Real Air Base (BA5) and was responsible for the periodic preventive inspections and the periodic servicing for the systems, engines and other aircraft equipment.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} an {{automated}} <b>preflight</b> aircraft <b>inspection</b> using a pan-tilt-zoom camera {{mounted on a}} mobile robot moving autonomously around the aircraft. The general topic is image processing framework for detection and exterior inspection {{of different types of}} items, such as closed or unlatched door, mechanical defect on the engine, the integrity of the empennage, or damage caused by impacts or cracks. The detection step allows to focus on the regions of interest and point the camera toward the item to be checked. It is based on the detection of regular shapes, such as rounded corner rectangles, circles, and ellipses. The inspection task relies on clues, such as uniformity of isolated image regions, convexity of segmented shapes, and perio-dicity of the image intensity signal. The approach is applied to the inspection of four items of Airbus A 320 : oxygen bay handle, air-inlet vent, static ports, and fan blades. The results are promising and demonstrate the feasibility of an automated exterior inspection...|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2001, an EMB 145 was {{on final}} {{approach}} to Roanoke, Virginia. The captain had briefed a [...] "no go-around" [...] {{for a night}} visual approach to a [...] "Special Airport". The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased {{to the point of}} a stall. The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, the aft fuselage struck the runway first then settled on the landing gear. The first officer made initial call-outs of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts. After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post-flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage to the tail section. The incident was not reported by either pilot to the company and the airplane was allowed to be flown by the next crew the following morning on its scheduled service back to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a post flight inspection revealed the tail strike. When interviewed, the captain first denied having been involved in a hard landing and speculated that the tail strike must have been the result of an over rotation on takeoff from the morning crew. When faced with the CVR and FDR data, she eventually admitted to the incident. She reported that she briefed [...] "no go-around" [...] because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain. Both pilots had received CRM training, which included crew member assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot. The captain said the first officer was passive and quiet. The first officer reported the captain was defensive and did not take criticism very well. It is remarkable that the damage to the tail section was not discovered during the <b>preflight</b> visual <b>inspection</b> performed by the morning flight or ground crews. The aircraft had an MELed APU and needed the engines to be started with the assistance of an external air cart. The connection for the air cart is located at the aft bottom fuselage section where the damages were visible. The access panel was bent. Yet the ground crew did not notify the flight deck crew. When the walk-around visual inspection was performed by the morning crew's first officer, it was performed during the hours of darkness {{with the help of a}} flashlight. The air cart was already connected and forced the first officer to walk around the cart and away from the aircraft, missing the tail strike damages. [...] Both crews were terminated from employment; however, the first officer of the accident flight and the captain of the morning flight were eventually reinstated with help of their union (ALPA). The accident captain was able to recover her certificates and privileges but was not reinstated. The first officer from the morning crew died from illness prior to being reinstated.|$|R

The post-crash investigation {{reveals that the}} left-hand seat was not securely locked in place, and uncovers evidence that the seat traveled to the extreme aft position prior to the crash, likely causing the student pilot to inadvertently pull up and thus provoke the stall. Examination of the wreckage reveals that the seat locking mechanism could be operated normally.

40|$|International audienceAirplanes are {{periodically}} inspected, {{either on}} the airport tarmac between two fligths (<b>preflight</b> <b>inspection)</b> or in a hangar during maintenance operations. Today, these inspections are done by human operators, generally visually and sometimes {{with the help of}} some inspection tools (for instance to evaluate the criticality of a crack detected on the plane fuselage). In order to make the inspection more quick, more exhaustive and more accurate(and also for traceability reasons), a multi-partners research project is being carried on in order to develop a mobile robot equipped with several optical sensors (cameras and 3 D scanners) to perform an automatic inspection of an airplane.

40|$|Transcription begins] “WEST POINT OF THE AIR” July 25, 1942 Dear Bryant Co-Ed: While {{going through}} some papers, I came across your letter of April 27 {{and decided to}} answer it late as it is. Having {{forgotten}} almost everything Mr. Naylor taught me about correspondence while I was at Bryant I will try to compose an interesting and reasonable letter. I am a lieutenant in the Air Corps and was assigned to Randolph Field as a flying instructor last May much against my will. When I received my wings I had visions of flying bombers in Australia but these have long since faded into the distance. My work here consists of teaching flying cadets to fly basic trainers and myself to fly the new fighting ships {{as fast as the}} Army receives them. In case you have ambitions of becoming a flying instructor, here is an accounting of a day’s work. At 8 : 00 A. M. (a reasonable hour) I go to the flying line and make a <b>preflight</b> <b>inspection</b> of my plane and any plane my students may fly. At 9 : 00 A. M. the eager! young! cadets arrive. Five are assigned and report to me. We have a little talk about what is expected of them and then start flying. I fly one hour with each student and spend about 15 minutes criticizing the student’s flight. By about 4 P. M. we are through flying unless night flying is scheduled. I give the planes their daily inspection and put them to bed. After spending about an hour making out students’ grade slips for the day’s work it is 6 P. M. and suppertime. We are then off until 8 P. M. when night flying starts. This is just a repetition of the day’s flying and usually lasts until 2 A. M. If no night flying is scheduled we teach ground school until about 10 P. M. We get time off every time weather does not permit flying. Otherwise the above schedule goes on seven days a week. For recreation I generally get about an hour’s swimming just before supper at the pool at the Officers’ Club which is pretty nice. You can tell my teachers at Bryant that I never knew what they were up against until I started teaching navigation, meteorology, etc. to these cadets. If you have a chance I would appreciate your showing this letter to Mr. Gulski. I am sure he will remember me as I was more trouble to him than most students. I also wish to express my thanks for the packages from the Bryant Service Club and the Bryant Alumni Bulletin which arrives frequently. Texas isn’t a very good place to spend the summer and work here is very monotonous. I would like to be back in New England where the temperature isn’t 100 - 110 ° almost every day. I think that if I am a good boy I may get a five day leave around Christmas. However, with all the flying regulations we have here {{it is very hard to}} behave myself considering my reckless nature. Twice so far I have been reprimanded for doing maneuvers which are considered bad examples to students. They will admit I am still alive so my flying must be safe enough. Please let me hear more about the happenings at Bryant and in Providence. Sincerely, Kirke Everson [Transcription ends...|$|E
