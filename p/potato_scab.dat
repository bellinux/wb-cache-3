In 1893, he discovered a method of treating smut with formaldehyde. Much of his work, however, focused on the causes of flax wilt. At the time, it was believed that wilt was caused by [...] "flax-sick" [...] or deficient soil. Bolley established that wilt was in fact the result of the soilborne fungus fusarium oxysporum. His breeding work led to the development of the resistant strain [...] "Bison Flax", which was planted widely and made North Dakota one of the world's major flax-producing regions.|$|E
50|$|He {{pursued a}} {{doctoral}} degree {{and served as}} a research assistant under Farlow from 1886 to 1888. During this period, Thaxter published an important Gymnosporangium paper, “On Certain Cultures of Gymnosporangium with Notes on their Roesteliae”, in which he described relationships between Gymnosporangium and Roestelia species. In 1888, Thaxter received the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D., with his thesis monographing “The Entomophthoreae of the United States”. From 1888 to 1891, he took a position as the first plant pathologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. He set up a third department in the Station and named it “Mycology”. During his brief time at the Station, his research led to valuable discoveries in Phytopathology. He described the pathogen of <b>potato</b> <b>scab,</b> Oospora scabies, the mildew of lima beans (Phytophthora phaseoli), the onion smut (Urocystis cepulae), and pioneered the use of fungicide sprays to control fungal diseases.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{ammonium}} sulphate (+ SO 4) fertilizer {{as a method}} of controlling <b>potato</b> common <b>scab</b> varies from field to field and from year to year. We examined the influence of two fertilizer regimes on the biodiversity and antibiosis activity (in vitro) of culturable rhizobacterial populations recovered from fields with a similar history of <b>potato</b> common <b>scab.</b> Root zone soils treated with + SO 4 fertilizers were colonized by significantly (P = 0. 05) more species-diverse communities of bacteria than those managed with ammonium nitrate fertilizers (+NO 3) In bioassays conducted on artificial media adjusted to pH 4. 9 (acid) or pH 6. 8 (base), in vitro antibiosis in bacterial strains against Streptomyces scabies was found to be dependent on fertilizer regime (P = 0. 023), with more isolates with antibiosis ability being recovered from + SO 4 compared to +NO 3 treated soils. Overall, bacterial species from the genera Bacillus (18 - 35 %) and Pseudomonas (15 - 18 %) were major components of those rhizoflora communities antagonistic to S. scabies. Under our field conditions, soil acidification with + SO 4 treatments stimulated the development of rhizobacterial communities that generated secondary metabolites with (in vitro) antibiosis ability, against S. scabies. This occurred both in the liquid and vapour phase (volatile gases); the latter most notably by Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Pseudomonas chlororaphis. We postulate that in hot, dry seasons, antibiosis against S. scabies mediated by +SO 4 treatments, and the competitive bacterial communities they engender, would be less effective in controlling <b>potato</b> common <b>scab,</b> as the active moieties would be rapidly volatilized into the atmosphere. In contrast, biocontrol would be more effective in wetter seasons, the active moieties being retained, in and around the potato root zone for greater biologically significant periods of time.

40|$|This is {{the first}} report of {{filamentous}} actinobacteria isolated from surface-sterilized root tissues of healthy wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat roots {{from a range of}} sites across South Australia were used as the source material for the isolation of the endophytic actinobacteria. Roots were surface-sterilized by using ethanol and sodium hypochlorite prior to the isolation of the actinobacteria. Forty-nine of these isolates were identified by using 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing and found to belong to a small group of actinobacterial genera including Streptomyces, Microbispora, Micromonospora, and Nocardiodes spp. Many of the Streptomyces spp. were found to be similar, {{on the basis of their}} 16 S rDNA gene sequence, to Streptomyces spp. that had been isolated from <b>potato</b> <b>scabs.</b> In particular, several isolates exhibited high 16 S rDNA gene sequence homology to Streptomyces caviscabies and S. setonii.

40|$|Abstract <b>Potato</b> common <b>scab</b> (Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.)

40|$|Evidence for the {{horizontal}} transfer of a pathogenicity island (PAI) carrying the virulence gene nec 1 and flanking sequences among Streptomyces strains in the Diastatochromogenes cluster is presented. Plant-pathogenic, thaxtomin-producing Streptomyces strains, previously classified as S. scabiei {{based on the}} conventionally used phenotypic characteristics, {{were found to be}} genetically distinct from the type strain of S. scabiei based on DNA relatedness and 16 S rDNA sequence analysis. Pairwise DNA-DNA hybridizations between some of these strains and the S. scabiei type strain were as low as 36 %, a value much below what is conventionally accepted for species identity (70 %). The sequence of the nec 1 gene, however, was identical in all the S. scabiei and S. scabiei-like strains tested, irrespective of their DNA relatedness to the type strain of S. scabiei, their geographic origin, or the isolation host. Furthermore, a 26 -kb DNA fragment including and flanking nec 1 was also conserved among these strains based on restriction and Southern analyses. These data indicate that the etiology of <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> is more complex than previously recognized; this result has important implications for <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> management strategies. Previous research has suggested that horizontal transfer of a PAI was the mechanism for evolution of pathogenicity in S. acidiscabies and S. turgidiscabies, species that lie outside of the Diastatochromogenes cluster.

The scab organism may be present in the soil or may be introduced into uncontaminated soil by the use of scabby tubers.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{biological}} control methods against the causal organism of <b>potato</b> common <b>scab</b> disease. This disease is found wherever potatoes are grown and {{can result in}} substantial financial losses to growers. The disease is caused by invasion of lenticels {{by a number of}} pathogenic streptomycetes which historically have been referred to as Streptomyces scabies. A multi-control strategy was adopted and targeted to two key areas of infestation: the transport of infested seed tubers to grower's properties and uninfected fields; and control after outplanting in infected fields. The pathogen used in this study was isolated from a commercial potato field in northern Tasmania. Using cultural and morphological characteristics, the organism was identified as Streptomyces scabies and coded T 19.

When mini tubers with a surface dried infestation of Streptomyces scabies were immersed in a phage solution and outplanted in a glasshouse trial, common scab lesions were restricted to {{less than one percent of}} the surface area of tubers compared to tubers without phage that had an average of 25...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{is a major}} {{husbandry}} tool, {{vital for}} world food production and security. The purpose of this review is twofold:- firstly drawing attention to the beneficial and deleterious aspects of irrigation resulting from interactions with the microbial world; secondly, forming a basis for encouraging further research and development. Irrigation is for example, a valuable component in the control of some soil borne pathogens such as Streptomyces scabies, the cause of <b>potato</b> common <b>scab</b> and Fusarium cubense, a cause of banana wilt. By contrast, applying irrigation encourages some foliar pathogens and factors such as splash dispersal of propagules and the retention of leaf wetness are important elements in the successful establishment of disease foci. Irrigation applied at low levels in the canopy directly towards the stem bases and root zones of plants also provides means encouraging disease development. Irrigation also offers means for the direct spread of microbes such as water borne moulds, Oomycetes, and plasmodial pathogens coming from populations present in the water supply. The presence of plant disease causing microbes in sources of irrigation {{has been associated with}} outbreaks of diseases such as clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae). Irrigation can be utilised as a means for applying agrochemicals, fungigation. The developing technologies of water restriction and root zone drying also {{have an impact on the}} success of disease causing organisms. This is an emerging technology and its interactions with benign and pathogenic microbes require consideration...|$|R
