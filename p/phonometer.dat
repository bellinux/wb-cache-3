40|$|The ototoxic {{effect of}} the {{exposure}} to styrene is evaluated, also {{in the presence of}} simultaneous exposure to noise, using otoacoustic emissions as biomarkers of mild cochlear damage. Transient-evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded and analyzed in a sample of workers (15 subjects) exposed to styrene and noise in a fiberglass manufacturing facility and in a control group of 13 non-exposed subjects. Individual exposure monitoring of the airborne styrene concentrations was performed, as well as biological monitoring, based on the urinary concentration of two styrene metabolites, the Mandelic and Phenylglyoxylic acids. Noise exposure was evaluated using wearable <b>phonometers,</b> and hearing loss with pure tone audiometry. Due to their different job tasks, one group of workers was exposed to high noise and low styrene levels, another group to higher styrene levels, close to the limit of 20 [*]ppm, and to low noise levels. A significant negative correlation was found between the otoacoustic emission levels and the concentration of the styrene urinary metabolites. Otoacoustic emissions, and particularly distortion products, were able to discriminate the exposed workers from the controls, providing also a rough estimate of the slope of the dose-response relation between otoacoustic levels and styrene exposure...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports on}} the {{approach}} {{for the development of}} a machining process monitoring system based on audible sound sensors. Audible sound energy appears as one of the most practical techniques since it can serve to replace the traditional ability of the operator, based on his experience and senses (mainly vision and hearing), to determine the process state and react adequately to any machine performance decay. This technique has been attempted for decision making on machining process conditions but it has not been extensively studied yet for applications in industrial process monitoring. The main critical issues related to the employment of this technology in industry are the need to protect the sensor from the hazardous machining environment (cutting fluids and metal chips) and the environment noise (from adjacent machines, motors, conveyors or other processes) that may contaminate the relevant signals during machining. The principal benefits of audible sound sensors for machining process monitoring are associated with the nature of the sensors employed in the acquisition of the signals. These are, in general, easy to mount on the machine tool, in particular near the machining point, with little or no interference with the machine, the tool, the workpiece or the chip formation. Besides, these sensors, basically microphones, are easy to use in combination with standard <b>phonometers</b> or spectrum analysers. These characteristics of audible sound sensors make the realization of the monitoring procedure quite straightforward. In addition, their maintenance is simple since they only require a careful handling to avoid being hit or damaged. Accordingly, they usually provide for a favourable cost/benefit ratio. The key novelties of the approach proposed in this work are, on the one hand, the application of a systematic methodology to set up the cutting trials allowing for a better comparison with other similar experimental works and, as a result, the advance in the standardization for the development of such systems. On the other hand, the independent signal analysis of the noise generated by the machine used for the cutting trials and by the working environment allows to filter this noise out of the signals obtained during the actual material processing. Lastly, the possibility has been verified to apply the results of this approach for the development of process monitoring procedures based on sensors of a different type, in particular acoustic emission sensors, where the stress waves produced within the work material do not travel through air but only in the work material itself. The combined application of audible sound energy sensors and acoustic emission sensors could allow for the acquisition of more exhaustive information from both low frequency (audible sound) and high frequency (acoustic emission) acoustic signal analysis. This would decidedly contribute to the realization of the concept of sensor fusion technology for process monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{trials were}} carried out in a pasta factory in Bari Province and {{confirmed}} that the existent studies regarding health risks in the pasta production sector {{can be used as}} the starting point. However it is necessary to make a specific analysis of the parameters which constitute risk factors, using scientific apparatus. Evaluation of the risks deriving from noise involved a problem of interpretation. The differences found between data obtained with a <b>phonometer</b> and data obtained with a dosimeter may be in contrast, and the dosimeter data can be a source of concern for the workers’ health and therefore for their employers who are responsible for health and safety. In actual fact, when {{the reality of the situation}} was examined, it was seen that different plant operations involve workers’ movements which can stress the microphones differently from acoustic pressure. Therefore, the noise levels which are actually indicative of the situation in the workplace are the <b>phonometer</b> data. However, these too were quite high: daily exposure levels of over 80 dB(A), 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A) in one case, while the impulsive noise levels were always lower Lpk= 112 dB(C). Evaluation of the risk from exposure to particulate matter showed concentrations of inhalable particulate matter PM 10 which were constantly below the level of TLV-TWA = 0. 5 mg/m 3 adopted by the ACGIH as the maximum inhalable dose in eight hours of work. This shows the efficiency of the dust extractor system, which the firm recently upgraded. However, we looked at preventive measures which consisted of: -	working regulation defined by applying industrial health and safety procedures; -	correct and continuous maintenance of the extractor system; -	identification of workers who are more susceptible to respiratory diseases – mostly caused by semolinas powder - even when exposed to levels below TLW. This study has further confirmed that the risk evaluation is not an exact science; in that it does not consist only of technical and mechanical factors, but needs also to consider the many factors connected to workers’ interaction with the workplace...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{acoustical}} characterization of some orchestral instruments (flute, trumpet, bass tuba, drums, violin, horn, piano and tenor sax) in the concert hall of the Liceo Statale “Alfano I” in Salerno, Italy. The variations in respect of time and frequency of main acoustical parameters of all orchestral instruments used, relative to the C major diatonic scale - one octave ascending and one descending-, are reported. In particular, for the temporal variations of pressure levels measured there is a comparison between the average signal unweighted (LZeq average), signal A weighted (LAeq) and unweighted signal in FAST mode (LZF). In this paper the notes played in an acoustically correct room are measured using a class A <b>phonometer.</b> The results provide a useful data base both for designers who deal with predictive analysis for acoustic design of concert halls and those who digitally simulate sounds produced by orchestral instruments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} acoustical design {{and the results of}} a survey in music rooms in an Italian public school (Liceo Statale “Alfano I” in Salerno, Italy). The locations selected are devoted to orchestral performances and to recording. The purpose of correcting or insulating the spaces was to obtain a good acoustics in locations used at a reasonable cost. The acoustic correction was achieved by using sound-absorbing panels made from low-density polyethylene foam with a closed calibrated cell structure, placed on the walls and on the ceiling, and sound-insulation panels made of geometrically spherical composites. The optimal distribution of the sound absorbing panels was made using commercial software for simulating a scattering of sound pressure levels in a room. Reverberation time was measured at various frequencies with a class A <b>phonometer,</b> using an Integrated Impulse Response, in accordance with the international standard ISO 3382. For each measurement position variations of reverberation time in terms of time and frequency are measured. The results show a substantial accordance with the simulation in the design phase, allowing the authors to conclude that the proposed development is characterized by good performance in terms of cost-benefit...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Sleep-wake {{disturbances}} {{are common}} in hospitalised patients but few studies have assessed them systematically. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess sleep quality in a group of medical inpatients, in relation to environmental factors, and the switch to daylight saving time. Methods. Between March and April 2013, 132 consecutive inpatients were screened and 99 (76 ± 11 yrs; hospitalization: 8 ± 7 days) enrolled. They slept in double or quadruple rooms, facing South/South-East, and were qualified as sleeping near/far from the window. They underwent daily sleep assessment by standard questionnaires/diaries. Illuminance was measured by a luxmeter at each patient’s eye-level, four times per day. Noise was measured at the same times by a <b>phonometer.</b> Information was recorded on room lighting, position of the rolling shutters and number/type of extra people in the room. Results. Compliance with sleep-wake assessment was poor, with a range of completion of 2 - 59 %, depending on the questionnaires. Reported sleep quality was sufficient and sleep timing dictated by hospital routine; 33 % of the patients reported one/more sleepless nights. Illuminance was generally low, and rolling shutters half way down for most of the 24 hours. Patients who slept near the window were exposed to more light in the morning (i. e. 222 ± 72 vs. 174 ± 85 lux, p< 0. 05 before the switch; 198 ± 72 vs. 141 ± 137 lux, p< 0. 01 after the switch) and tended to slept better (7. 3 ± 1. 8 vs. 5. 8 ± 2. 4 on a 1 - 10 scale, before the switch, p< 0. 05; 7. 7 ± 2. 3 vs. 6. 6 ± 1. 8, n. s. after the switch). Noise levels were higher than recommended for care units but substantially comparable across times/room types. No significant differences were observed in sleep parameters before/after the switch. Conclusions. Medical wards appear to be noisy environments, in which limited attention is paid to light/dark hygiene. An association was observed between sleep quality and bed position/light exposure, which is worthy of further study...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Results of {{previous}} studies gave support {{to the idea that}} machines in power plants produce noise of different levels of loudness and frequency, and that it could cause deterioration of the hearing ability of workers. As a matter of fact, noiseinduced hearing loss is the most widespread occupational disease nowadays. As noise is a complex acoustic phenomenon, more factors have to be considered when studying it, such as frequency, intensity and the period of exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} find if there are differences in the absolute threshold of hearing between workers in the factory production lines that are constantly exposed to the industrial noise of higher spectrum and those exposed to the noise of standard spectrum at different frequencies of sound. Methods. In the research plan, there were 308 workers employed in the production line of the Factory “Knjaz Miloš”, Aranđelovac. A total of 205 of them were working in the conditions of higher spectrum noise (4, 000 Hz – 8, 000 Hz) and 103 workers were exposed to standard noise spectrum (31. 5 Hz – 2, 000. 0 Hz). The objective measures of noise (frequency and amplitude) were acquired by <b>phonometer,</b> and measures of absolute threshold of hearing for both ears were obtained by audiometer by exposure to nine sound frequency levels. Data were statistically analyzed by establishing the significance of differences between absolute thresholds of hearing for both groups and for all nine frequency levels. Results. It was found that the absolute threshold of hearing is significantly higher for the group exposed to highfrequency noise at the 4, 000 Hz and 8, 000 Hz levels of frequency. Conclusion. Reduction of hearing sensitivity is evident for those exposed to higher spectrum noise, which is particularly evident at the higher frequency levels. Employees are often unaware of its effects because they are the results of prolonged exposure. Therefore, working in those conditions requires preventive measures and regular testing of the hearing ability...|$|E

Ist seine Lichtleistung einer der Hauptfaktoren für das Ausmass der Lichtpolymerisation, d. h. ihrer Qualität, so spielen im täglichen Gebrauch am Patienten noch weitere Faktoren wie Komfort, Handhabung, Leistungskontrolle eine Rolle. Der Markt von Lichtpolymerisationsgeräten ist gross und in einem ständigen Wandel. Objektive Konsumenteninformationen sind selten und meist schon überholt. Angesichts dieser Tatsachen wurde in dieser Untersuchung ein Konzept zu einer Typenprüfung von Lichtpolymerisationsgeräten erarbeitet. Mit dieser Typenprüfung sollen in einer weiteren Untersuchung alle sich auf dem schweizerischen Markt befindlichen Geräte getestet werden. Diese Ergebnisse sollen dann laufend durch neu auf dem Markt erscheinende Geräte aktualisiert werden. ENGLISH: With {{the spread}} of light polymerisation in dentistry for curing light-activated filling and luting materials the visible-light curing unit has become a standard device in the dental office. The light intensity is the main factor for the degree of polymerisation. However, {{there are other factors}} like comfort, handling and intensity control influencing daily use. The light curing unit industry is large and always changing. Consumer information is rare and often out of date. Considering these facts the present study presents a concept of investigating light curing units. In a further study all light curing units available on the Swiss market will be investigated using this protocol. Newly released light curing units should be investigated in this manner to actualize the existing results. Initially specifications and features are summarised using a questionnaire. Several tests are performed to investigate the parameters of the units. The light intensity emitted from the curing tip is analysed by the radiant power, the radiance and the light distribution across the face of the light curing tip as a function of time. Precise radiometers and a camera for picture processing are used for these measurements. Density filters are used to reduce the radiant power. The measurements of the precise radiometer are compared with those of the integrated radiometer of the light-curing unit. In this way the precision of integrated radiometers is controlled at maximum and reduced output. For evaluating the presence and the quality of integrated voltage stabilizer, the line voltage is varied from 230 V down to 207 V and up to 244 V and the radiant power is measured. The integrated timer is measured for its accuracy in each unit. The time intervals are controlled using a stopwatch. Finally the cooling device is tested. Using a <b>phonometer</b> the noise of the cooling fan is measured. Furthermore, the overheating protector is controlled by recording the activating and resetting time...|$|E
