This dissertation investigated (1) the correlation between frequency of church attendance and number of <b>Promise</b> <b>Keeper</b> (PK) rallies attended by male Caucasians and (a) the level of racial prejudice, (b) Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scores for African-American speakers at PK, (c) the amount of social distance, and (d) the level of core values; (2) the correlation between religious affiliation and the same variables; (3) the relationship between core values and (a) the level of prejudice, (b) the level of SAM scores, and (c) the amount of social distance; (4) the relationship between levels of prejudice and (a) the level of SAM scores and (b) the amount of social distance. This study was a single-subject design using survey instruments. There were three independent variables: church attendance, number of PK rallies attended, and religious affiliation. There were four variables that functioned as either independent or dependent variables, including core values and racial-prejudice scales. Two variables always functioned as dependent variables: scores on African-American speakers at PK and the amount of social distance. Participants for the study were drawn from Caucasian attendees at a PK rally. Data were gathered from the 261 attendees who returned their questionnaires. Two measures were used: An ANOVA and a Pearson Correlation. A significant relationship was found between number of PK rallies attended and level of PB scores, and between religious affiliation and social distance. A Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between core values and levels of prejudice. A significant relationship was found between PE and AB (r =. 26) and between HE and PB (r =. 31). The conclusion notes implications for professional counselors and future research...|$|R
60|$|My dear Reynolds--There are {{two things}} which tease me here--one of them Cripps, and the other that I cannot go with Tom into Devonshire. However, I hope to do my duty to myself {{in a week or}} so; and then I'll try what I can do for my neighbour--now, is not this virtuous? On {{returning}} to Town I'll damm all Idleness--indeed, in superabundance of employment, I must not be content to run here and there on little two-penny errands, but turn Rakehell, i.e. go a masking, or Bailey will think me just as great a <b>Promise</b> <b>Keeper</b> as he thinks you; for myself I do not, and do not remember above one complaint against you for matter o' that. Bailey writes so abominable a hand, to give his Letter a fair reading requires a little time: so I had not seen, when I saw you last, his invitation to Oxford at Christmas. I'll go with you. You know how poorly Rice was. I do not think it was all corporeal,--bodily pain was not used to keep him silent. I'll tell you what; he was hurt at what your Sisters said about his joking with your Mother, he was, soothly to sain. It will all blow over. God knows, my dear Reynolds, I should not talk any sorrow to you--you must have enough vexations--so I won't any more. If I ever start a rueful subject in a letter to you--blow me! Why don't you?--now I am going to ask you a very silly Question neither you nor anybody else could answer, under a folio, or at least a Pamphlet--you shall judge--why don't you, as I do, look unconcerned at what may be called more particularly Heart-vexations? They never surprise me--lord! a man should have the fine point of his soul taken off to become fit for this world.|$|R
