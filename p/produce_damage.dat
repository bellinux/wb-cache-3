5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado to touch down in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The tornado {{is known as the}} worst disaster in the history of Chappaqua.|$|E

According to the Oklahoma Department of Health, an estimated 583 people were injured by the tornado, accounting for those who likely did not go to the hospital or were unaccounted for. In terms of structural losses, a total of 8,132 homes, 1,041 apartments, 260 businesses, 11 public buildings, and seven churches were damaged or destroyed. Total estimated damage costs in the areas affected by the storm totaled $1.2 billion, making it the first single tornado since records were first recorded to <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> exceeding the $1 billion mark.

2500|$|Lasers {{have been}} {{classified}} by wavelength and maximum output power into four classes {{and a few}} subclasses since the early 1970s. [...] The classifications categorize lasers according {{to their ability to}} <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> in exposed people, from class1 (no hazard during normal use) to class4 (severe hazard for eyes and skin). There are two classification systems, the [...] "old system" [...] used before 2002, and the [...] "revised system" [...] being phased in since 2002. The latter reflects the greater knowledge of lasers that has been accumulated since the original classification system was devised, and permits certain types of lasers to be recognized as having a lower hazard than was implied by their placement in the original classification system. The revised system is part of the revised IEC 60825 standard. From 2007, the revised system is also incorporated into the US-oriented ANSI Laser Safety Standard (ANSIZ136.1). [...] Since 2007, labeling according to the revised system is accepted by the FDA on laser products imported into the US. The old and revised systems can be distinguished by the 1M, 2M and 3R classes used only in the revised system and the 2A and 3A classes used only in the old system. [...] Class numbers were designated using Roman numerals (I–IV) in the US under the old system and Arabic numerals (1–4) in the EU. [...] The revised system uses Arabic numerals (1–4) in all jurisdictions.|$|E

50|$|A downburst {{is created}} by a column of sinking air that after hitting ground level, spreads out in all {{directions}} and is capable of <b>producing</b> <b>damaging</b> straight-line winds of over 150 mph, often <b>producing</b> <b>damage</b> similar to, but distinguishable from, that caused by tornadoes. This is because the physical properties of a downburst are completely {{different from those of}} a tornado. Downburst damage will radiate from a central point as the descending column spreads out when hitting the surface, whereas tornado damage tends towards convergent damage consistent with rotating winds. To differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst, the term straight-line winds is applied to damage from microbursts.|$|R
50|$|When a {{low-speed}} deflagration occurs {{within a}} closed vessel or structure, pressure effects can <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> due to expansion of gases as a secondary effect. The heat {{released by the}} deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to expand thermally. The net {{result is that the}} volume of the vessel or structure must expand to accommodate the hot combustion gases, or the vessel must be strong enough to withstand the additional internal pressure, or it fails, allowing the gases to escape. The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern in storage facilities.|$|E
50|$|Learning to {{cope with}} mild to {{moderate}} stress {{is a part of}} normal development in children; however, extreme, long-lasting stress in the absence of supportive relationships to buffer the effects of a heightened stress response can <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> and weakening of bodily and brain systems, which can lead to diminished physical and mental health throughout a person's lifetime. Extreme exposure to such toxic stress can result in the stress response system becoming more highly sensitized to stressful events, producing increased wear and tear on physical systems through over-activation of the body's stress response. This wear and tear increases the later risk of various physical and mental illnesses.|$|E
50|$|During the Starfish Prime high-altitude {{nuclear test}} in 1962, an {{unexpected}} effect was produced {{which is called}} a nuclear electromagnetic pulse. This is an intense flash of electromagnetic energy produced by a rain of high energy electrons which in turn are produced by a nuclear bomb's gamma rays. This flash of energy can permanently destroy or disrupt electronic equipment if insufficiently shielded. It has been proposed to use this effect to disable an enemy's military and civilian infrastructure {{as an adjunct to}} other nuclear or conventional military operations against that enemy.

5000|$|... ===Straight-line winds=== Straight-line winds (also {{known as}} thundergusts and hurricanes of the prairie) {{are very strong}} winds that can <b>produce</b> <b>damage,</b> demonstrating a lack of the {{rotational}} damage pattern associated with tornadoes. Straight-line winds are common with the gust front of a thunderstorm or originate with a downburst from a thunderstorm. These events can cause considerable damage, {{even in the absence}} of a tornado. The winds can gust to 130 mph and winds of 58 mph or more can last for more than twenty minutes. In the United states, such straight-line wind events are most common during the spring when instability is highest and weather fronts routinely cross the country. Straight-line wind events in the form of derechos can take place throughout the Eastern half of the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|When {{stained with}} ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an {{ultraviolet}} (UV) transilluminator. Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation {{for as little}} as 45 seconds can <b>produce</b> <b>damage</b> to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of transformation, in vitro transcription, and PCR. [...] Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365 nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.|$|E

50|$|Around {{the time}} the watch was issued, wind shear values began to {{decrease}} over the region; however, moderately strong winds persisted over a large area, fueling further development of thunderstorms. Ahead of these storms, surface heating from days of above-average temperatures (exceeding 90 F) and a moist air mass provided significant instability, another factor favoring thunderstorm formation. Over the following hours, an isolated thunderstorm developed just outside the watch area and intensified. At 2:46 p.m. EDT, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Upton, New York issued a severe thunderstorm warning {{for much of the}} Tri-State Region. The storm was noted as having winds in excess of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it tracked east at 30 mph (45 km/h).
