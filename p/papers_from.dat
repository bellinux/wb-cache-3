5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him.

5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} <b>papers</b> <b>from</b> 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium. The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{assistant}} director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is given divorce <b>papers</b> <b>from</b> his wife, Sharon, after seventeen years of marriage.

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez.

When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E

5|$|Three {{important}} {{works were}} published in 1990: the Publication of Design Management – A Handbook of Issues and Methods by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book Design Management by French researcher Brigitte Borja de Mozota, and the Publication of Design Management – <b>Papers</b> <b>from</b> the London Business School by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met {{regularly}} at the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, <b>Papers</b> <b>from</b> the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Durham University named Josephine Butler College after her, {{reflecting}} her and George's {{connection to}} the area and the university. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds a number of collections related to Josephine. They include <b>papers</b> <b>from</b> the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by the society. In 2001 English Heritage placed a blue plaque on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet {{across the surface of}} the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. <b>Papers</b> <b>from</b> both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{design to}} {{managers}} was pioneered at the London Business School (LBS) in 1976 by Peter Gorb (1926-2013), the first Honorary Fellow of the DMI and a long-standing Fellow of the RSA. Gorb had previously embedded design {{management in the}} Burton Retail Group before joining LBS where he later founded the Design Management Unit in 1982 (in collaboration with Charles Handy) which he led for over 20 years. In 1979 his talk at the RSA entitled Design and its Use by Managers provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, and {{an appreciation of the}} power of design as a management resource. Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design Management Unit at LBS, Design Talks (1988) with Eric Schneider and Design Management: <b>Papers</b> <b>from</b> the London Business School (1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design, design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).|$|E
5|$|The Free City of Danzig made Hitler {{an honorary}} {{citizen of the}} city as a {{birthday}} gift. Hitler received the citizenship <b>papers</b> <b>from</b> the hands of Albert Forster, the city's Nazi leader. Political and military tension between Germany and Poland was heightened at the time, and Time Magazine reported the possibility of Danzig being returned to Germany. Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, had the Eagle's Nest constructed as the Nazi Party's birthday gift. Hitler, however, did not like the location, as he had a fear of heights. Because of his indigestion, Hitler did not drink alcohol, so a Munich brewery created a special batch of low alcohol beer for his birthday. The brew became a regular order.|$|E
