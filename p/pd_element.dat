40|$|The SP 6 kappa-promoter pentadecamer (<b>pd)</b> <b>element</b> {{was found}} to be unable to stimulate {{transcription}} when present in one copy as the only promoter element in a minimal promoter but showed weak stimulatory activity when present as a multimer (four copies). One copy of the <b>pd</b> <b>element</b> acted synergistically with an octamer element, but not with a SP 1 site, to stimulate transcription. The effect was orientation dependent with regard to the <b>pd</b> <b>element.</b> Gel shift analysis showed that pd-binding proteins were expressed in transformed as well as nontransformed B lymphocytes, irregardless of their differentiation stage, and in HeLa cells. Two major complexes, binding to different sites within the <b>pd</b> <b>element,</b> were observed in gel shifts. A low-molecular-weight form dominated in resting cells, while a higher-molecular-weight form appeared after mitogenic stimulation. Southwestern analysis showed that the low-molecular-weight pd-binding protein had a molecular mass of 35 kDa, which was confirmed by fractionation by denaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular sieving. The higher-molecular-weight complex was sensitive to detergent treatment, while the low-molecular-weight complex was not. Mutation analysis showed that the two pd-binding complexes interacted with distinct sites within the element and that dual occupancy was required for functional activity. The functional synergy between the <b>pd</b> <b>element</b> and the octamer was more pronounced in plasmacytomas than in B-cell lymphomas...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the fatigue {{strength}} of Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 BGAs during 10 3 – 104 cycles, we tried to use the small additive element. As a result, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au are effective addition elements to enhance the fatigue strength. Especially, the additive <b>Pd</b> <b>element</b> has a beneficial effect on the fatigue-strength enhancement. The additive <b>Pd</b> <b>element</b> promotes the glass-structure expansion, which can be recognized from the volume change due to the structural relaxation. Consequently, we found the linear relationship between the fatigue limit and volume change in Zr 50 Cu 40 XAl 10 PdX [X: 0 – 7 atomic percent (at%) ] glassy alloys. Furthermore, we conclude that {{the origin of the}} unique hardness distribution on the fatigue-fractured surface is probably related to hydrogen hardening. The Zr 50 Cu 37 Al 10 Pd 3 glassy alloy, which exhibits the highest fatigue limit of 1, 050 MPa, shows a superior resistance force against the hydrogen hardening. Thus, maintaining the balance between the hardening and embrittlement around the fatigue crack tip by hydrogen is the significant factor to enhance the fatigue strengths.

40|$|Each {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) V {{gene segment}} contains an upstream promoter region. The octamer element and the TATA box {{are the only}} elements that are conserved in all Ig promoters. The presence of the octamer element is necessary, but not sufficient to support high levels of transcription. Therefore, the activity of other co-stimulatory elements is required. This investigation {{has focused on the}} study of one such regulatory region: the penta-decameric (<b>pd)</b> <b>element.</b> The <b>pd</b> <b>element</b> {{is an integral part of}} the SP 6 V-kappa promoter and shows functional synergism with the octamer element at the late stages in B cell differentiation. The <b>pd</b> <b>element</b> is comprised of an E 2 A type of E-box (5 ’-CAGCTG- 3 -) and an AT-rich region. Previous work had identified CArG box-binding factor-A (CBF-A) as the protein interacting with the AT-rich moiety. However, the ligand for the E-box was an unknown. Our work has now identified the bHLH-Zip protein AP- 4 as the E-box binding factor. In addition, AP- 4 has been found to bind to the second E-box (5 ’-CAGCTG- 3 ’) found 3 ’ from the octamer site. E-boxes are conserved within human V-kappa promoter subgroups I, III, IV, V and VII, and related families, hence reinforcing the idea that the natural ligand for Ig-kappa promoter E-boxes is AP- 4. Lastly, we pursued the study of CBF-A by searching for interacting partners by using a yeast Two-Hybrid screen. We have now characterised two important proteins interacting with CBF-A, the nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin(NPM/B 23) and hnRNP H. Furthermore, CBF-A shows selectivity in its interactions, since CBF-A/NPM complexes are detected in the nucleus only, as opposed to the cytoplasmic only CBF-A/hnRNP H heterotypic complexes. Interestingly, we have shown that CBF-A undergoes self-oligomerisation in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In addition, we have evidence to suggest that CBF-A might be shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Specifically, we show that mitogenic stimulation of resting B cells promotes CBF-A accumulation in the nucleus. We have mapped the region responsible for the import/export activity of CBF-A to the most carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acid residues...|$|E

40|$|P {{strains of}} Drosophila are {{distinguished}} from M strains by having <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in their genomes {{and also by}} having the P cytotype, a maternally inherited condition that strongly represses P-element-induced hybrid dysgenesis. The P cytotype is associated with <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> inserted near the left telomere of the X chromosome. Repression by the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> TP 5 and TP 6 is significantly enhanced when these elements are crossed into M′ strains, which, like P strains, carry <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> but {{have little or no}} ability to repress dysgenesis. The telomeric and M′ <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> must coexist in females for this enhanced repression ability to develop. However, once established, it is transmitted maternally to the immediate offspring independently of the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> themselves. Females that carry a telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element</b> but that do not carry M′ <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> may also transmit an ability to repress dysgenesis to their offspring independently of the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element.</b> Cytotype regulation therefore involves a maternally transmissible product of telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> that can interact synergistically with products from paternally inherited M′ <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> This synergism between TP and M′ <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> also appears to persist for at least one generation after the TP has been removed from the genotype...|$|R
40|$|The <b>P</b> <b>element</b> {{is a type}} of {{transposable element}} in Drosophila melanogaster. Characteristics of the {{syndrome}} of “hybrid dysgenesis” are due to transposition of <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> and the molecular mechanism for regulation of this transposition has been unknown. In this study a Q strain (which carries only defective <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in its genome but still is able to repress the transposition of complete <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> although defective in transposase activity) was used to determine the structure of the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> with this repressor (or P cytotype-determining) domain. Examination of the cytotype and structure of the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> of particular strains with reduced copy number of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> showed that the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> with a repressor domain was defective, being deleted between bases 1991 and 2448.

40|$|The nonradiative {{decay of}} a {{localized}} surface plasmon through absorption of a captured photon and excitation of an energetic electron-hole pair is a potentially very {{effective way to}} enhance chemical reactions on metal nanoparticle surfaces, so far limited to Ag (and Au). Here we explore the possibility of efficient and spectrally widely tunable optical absorption engineering based on heterometallic optical nanoantennas. They consist of an optimized antenna element made of Au (or Ag) and a catalytically active second metallic element separated by a thin SiO 2 layer. Specifically, we find that stacked Au-SiO 2 -Pd nanodisk antennas exhibit pronounced local absorption enhancement in the catalytic Pd particle. The effect is caused by efficient power transfer from the Au disk, exhibiting a narrow low-loss resonance and acting as an antenna collecting photons, to the Pd disk due to strong coupling between the two. The <b>Pd</b> <b>element</b> thus acts as receiver that efficiently dissipates energy into electron-hole pairs owing to efficient coupling to intra and interband transitions. In fact, the energy transfer {{is found to be}} so effective that the absorption efficiency at a given wavelength can be enhanced up to 6 to 9 times, and the total absorption integrated over a wide spectral range (400 - 900 nm) up to 2 -fold, depending on the antenna dimensions. This finding suggests a novel route toward highly efficient plasmon-enhanced catalysis on widely selectable catalytic metal particle surfaces not limited to the "classic" plasmonic metals Au and Ag...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin kappa {{promoters}} {{were collected}} from mice and man. It was shown that they had homology within but not between subgroups, and the promoters were also conserved between species. The octamer element was found in all promoters, but other sequence elements were conserved within the distinct subgroups. E-boxes were found in most promoters and were usually of the E 2 A type. A mouse kappa promoter was studied functionally. Two elements were identified 5 ' of the octamer, the pd and the k-Y element. Both had weak stimulatory activity per se, but interacted with the octamer and each other to direct high levels of transcription. The two ets proteins PU. 1 and elf- 1 were shown to bind to the k-Y element. Two independent protein binding sites {{were found in the}} <b>pd</b> <b>element,</b> and both were needed for function of the element. One of the pd interacting proteins was identified as CArG box binding factor-A (CBF-A) after purification and amino acid sequencing. The protein interacted with both single- and double-stranded DNA, and interacted with elf- 1 and PU. 1 in pull down assays. A novel k-Y binding protein, Spi-C, was identified in an yeast one-hybrid screen. The protein was closely related to PU. 1 within the ets domain but not outside of it. Spi-C was highly expressed in peripheral B cells while neither in pre-B cell lines nor plasmacytomas.

40|$|The {{invasion}} of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster was modeled by establishing laboratory populations with 1 %, 5 % and 10 % P genomes and monitoring the populations for 20 generations.

In a second experiment, the percentage of genomes that contained <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> and the distribution of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> among individual flies was monitored. The ability to induce gonadal dysgenesis increased rapidly each generation. However, the increase in P cytotype lagged behind by five to ten generations. The total amount of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> DNA and the frequency of flies containing <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> increased each generation. The number of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> within individual genomes decreased initially, but then increased. Finally, the distribution of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> within the genomes of individuals from later generations varied considerably, and this pattern differed from the parental P strain.

40|$|Several {{results suggest}} that <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> have {{recently}} invaded natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster after a horizontal transfer from another species. The donor species is thought {{to come from the}} willistoni group, which contains <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> very homologous to those of D. melanogaster. However, more divergent <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are present in many other Drosophilidae species. We have analyzed such elements from Scaptomyza pallida, a species phylogenetically distant to D. melanogaster. We report here the isolation of two coding <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> from S. pallida (PS 2 and PS 18) that are 4 % divergent from one another. At least one of these elements (PS 18) is active since it is able to transpose in D. melanogaster and to mobilize a D. melanogaster defective <b>P</b> <b>element,</b> even though its nucleotide sequence is 24 % divergent from the canonical <b>P</b> <b>element</b> of D. melanogaster. To our knowledge, a <b>P</b> <b>element</b> that is active and strongly divergent from the D. melanogaster <b>P</b> <b>element</b> has not been reported previously. Sequence comparison between the complete <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> of D. melanogaster and S. pallida reveals that the structural characteristics are maintained: PS 2 and PS 18 contain terminal inverted repeats and internal repeats very {{similar to those of the}} D. melanogaster <b>P</b> <b>element.</b> In addition, the noncoding regions cis necessary for the transposition are more conserved than the coding sequences. Two domains found in the D. melanogaster P transposase (helix-turn-helix and leucine zipper) are well conserved in the putative proteins encoded by PS 2 and PS 18.

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster <b>P</b> transposable <b>element</b> {{provides}} one of {{the best}} cases of horizontal transfer of a mobile DNA sequence in eukaryotes. Invasion of natural populations by the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> has led to a syndrome of phenotypes known as P-M hybrid dysgenesis that emerges when strains differing in their <b>P</b> <b>element</b> composition mate and produce offspring. Despite extensive research on many aspects of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> biology, many questions remain about the genomic basis of variation in P-M dysgenesis phenotypes across populations. Here we compare estimates of genomic <b>P</b> <b>element</b> content with gonadal dysgenesis phenotypes for isofemale strains obtained from three worldwide populations of D. melanogaster to illuminate the molecular basis of natural variation in cytotype status. We show that <b>P</b> <b>element</b> abundance estimated from genome sequences of isofemale strains is highly correlated across different bioinformatics approaches, but that abundance estimates are sensitive to method and filtering strategies as well as incomplete inbreeding of isofemale strains. We find that <b>P</b> <b>element</b> content varies significantly across populations, with strains from a North American population having fewer <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> but a higher proportion of full-length elements than strains from populations sampled in Europe or Africa. Despite these geographic differences in <b>P</b> <b>element</b> abundance and structure, neither the number of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> nor the ratio of full-length to internally-truncated copies is strongly correlated with the degree of gonadal dysgenesis exhibited by an isofemale strain. Thus, variation in <b>P</b> <b>element</b> abundance and structure across different populations does not necessarily lead to corresponding geographic differences in gonadal dysgenesis phenotypes. Finally, we confirm that population differences in the abundance and structure of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> that are observed from isofemale lines can also be observed in pool-seq samples from the same populations. Our work supports the view that genomic <b>P</b> <b>element</b> content alone is not sufficient to explain variation in gonadal dysgenesis across strains of D. melanogaster, and informs future efforts to decode the genomic basis of geographic and temporal differences in <b>P</b> <b>element</b> induced phenotypes...|$|R

The <b>P</b> <b>element</b> in one vector also carries the rosy gene which serves as an easily scored marker to facilitate the transfer of DNA fragments that do not themselves confer a recognizable phenotype. The failure of certain <b>P</b> <b>element</b> constructs to function as vectors suggests that <b>P</b> <b>element</b> sequences, in addition to the 31 bp inverse terminal repeats, are required in cis for transposition. Moreover, removal of the first 38 bp of the autonomous 2. 9 kb <b>P</b> <b>element</b> appears to destroy its ability to provide a trans-acting factor (s) required for the transposition of non-autonomous <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> Finally, we describe a genomic sequence arrangement that apparently arose by the transposition of a 54 kb composite <b>P</b> <b>element</b> from a tetramer plasmid...|$|R
40|$|The {{incomplete}} <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> TP 5 and TP 6 are {{inserted in}} the TAS repeats near the left telomere of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome. These telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> repress P-induced gonadal dysgenesis and germ-line hypermutability in both sexes. However, their capacity to repress hypermutability is lost when they are transmitted patroclinously in a cross. TP 5 and TP 6 do not repress P-element activity in somatic cells, nor do they alter the somatic or germ-line phenotypes of P-insertion alleles. In the germ line, these elements suppress the phenotype of a P-insertion allele of the singed gene that is evoked by other <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> presumably because these other elements encode repressor polypeptides. This suppression is more effective when the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are inherited maternally. Regulation by telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> parallels that of the P cytotype, a state that represses P-element activity in some strains of Drosophila. This state exists only in the germ line and is maternally transmitted along with the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> themselves.

40|$|In the P-M {{system of}} hybrid dysgenesis of Drosophila melanogaster, some M strains possess {{chromosomal}} <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> The chromosomes {{from one of}} these pseudo-M strains reduced the instability of a P element-insertion mutation of the singed bristle locus.

40|$|<b>P</b> <b>elements</b> {{inserted}} {{near the}} left telomere of the X chromosome {{are associated with}} the P cytotype, a maternally transmitted condition that strongly regulates the activity of the P transposon family in some strains of Drosophila.

However, these regulatory abilities are attenuated when the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are transmitted through heterozygous females, and they are utterly lost when the elements are transmitted through males. Paternally transmitted telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> reacquire regulatory ability when they pass through a female germ line. This reacquisition is enhanced if the females in which it occurs came from mothers who carried a telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element.</b> The enhancement has two components: (1). a strictly maternal effect that is transmitted to the females independently of the mother's telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element</b> ("presetting" or the "pre-P cytotype") and (2). a zygotic effect associated with inheritance of the mother's telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element.</b> One telomeric <b>P</b> <b>element</b> can enhance the reacquisition of another's regulatory ability.

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} are potent agents of genomic change during evolution, but require access to chromatin for insertion-and not all genes provide equivalent access. To test whether the regulatory features of heat-shock genes render their proximal promoters especially {{susceptible to the}} insertion of transposable elements in nature, we conducted an unbiased screen of the proximal promoters of 18 heat-shock genes in 48 natural populations of Drosophila. More than 200 distinctive transposable elements had inserted into these promoters; greater than 96 % are <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> By contrast, few or no <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertions segregate in natural populations in a "negative control" set of proximal promoters lacking the distinctive regulatory features of heat-shock genes. <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transpositions into these same genes during laboratory mutagenesis recapitulate these findings. The natural <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertions cluster in specific sites in the promoters, with up to eight populations exhibiting <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertions at the same position; laboratory insertions are into similar sites. By contrast, a "positive control" set of promoters resembling heat-shock promoters in regulatory features harbors few <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertions in nature, but many insertions after experimental transposition in the laboratory. We conclude that the distinctive regulatory features that typify heat-shock genes (in Drosophila) are especially prone to mutagenesis via <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in nature.

50|$|The <b>P</b> <b>element</b> encodes for {{the protein}} P {{transposase}} and {{is flanked by}} terminal inverted repeats which are important for its mobility. Unlike laboratory strain females, wild type females are thought to express an inhibitor to P transposase function. This inhibitor reduces the disruption to the genome caused by the <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> allowing fertile progeny. Evidence for this comes from crosses of laboratory females (which lack P transposase inhibitor) with wild type males (which have <b>P</b> <b>elements).</b> In {{the absence of the}} inhibitor, the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> can proliferate throughout the genome, disrupting many genes and killing progeny.|$|R
40|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} with transposable <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> {{has greatly}} facilitated {{the identification and}} analysis of genes located throughout the 70 % of the Drosophila melanogaster genome classified as euchromatin. In contrast, genetically marked <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> have only rarely been shown to transpose into heterochromatin. By carrying out single <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertional mutagenesis under conditions where position-effect variegation was suppressed, we efficiently generated strains containing insertions at diverse sites within centromeric and Y-chromosome heterochromatin. The tendency of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> to transpose locally was shown to operate within heterochromatin, and it further enhanced the recovery of heterochromatic insertions. Three of the insertions disrupted vital genes known to be present at low density in heterochromatin. Strains containing single <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertions will greatly facilitate the structural and functional analysis of this poorly understood genomic component...|$|R
40|$|Several DNA {{sequences}} with homology to {{the complete}} 2. 9 -kilobase (kb) <b>P</b> <b>element</b> from a <b>P</b> strain in the United States were isolated and characterized from two Drosophila melanogaster strains collected on Chichi Jima, an island 1000 km south of Tokyo. Except {{for a missing}} central region and trivial unsequenced regions of 38 base pairs, the 2. 1 -kb element isolated from a Q strain had the same DNA sequence {{as that of the}} complete <b>P</b> <b>element.</b> Seven other elements cloned from genomic DNAs of the Q strain and a Q-derived M strain all possessed the same restriction sites as those of the 2. 9 -kb <b>P</b> <b>element</b> except for one deleted region in each element. The finding of sequence conservation in <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> have had a common ancestor relatively recently. Thus, it is suggested that the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> family was a recent invader of the species. By contrast, no complete <b>P</b> <b>element</b> was found in these Japanese strains so far as surveyed, indicating the possibility that <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in the Chichi Jima population are almost all defective. The implication of this possibility is discussed in relation to the uniqueness of the population on Chichi Jima where Q strains predominate and no P strains have yet been found...|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including <b>P</b> <b>element,</b> Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> The transposable <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. Additionally, <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone. The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|R
40|$|<b>P</b> <b>element</b> dysgenesis {{associated}} male recombination in Drosophila {{was examined}} with a selective system focused upon 5 % {{of the standard}} female genetic map divided into eight recombination segments. We found no correspondence between <b>P</b> <b>element</b> mobilization events and recombination in males in the intervals monitored. We defined two adjacent short genetic and molecular regions, one devoid of male recombination and the other acting as a ``hot spot'' for exchange {{in the absence of}} supporting <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertion and excision activity. These data suggest that, even in the presence of mobilizing <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> transposase may be active at non-P element sites, and that the genome may harbor sequences ranging from highly responsive to completely unresponsive to transposase action. A viewpoint is presented wherein <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> with sequences that bind transposase, serve to focus the recombination action of transposase to encompass a region of DNA radiating outward from the initial binding site. We suggest that this region is measured in terms of chromosomal segments rather than limited to <b>P</b> <b>element</b> sequences...|$|R
40|$|The KP <b>element</b> can repress <b>P</b> <b>element</b> {{mobility}} in Drosophila melanogaster. Three mutant KP {{elements were}} made that had either two amino acid substitutions {{or a single}} amino acid deletion in the putative leucine zipper domain found in the KP polypeptide. Each KP element was expressed from the actin 5 C proximal promoter. The wild-type control construct strongly repressed <b>P</b> <b>element</b> mobility, measured by the GD sterility and sn(w) mutability assays, in a position-independent manner. The single amino acid deletion mutant failed to repress P mobility regardless of its insertion site, while repression of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> mobility by the double amino acid substitution mutants was position dependent. The {{results show that the}} leucine zipper of the KP polypeptide is important for <b>P</b> <b>element</b> regulation. This supports the multimer-poisoning model of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> repression, because leucine zipper motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions...|$|R

40|$|A <b>P</b> <b>element</b> {{carrying}} the Dopa decarboxylase gene, P[Ddc], was targeted into vg(21), a cryptic <b>P</b> <b>element</b> induced mutant allele of the vestigial (vg) locus. The resulting allele, vg(28 w), contained the expected P[Ddc] plus an additional 9. 5 kb of DNA, captured from elsewhere on chromosome II. Reversion of the vg(28 w) mutant allele {{demonstrated that the}} entire insert can excise but cannot reinsert at an appreciable frequency. We explain the targeted transposition as the repair of a double stranded gap, created by the excision of the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> at vg(21), and suggest that the formation of chimeric elements {{may be an important}} component of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> dependent genomic instability...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} <b>P</b> <b>element</b> {{deletion}} derivatives at defined {{locations in the}} Drosophila genome to construct a 100 -kb extended <b>P</b> <b>element</b> {{more than twice the}} size of any previously available. We demonstrate that this prototypical extended <b>P</b> <b>element</b> is capable of transposition to new sites in the genome. The structural and functional integrity of a transposed extended <b>P</b> <b>element</b> was confirmed using molecular, genetic, and cytogenetic criteria. This is the first method shown to be capable of producing large, unlinked transpositional duplications in Drosophila. The ability to produce functional transposable elements from half-elements is novel and has many potential applications for the functional analysis of complex genomes...|$|R
