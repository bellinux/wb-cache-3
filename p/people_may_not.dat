5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E

Healthy <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have many {{symptoms}} with methemoglobin levels below 15%. However, patients with co-morbidities such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, sepsis, or {{presence of other}} abnormal hemoglobin species (e.g. carboxyhemoglobin, sulfhemoglobin or sickle hemoglobin) may experience moderate to severe symptoms at much lower levels (as low as 5–8%).|$|E
25|$|Long {{half-life}} benzodiazepines like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are {{preferred to}} minimize rebound effects {{and are available}} in low potency dose forms.

25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|The Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) {{is a free}} {{checklist}} {{designed for}} children and adolescents to report traumatic events and symptoms that they might feel afterward. The items cover the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), specifically, the symptoms and clusters used in the DSM-IV. Although relatively new, {{there has been a}} fair amount of research on the CPSS due to the frequency of traumatic events involving children. The CPSS is usually administered to school children within school boundaries, or in an off-site location to assess symptoms of trauma. Some, but not all, people experience symptoms after a traumatic event, and in serious cases, these <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> get better on their own. Early and accurate identification, especially in children, of experiencing distress following a trauma could help with early interventions. The CPSS {{is one of a handful}} of promising measures that has accrued good evidence for reliability and validity, along with low cost, giving it good clinical utility as it addresses a public health need for better and larger scale assessment.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

500|$|If a {{tuberculosis}} infection does become active, it {{most commonly}} involves the lungs (in about 90% of cases). Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum. About 25% of <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have any symptoms (i.e. they remain [...] "asymptomatic"). Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen's aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding. Tuberculosis {{may become a}} chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones. The reason for this difference is not clear. It {{may be due to}} either better air flow, or poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs.|$|E

500|$|According to Approaching The Possible by Jo Storm, {{the season}} 2 episode [...] "1969" [...] showed that Hammond climbed the {{military}} ladder [...] "by being shrewd, intelligent, and [...] {{possessed of a}} long vision" [...] despite being a [...] "spouted bottom-line pragmatis". Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially [...] "hard-nosed and straight-ahead", and later as seemingly [...] "stern and straight-laced". Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to [...] "bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable." [...] The welfare {{of the men and}} women under Hammond's command is paramount in the general's mind. Besides knowing that <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he [...] "always does so reluctantly and with regret". As shown in [...] "Chain Reaction", Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family, [...] "which must go against all his blustery Texas background".|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E
500|$|According to The Independents Holly Rubenstein, Kaleidoscope Dream is [...] "widely {{considered}} a leading example" [...] of alternative R; Miguel himself {{described it as}} [...] "avant soul". In the opinion of NPR's Frannie Kelley, the record combined R, pop, funk, rock and soul genres. Its music features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman found the album [...] "funkier and weirder" [...] than All I Want Is You and observed an [...] "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Maura Johnston said much of it [...] "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." [...] As an R album, The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski said, Kaleidoscope Dream deviated from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop; Jim DeRogatis believed it drew heavily on psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. Music writers compared the album's style to Prince, Alex Macpherson of The Guardian perceives a [...] "headier aesthetic" [...] than on All I Want Is You, with [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "intimate experiments in Purple Rain-esque rock". Writing about the record for WNYC, Gretta Cohn claimed Miguel was [...] "redefining what contemporary R can be". Miguel said he [...] "definitely think it's an R record, though other <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> ... are so conditioned to expect certain things out of current R, and it's about following a formula. But R was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R It was {{important for me to}} be true to what R is, and that is soulful." ...|$|E
