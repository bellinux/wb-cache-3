All operational elements, steering wheel, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, gearshift lever and handbrake lever, provide nature-true force reactions.

5000|$|Semaphore signals {{may also}} be {{operated}} by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the controlling signal box. In some cases, they {{can be made to}} work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; {{this is one of the}} reasons for the widespread switch to upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to ensure the signal wire returns to its normal <b>position</b> when the <b>controlling</b> <b>lever</b> is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the design of}} an automobile tilting device for tilting of automobile bodies at mechanical workshops, when the need for maintenance arises; especially welding to be performed beneath them is always achieved using an existing traditional tilting technique. The traditional technique involves manual lifting and positioning of the automobile body with one of its sides on the work floor, after which supporting implements such as wooden bars, metal rods, worn-out tyres and pestles are used to keep the tilted bodies at the desired position. This technique has always been resulting to higher worker fatigue and much risk of worker injury, endangering the lives of mechanics. The designing and selection of the automobile tilting device components {{were based on the}} application of machine design and hydraulic principles and laws. The height and the degree of tilt of the device are <b>controlled</b> by the <b>position</b> of the <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> of the direction control valve regulating the fluid flow into the tilting and lifting cylinders. This hydraulic automobile tilting device is designed to provide a more effective and efficient technique for tilting and supporting tilted automobile bodies, thereby minimizing and eliminating the risks involved when employing the existing traditional technique. This proposed hydraulic tilting devic...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for multiarmed bandits that achieves almost optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes without prior {{knowledge about the}} nature of the environment. Our algorithm is based on augmentation of the EXP 3 algorithm with a new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> in the form of exploration parameters that are tailored individually for each arm. The algorithm si-multaneously applies the “old ” <b>control</b> <b>lever,</b> the learning rate, to control the regret in the adver-sarial regime and the new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> to detect and exploit gaps between the arm losses. This secures problem-dependent “logarithmic ” regret when gaps are present without compromising on the worst-case performance guarantee in the ad-versarial regime. We show that the algorithm can exploit both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in the stochastic regime and determin-istic gaps between the arm losses in the adver-sarial regime. The algorithm retains “logarith-mic ” regret guarantee in the stochastic regime even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on average the con-tamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our results for the stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation...|$|R
