5|$|In 2006, two teams, one led by Krzysztof Goździewski and {{the other}} by Francesco Pepe {{independently}} announced four-planet models for the radial velocity measurements of the star, with a new planet (Mu Arae d) in a near-circular orbit lasting approximately 311 days. The new model gives revised <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> the previously known planets, with lower eccentricity orbits {{than in the previous}} model and including a more robust characterization of the orbit of Mu Arae e. The discovery of the fourth planet made Mu Arae the second known four-planet extrasolar system, after 55 Cancri.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} exercise formal control over interest rates, {{and set the}} <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> {{the activity of the}} guilds and corporations, in which it had a special interest. The emperor and his officials intervened at times of crisis to ensure the provisioning of the capital, and to keep down the price of cereals. Finally, the government often collected part of the surplus through taxation, and put it back into circulation, through redistribution in the form of salaries to state officials, or in the form of investment in public works.|$|E

5|$|The {{uncertainty}} of the models {{is tied to the}} error margin in hitherto measured parameters: one of the rotational coefficients (J6) used to describe the planet's gravitational moment, Jupiter's equatorial radius, and its temperature at 1 bar pressure. The Juno mission, which arrived in July 2016, is expected to further constrain the values of these <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> better models of the core.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> {{such a large}} body. Its orbit {{is highly}} {{inclined}} and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E
5|$|The Livestock Conservancy {{maintains}} a conservation priority list that divides endangered breeds of horses, asses, sheep, goats, cattle, rabbits, {{pigs and poultry}} into five categories based on population numbers and historical interest. The organization has published several books, and works with breed registries and other groups on several aspects of breed preservation, including genetic testing, historical documentation, animal rescue and marketing. Preservation of genetic material is of special interest to the Conservancy, and {{for a period of}} time it maintained a gene bank that was later transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture. It has also developed and published several heritage definitions, including <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> heritage breeds of cattle and poultry.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors of}} Kepler-14b's {{discovery}} paper noted that, {{had they not}} discovered that Kepler-14 was indeed a binary system, the <b>parameters</b> <b>for</b> Kepler-14b would have been extremely inaccurate. They noted that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements might not have accounted {{for the possibility that}} their host stars were binary systems; the only way that this was definitely known in the case of Kepler-14 was through the use of high-resolution imaging. If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E
