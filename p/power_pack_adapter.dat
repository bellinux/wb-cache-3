40|$|The <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> {{of these}} {{machines}} {{is composed of}} an engine, fuel tank and oil tank. Energy is transferred to the Casing Rotor through the engine inside the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> In this study, the generated noise of a <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> was predicted, to provide {{suggestions on how to}} improve the noise level. First, we constructed a 3 D model of the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> A finite element analysis was performed using ANSYS. We then analysed the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> through the generated acoustic analysis. Finally, we suggest a way to reduce the noise during the design stage using the analysis result...|$|R

Gurihiru Studios returned for the artwork; however, Fred Van Lente replaced Mark Sumerak as writer. The series pitted the Pack against the Fantastic Four's enemies and also featured Franklin Richards, who, as Tattletale, {{was a member of}} <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> in the regular Marvel Universe.|$|R
50|$|A fifth <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> miniseries, Hulk & <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> {{debuted in}} March 2007, {{following}} {{the events of}} the Spider-Man and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> miniseries. The series involved the Hulk and his enemies the Absorbing Man, Abomination, and Zzzax. The miniseries was drawn by David Williams (except for issue #3, which was drawn by Andy Kuhn).|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{flexibility}} and supplement the transportation <b>power</b> <b>packs</b> around the battlefield, the British Army procured a quantity of dedicated CRARRV High Mobility Trailers (CRARRV HMT). Each CRARRV HMT enables a CRARRV to transport a single (Challenger, Titan or Trojan) <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> or two Warrior <b>power</b> <b>packs</b> by altering the configuration of dedicated fixtures and attachment of fittings.|$|R

50|$|Julie Power {{featured}} in all 62 issues of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> published by Marvel Comics between 1984 and 1991. Between issues 1 and 25 {{of the original}} <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> series, Julie starred as the alter-ego of the superhero Lightspeed, but her superhero codename changed to Molecula when she gained her brother Jack's powers {{during the course of}} a storyline. She continued as Molecula between issues 25—52 until she regained her original powers and superhero name (Lightspeed), which she retained until <b>Power</b> <b>Pack's</b> cancellation with issue #62. Julie later appeared in both the 1992 <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> Holiday Special and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> Vol.2 miniseries 'Peer Pressure,' which was published in 2000, at some point changing her superhero name to Starstreak in the intervening years. During this publishing hiatus, her only appearances were brief cameos in New Warriors.|$|R

Two of the X-Men, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde, stop this plan.|$|R
50|$|Trash is {{a street}} gang {{made up of}} superhuman mutant youths, and it was {{originally}} employed by an older mutant drug kingpin named the Garbage Man. The original lineup of Trash included Airhead, Blasting Cap, Brute, Crazy Legs, and Razor Cut. The Garbage Man employed the gang to run drugs to his various crackhouses. On one such mission, Trash encountered and fought <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> Trash allowed the young heroes to follow {{them back to the}} Garbage Man’s headquarters, hoping to trap them. Trash and Garbage Man beat and captured <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> and Garbage Man ordered the gang to kill the members of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> with a lethal overdose of drugs. When Trash refused, they were forced to fight their criminal employer, and they freed <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> to help. Blasting Cap blew up the Garbage Man’s warehouse, but the members of Trash assumed that he had escaped and would find them later. Despite a hefty admonishing by <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> and scarred by their bad experiences with society as they were, Trash surmised that becoming heroes like <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> was no option for them.|$|R
50|$|Nova later {{encountered}} {{an injured}} Elan. She battled the second Star-Stalker, and then met the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> A stimulator device temporarily rendered her evil, {{until she was}} subdued by Reed and Franklin Richards, and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Under normal circumstances, the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> in the whip's handle {{has enough}} power to extend or retract the weapon for hours. [...] The whip is {{equipped}} with a specially-constructed step transformer that when activated by Hardware amplifies the <b>power</b> <b>pack.</b> [...] This causes a small burst of high-energy plasma to be released from the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> and race to the tip of the whip. [...] Hence, the destructive plasma charge can be delivered to a specific target.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Quesada {{announced}} in a New Joe Fridays column at Newsarama that <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> would {{be returning to}} the Marvel Universe in late 2007, after the events of Civil War. However, due to the various delays within their release shipping schedules for Marvel Comics, <b>Power</b> <b>Pack's</b> was delayed. A new <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> story was commissioned for the 2007 Marvel Holiday Special, {{which would have been}} the first original material featuring the full cast in the standard Marvel Universe since the 2000 mini-series. It was briefly summarized [...] "Power Pack relives holidays past" [...] in official Marvel solicits, but the story was scrapped from the publication at the last minute, when it was decided to prioritize recently canceled title The Loners, which features Julie Power among its cast. A Loners story written by CB Cebulski ran in place of the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> strip, though the official publicity release and solicit information still lists the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> story and description.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Marvel 2099 event, Julie, Jack, and Kate form the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> 2099. All {{of them are}} adults, whom their powers have since [...] "Slowed their aging to a crawl". Alex is notably missing with no full explanation. They have been hired by Alchemax CEO J. Jonah Jameson to take down Captain America 2099, and Spider-Man 2099. Eventually, it is revealed that the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> are the shape-shifting the Skrulls, who are fully brainwashed into believing they were the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b>|$|R
5000|$|FV512 Mechanised Combat Repair Vehicle. Operated by REME {{detachments}} in Armoured Infantry battalions.

50|$|Jack was a {{founding}} member of the superhero team <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> The second youngest of the four Power siblings, he was 8 1/2 years old when he was given his powers by Aelfyre Whitemane, a dying Kymellian noble. He continued to operate with <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> through their entire history.|$|R
50|$|A tenth miniseries, Wolverine and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> {{made its}} debut in November 2008. Wolverine had {{previously}} appeared in the X-Men and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> miniseries. The series reunited the original creative team of Marc Sumerak and Gurihiru. Logan and the four children confronted Sauron, faced the Danger Room, and defended the Xavier school against Sentinels, giant robots programmed for anti-mutant genocide. Since the Power siblings are not actually mutants, their intervention was decisive {{in the outcome of}} the latter battle. Logan and <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> have adventures together in 19th-century New York City and 20th-century Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|After {{the events}} of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> #1-#5 which {{detailed}} the team's origin, the Power family moved from Virginia to New York City. There, <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> encountered other superheroes such as Spider-Man, and Cloak and Dagger. They also met Franklin Richards, and encountered the New Mutants. Julie's powers were later siphoned into the Snark Jakal; when returned, her powers were exchanged with those of her brother Jack, and she became Molecula. Eventually, she regained her original powers and resumed her original codename. <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> then encountered Galactus and Nova.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{retelling of}} the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> origins, {{set in the}} Marvel Adventures continuum, H.E.R.B.I.E. is portrayed in a role similar to his Son of a Genius one, acting {{essentially}} as a nanny and a [...] "big brother" [...] friend to Franklin and his superpowered friends. He harbors an unrequited crush for Friday, the sentient ship acting as the [...] "guardian" [...] of the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> coming to help Franklin in saving the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> by Skrull impostors only to have an excuse to see [...] "her" [...] again.|$|R

50|$|A {{young girl}} called Francine Power {{appeared}} {{under the name}} PowerPax in X-Force Annual #1, {{as part of a}} story set years in the future of the Marvel Universe. This PowerPax not only utilized the collective <b>powers</b> of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> but wore the same costume Alex would be seen wearing when he took the collective <b>powers</b> of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> for himself and operated as a superhero also called PowerPax. The X-Force Annual came several years before Alex' tenure as a featured cast member of the New Warriors, but both were written by <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> editor Fabian Nicieza.|$|R
50|$|Alex {{appears in}} the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> all ages miniseries line. He is similar in age and {{appearance}} to the version of the character as seen in <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> Vol. 1, though he is portrayed as not needing to make physical contact with something to negate its gravity, often doing so from a distance - in the original <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> series, he can only affect objects by physical contact. His sometimes antagonistic relationship with younger sister Katie is also absent, with Alex pointedly nurturing his younger sister through her difficulties in hiding the family's powers from their parents.|$|R
50|$|The bout {{of madness}} was {{explained}} {{later in the}} series, when Lord Yrik revealed that he had placed mental blocks on both the Power parents, {{in order to help}} the children hide their superhero identities. The blocks caused James and Maggie to accept any suggestions and deny any evidence of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack's</b> existence. However, they also caused the parents to go mad when confronted with indisputable proof of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack's</b> existence. The members of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> were understandably upset when they discovered the blocks placed on their parents' minds and requested that they be removed, however, Yrik was unable to do so.|$|R

50|$|A ninth series, Skrulls vs <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> {{made its}} debut in July 2008. The storyline {{involved}} the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> encountering the alien Skrulls. This miniseries also introduced the Kymellian Kofi Whitemane to this continuity. The creative team was Fred Van Lente as writer and Cory Hamscher as artist. Gurihiru provided the covers and the colors.|$|R
5000|$|FV513 Mechanised Recovery Vehicle (Repair). Also {{operated}} by REME detachments in Armoured Infantry battalions. It {{is equipped with}} a 20 tonne winch and 6.5 tonne crane plus power tools and (like the FV512) is able to tow a trailer carrying two Warrior <b>power</b> <b>packs</b> or one Challenger <b>power</b> <b>pack.</b> 39 of these were produced.|$|R
