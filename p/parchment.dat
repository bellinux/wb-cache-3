5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings and bishops, and purple <b>parchment</b> was rarely used for writing. This document {{is regarded as}} one of the most luxurious and beautiful examples of the use of purple <b>parchment.</b> In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.|$|E
5|$|They {{are written}} by a scribe with special ink on <b>parchment</b> scrolls (klaf). The Hebrew Ashuri script must be used and there are three main styles of {{lettering}} used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim. The passages contain 3,188 letters, which take a sofer (scribe) between 10–15 hours to complete. The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of <b>parchment.</b> The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of <b>parchment</b> is placed.|$|E
5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or <b>parchment,</b> {{put together by}} qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and <b>parchment</b> are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, it is {{important}} to consider which samples are most appropriate to model changes in water content. For instance, [36] found that artificially aged <b>parchments</b> were not comparable to historic <b>parchments.</b> They report no correlation with regard to the amount of water taken up by the historical and artificially aged samples. This indicates that the mechanism of degradation of collagen is an important factor that needs to be considered when designing future studies, and artificially aged <b>parchments</b> may not always provide an adequate model for the behaviour of historical <b>parchments</b> at different RH.|$|R
30|$|The {{study by}} Dernovšková, et al.,[35] {{investigated}} {{the amount of}} water absorbed by <b>parchments</b> at different RH, and found that 16 th century (historical) <b>parchments</b> typically absorb more water than new <b>parchments,</b> and that the maximum water absorption was achieved at 45.5 % RH and 28.1 % RH respectively. Although no evidence was provided in the study, it is possible to speculate that the difference in {{the amount of water}} absorbed and the RH when maximum water absorption was reached were the result of a difference in the proportions of collagen and gelatine between samples. Older <b>parchments</b> are often found to have larger proportions of gelatine because they have usually been exposed to damaging environmental conditions, such as UV light, for much longer.|$|R
40|$|The <b>parchments</b> were {{characterized}} by microscopy and non-destructive techniques (FTIR-ATR and micro-Raman) and, microsamples were collected in order to perform protein and DNA extraction processes. Results allowed to identify differences at structural level, based on hole patterns and molecular signs. Proteic and DNA profiles, obtained by Native-PAGE and M 13 -PCR, respectively, allowed to distinguish <b>parchments</b> with different animal origins. The application of these approaches, using proteic and molecular markers, {{seems to be a}} useful tool to complement the study and identification of the animal sources of historical <b>parchments...</b>|$|R
5|$|The folios {{are made}} of vellum <b>parchment</b> {{primarily}} from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the <b>parchment</b> had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. As {{for the cost of}} the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name was}} printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic {{signature}} appears {{on a different}} document—a sheet of <b>parchment</b> that was carefully handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present.

5|$|The codex {{has survived}} {{to the present}} day in a very fragmentary condition. It {{contains}} only the text of the Epistle to the Romans 11-15 on four <b>parchment</b> leaves (size 26.5cm by 21.5cm). The text is written in two parallel columns, 27 lines per column. The left column is in Gothic, the right in Latin.|$|E
5|$|The codex is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in uncial letters on <b>parchment.</b> Scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with the Codex Vaticanus.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{category}} proposed in [5] of logic system presentations equipped with cryptomorphisms {{gives rise to a}} category of <b>parchments</b> that is both complete and translatable to the category of institutions, improving on previous work [15].

500|$|To give {{credibility}} to the fabricated lineage and pedigree, Plantard and his friend, Philippe de Chérisey, needed to create [...] "independent evidence". So during the 1960s, they created and deposited a series of false documents, {{the most famous of}} which was entitled Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau ("The Secret Files of Henri Lobineau"), at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. During the same decade, Plantard commissioned de Chérisey to forge two medieval <b>parchments.</b> These <b>parchments</b> contained encrypted messages that referred to the Priory of Sion. They adapted, and used to their advantage, the earlier false claims put forward by Noël Corbu that a Catholic priest named Bérenger Saunière had supposedly discovered ancient <b>parchments</b> inside a pillar while renovating his church in Rennes-le-Château in 1891. Inspired by the popularity of media reports and books in France about the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in the West Bank, they hoped this same theme would attract attention to their <b>parchments.</b> Their version of the <b>parchments</b> was intended to prove Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion being a medieval society that was the source of the [...] "underground stream" [...] of esotericism in Europe.|$|R
5|$|As {{well as his}} {{building}} projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a gospel book written on <b>parchment</b> dyed purple, with gold lettering. The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. When the church he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in <b>parchment</b> paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E

5|$|Codex Boreelianus, Codex Boreelianus Rheno-Trajectinus (full name), {{designated}} by Fe or 09 in the Gregory-Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering, is a 9th (or 10th) century uncial manuscript {{of the four}} Gospels in Greek. The manuscript, written on <b>parchment,</b> is full of lacunae (or gaps), many of which arose between 1751 and 1830. The codex was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel (1577–1629), who brought it from the East.|$|E
5|$|Codex Carolinus is a Gothic-Latin diglot uncial {{manuscript}} of the New Testament on <b>parchment,</b> dated to the 6th or 7th century. The Gothic text is designated by siglum Car, the Latin text is designated by siglum gue (traditional system) or by 79 (on {{the list of}} Beuron), it represents the Old Latin translation of the New Testament. It is housed in the Herzog August Bibliothek.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. <b>Parchment</b> rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E

5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The <b>parchment</b> worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 1965, {{as part of}} {{the opening}} ceremonies for the second season of the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair, Abebe and fellow athlete and Imperial Guardsman Mamo Wolde, ran a {{ceremonial}} half-marathon from the Arsenal in Central Park (at 64th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan) to the Singer Bowl at the fair.

5|$|The lower {{text of the}} {{manuscript}} contains fragments of the chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse <b>parchment</b> leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed uncial script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{treatment}} stabilized the ink of the text using a gelatin adhesive. The dirt and grime were then cleaned from the <b>parchments,</b> though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten the <b>parchments.</b> The Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All the <b>parchments</b> were then installed into new titanium and aluminum encasements, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are filled with inert argon gas. The current environmental conditions of the Charters of Freedom encasements is monitored by scientists and conservators for signs of possible deterioration agents.|$|R
