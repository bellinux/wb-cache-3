40|$|An {{improved}} low {{bleed water}} CLSM mix was field tested on May 13, 1997 at the Throop <b>portable</b> <b>auger</b> batching plant. Production and pumping tests were very successful. The four {{cubic yards of}} material pumped into a ply wood form where it flowed 48 feet (the {{entire length of the}} form). The CLSM slurry was very uniform, self leveling, cohesive, showed no segregation, and had no bleed water. Properties of the High Performance CLSM were the same for material collected at the auger {{and at the end of}} the pipeline except for the air content which was 5. 5 % at the auger and 3. 2 % at the end of the pipeline. This is exactly what was expected and indicates that this CLSM is easy to mix and pump in the Throop/BSRI equipment. CLSM Mix TW- 10 is recommended for Tank Closure based on the field batching and pumping tests...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{investigation}} of the ecohydrological conditions at four west coast dunefields (Ainsdale, Newborough Warren, Whiteford Burrows and Braunton Burrows) has recently been focused at Braunton in North Devon. BGS Opportunity Funds, coupled with the acquisition by CEH of a pneumatic <b>portable</b> <b>auger,</b> has enabled investigation and sampling from cores taken from ‘deep’ boreholes beneath the high dunes at Braunton along the existing Sandy Lane Shore Slack transect. Work has previously focused on the slack floors and the shallow water table beneath them. Analyses of chemistry, stable isotopes, SF 6, as well as grain size and falling head permeability will, in due course, enable {{a better understanding of}} groundwater provenance in the dune fields and of the recharge processes away from the dune slack floors. Preliminary results are described. Further data are still awaited and will be incorporated in a future report. A way forward is described which will deliver peer reviewed papers on the deep drilling work at Braunton, a paper on work at Whiteford and detailed investigation funded largely by Natural England and CEH at four new sites. These sites are likely to include two acid coastal dunes on the North Sea Coast, which will contrast with the alkaline sites on the west coast, one in Cumbria and one elsewhere...|$|E
