5|$|By 1951, Dawson Creek {{had more}} than 3,500 residents. In 1952, the John Hart Highway linked the town {{to the rest of}} the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains; a new {{southbound}} route, known locally as Tupper Highway, made the town a crossroads with neighbouring Alberta. The next year, western Canada's largest <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> plant was built and federal government offices were established in town. In 1958, the extension of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed, and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled. The RCAF center reemerged on 1 October 1956 and was declared functional in 1958. It was disbanded a final time in March 1964.|$|E
25|$|Propane is {{a cleaner}} burning, high {{performance}} fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified <b>propane</b> <b>gas),</b> LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel {{and is a}} member of the natural gas family.|$|E
25|$|Propane and butane are gases at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{that can be}} liquefied at fairly low pressures and {{are commonly known as}} liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Propane is used in <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.|$|E

25|$|The Falk Corporation {{explosion}} {{refers to}} a large and fatal <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> explosion at a Falk Corporation building in the industrial Menomonee River Valley neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, on December 6, 2006. Three {{people were killed and}} forty-seven others injured. Cars were reportedly flipped through the air and debris scattered over several blocks. An investigation of the cause of the disaster uncovered leaks in a pipe running below the building, which supplied propane to the heating system for the complex. Several parties involved in the explosion have launched legal action in connection to the accident.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the dry {{and liquid}} bulk {{segments}} have generated {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and liquid goods, such as chemical products, <b>propane</b> <b>gas,</b> crude oil, and oil derivatives. Recently, containerized cargo has replaced dry bulk as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the liquid bulk segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E
25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal grate with {{parallel bars}} typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or <b>propane</b> <b>gas.</b> The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|E

25|$|Work on the John F. Kennedy burial site {{continued}} {{over the}} next two and a half years. The Washington Gas and Light Company offered to build, maintain, and supply gas to the eternal flame at no expense. The final burner was a specially designed torch created by the Institute of Gas Technology with an electrical ignition which kept the flame lit in wind or rain and which fed the gas oxygen to create the correct color. A debate broke out between providers of bottled <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> and line-fed natural gas as to which source of fuel should be used to supply the eternal flame. The debate was so vigorous that it broke out in public in March 1964. The cost of construction of the approaches, elliptical plaza, walls were estimated at $1.77 million in February 1965. The cost of construction of the actual grave site was estimated at $309,000. Fifteen firms were invited to bid on the construction contract and nine did so. A $1.4 million contract for construction was awarded to Aberthaw Construction in mid-July 1965. The Army Corps of Engineers consulted with the Kennedy family before letting the award. A second contract for structural design consulting in the amount of $71,026 went to Ammann & Whitney. At this time, contracts for the quotation inscriptions, the marble base for the flame, the bronze brazier, and the slate markers had yet to be let. The white marble for the plaza, terrace, and steps came from Proctor, Vermont, and the granite for the approaches came from Deer Isle, Maine.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dark green}} Jeep Cherokee, {{registration}} number L808 RDT, travelling {{at a speed}} estimated by a witness as about 30mph (48km/h), struck security bollards in a terror ramming attack at the main entrance to Glasgow Airport. The vehicle {{was reported to have}} several petrol containers and <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> canisters on board. One eyewitness said flames issued from beneath the car when it hit the building, while another eyewitness said it appeared the driver was trying to drive through the terminal doors. According to reports, the car was occupied by two [...] "Asian-looking" [...] men. When the Jeep failed to explode, one man (later identified as Abdulla) threw petrol bombs from the passenger seat and the other (Ahmed) doused himself in petrol and set it alight. Police indicated the vehicle burst into flames when it was driven at the terminal. An eyewitness noted that a man {{got out of the car}} and began to fight with police. Another eyewitness said that the man was throwing punches and repeatedly shouting [...] "Allah". The man was arrested and later identified as Bilal Abdulla, a UK-born doctor of Iraqi descent who was working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Another man exited the car and ran into the terminal building while he was on fire and began writhing on the ground, before being kicked in the testicles by an airport employee, John Smeaton, who was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his heroism. Sky News reported that petrol was spread from containers by the occupants when they got out of the car. During the subsequent investigation <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> canisters were removed from the car. A Strathclyde Police spokesman confirmed the two men in the car were arrested, one of them badly burned. The man was initially taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary due to it having a specialist burns unit, where he died on 2 August. The Jeep was removed early on the morning of Sunday 1 July before flights resumed and the airport was partially reopened.|$|E
2500|$|A full {{investigation}} was launched into the accident by several government agencies, {{as well as}} legal representatives {{for the families of}} the deceased. The investigation determined that the leak was initially discovered by employees of the contractor J.M. Brennan Inc., who helped maintain plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation equipment at the plant. These four employees noticed <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> pooling as Falk employees started the propane system, which the factory uses as a backup fuel supply when natural gas is shut down during peak demand. These employees alerted other workers to the problem. There had been testing conducted on the system for a full 40minutes prior to the explosion. It is also thought the leak came from an underground pipe that ran from propane tanks to the propane/air mixers, which convert the liquid propane into gaseous form, so that it is in a form usable by the boilers. This is backed up by the discovery of a small pocket of gas trapped below asphalt directly below the Annex building. Pressure testing of the pipe using nitrogen has since confirmed it was leaking. Subsequent excavation showed it had two separate leaks; [...] Metallurgists have examined the damaged sections of pipeline and determined that the pipe corroded. Falk's evacuation procedure will also feature prominently in the investigation.|$|E
