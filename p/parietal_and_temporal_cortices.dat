Another approach to this discussion has been covered under the topic heading of [...] "bottom-up" [...] versus [...] "top-down" [...] orientations to attention. Researchers of this school have described two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment. The first aspect is called bottom-up processing, also known as stimulus-driven attention or exogenous attention. These describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects themselves. Some processes, such as motion or a sudden loud noise, can attract our attention in a pre-conscious, or non-volitional way. We attend to them whether we want to or not. These aspects of attention are thought to involve <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices,</b> as well as the brainstem.|$|E

These experiences would only last as long as the electrode stimulations were present on the cortex, and in some cases when patient experienced hallucinatory experiences that evoked certain smells, sensations of flashing light, stroking the back of their hand, and many others. Other stimulations had patients experiencing deja vu, fear, loneliness, and strangeness. Certain areas of patients' temporal lobes were stimulated with an electrode in order to experience past memories. Penfield called these perceptual illusions (physical hallucinations) interpretive responses.

40|$|SummaryThe {{senses of}} owning a body and being {{localized}} somewhere in space are two key components of human self-consciousness. Despite a wealth of neurophysiological and neuroimaging research on the representations of the spatial environment in the <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> medial <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices,</b> the relationship between body ownership and self-location remains unexplored. To investigate this relationship, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to manipulate healthy participants’ perceived self-location, head direction, and sense of body ownership during high-resolution fMRI. Activity patterns in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and intraparietal cortices reflected the sense of self-location, whereas the sense of body ownership was associated with premotor-intraparietal activity. The functional interplay between these two sets of areas was mediated by the posterior cingulate cortex. These results extend {{our understanding of the}} role of the posterior <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> medial <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices</b> in spatial cognition by demonstrating that these areas not only are important for ecological behaviors, such as navigation and perspective taking, but also support the perceptual representation of the bodily self in space. Our results further suggest that the posterior cingulate cortex has a key role in integrating the neural representations of self-location and body ownership...|$|R

We show that the AON "ticks together" in human subjects who are sharing a third person's feelings. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 volunteers watched movies depicting boxing matches passively or while simulating a prespecified boxer's feelings. Instantaneous intersubject phase synchronization (ISPS) was computed to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity of hemodynamic activity and inter-area functional connectivity.

Diffusion tensor imaging was completed on 41 participants (11 pediatric hemiplegia, 10 adult hemiplegia, 10 pediatric control and 10 adult control). Fractional anisotropy values and cross-sectional areas for five regions of the corpus callosum were compared between subject groups. Additionally, the amount of involuntary activity in the paretic elbow was quantified during non-paretic elbow flexion tasks for a subset of pediatric hemiplegia participants. Fractional anisotropy values were reduced in pediatric hemiplegia compared to pediatric control subjects in callosal regions corresponding to premotor and supplementary motor areas, primary sensory cortex, <b>and</b> <b>parietal,</b> <b>temporal,</b> <b>and</b> occipital <b>cortices.</b> Differences in fractional anisotropy between adult stroke and adult controls were only found in the region corresponding to <b>parietal,</b> <b>temporal,</b> <b>and</b> occipital <b>cortices.</b> Cross-sectional area was affected in all regions of the corpus callosum in pediatric hemiplegia, but only in the primary sensory region in adult hemiplegia. Additionally, changes in the cross-sectional areas were correlated with involuntary mirror movements in the pediatric hemiplegia group. In conclusion, the corpus callosum is affected to a greater extent in pediatric compared to adult hemiplegia, which may explain why unsuppressed mirror movements and difficulty with bimanual coordination are greater problems in this population...|$|R

Seven women with PCOS were compared to eleven healthy female controls of similar age, education and body mass index. Regional brain glucose uptake was quantified using FDG with dynamic positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and its potential relationship with insulin resistance assessed using the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA 2 -IR). A battery of cognitive tests was administered to evaluate working memory, attention and executive function. The PCOS group had 10 % higher fasting glucose and 40 % higher HOMA 2 -IR (p ≤ 0. 035) compared to the Controls. The PCOS group had 9 - 14 % lower CMRglu in specific regions of the frontal, <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices</b> (p ≤ 0. 018). A significant negative relation {{was found between the}} CMRglu and HOMA 2 -IR mainly in the frontal, <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices</b> {{as well as in the}} hippocampus and the amygdala (p ≤ 0. 05).

The PCOS group exhibited a pattern of low regional CMRglu that correlated inversely with HOMA 2 -IR in several brain regions and which resembled the pattern seen in aging and early Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that a direct association between mild insulin resistance and brain glucose hypometabolism independent of overweight or obesity can exist in young adults in their 20 s. Further investigation of the influence of insulin resistance on brain glucose metabolism and cognition in younger and middle-aged adults is warranted...|$|E

This memory system underlies our ability to identify objects in perception, to refer to things in language, and to engage in complex cognitive processes like imagination and reasoning. How such conceptual memories are encoded in the brain remains unclear.

I found that conceptual memories are represented in networks of modality-specific and heteromodal association regions of the brain.

In addition to white matter SV 40 distribution in classic demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, some of the 21 monkeys exhibited meningeal, subpial neocortical, and periventricular virus. This distribution pattern corresponded to broader viral tropism with neuronal infection in 14 (66. 7 %) of 21 cases.

Future studies, including {{the determination of the}} epitope of Mab 676, will give us a clue for understanding neurotrophic roles of this factor in the brain...|$|E
40|$|Thirty‐eight {{patients}} with {{mild to moderate}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent a neuropsychological test battery and 18 ‐fluoro‐ 2 ‐deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) before beginning {{and at the end}} of a randomized double‐blind study of an experimental treatment. Twelve of the patients took placebo. In the placebo patients, Mini‐Mental State (MMS) score decreased and cortical metabolism increased significantly over the 6 ‐month course of the study. Correlations of metabolism with neuropsychological performance were stable over time in the placebo group. Cortical metabolism correlated significantly with performance on the Blessed Information Subtest and the MMS and showed trend correlations with performance on the WAIS Digit Symbol and Word Fluency. Patients with high relative occipital metabolism tended to do poorly on word fluency. Low baseline relative metabolism in right frontal cortex and high baseline relative metabolism in left <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices</b> and in right occipital cortex predicted more 6 ‐month deterioration on the World Fluency Test, suggesting that frontal metabolic deficits may precede neuropsychological deficits. Correlations of 6 ‐month change in MMS, Blessed and Digit Symbol performance with initial glucose metabolism were not significant. Copyright © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCreativity is {{of central}} {{importance}} for human civilization, yet its neurocognitive bases are poorly understood. The {{aim of the}} present study was to integrate existing functional imaging data by using the meta-analysis approach. We reviewed 34 functional imaging studies that reported activation foci during tasks assumed to engage creative thinking in healthy adults. A coordinate-based meta-analysis using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) first showed a set of predominantly left-hemispheric regions shared by the various creativity tasks examined. These regions included the caudal lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), the medial and lateral rostral PFC, <b>and</b> the inferior <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> posterior <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices.</b> Further analyses showed that tasks involving the combination of remote information (combination tasks) activated more anterior areas of the lateral PFC than tasks involving the free generation of unusual responses (unusual generation tasks), although both types of tasks shared caudal prefrontal areas. In addition, verbal and non-verbal tasks involved the same regions in the left caudal prefrontal, <b>temporal,</b> <b>and</b> <b>parietal</b> areas, but also distinct domain-oriented areas. Taken together, these findings suggest that several frontal and parieto-temporal regions may support cognitive processes shared by diverse creativity tasks, and that some regions may be specialized for distinct types of processes. In particular, the lateral PFC appeared to be organized along a rostro-caudal axis, with rostral regions involved in combining ideas creatively and more posterior regions involved in freely generating novel ideas...|$|R
40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the phenomenology of schizophrenia maps onto diffuse alterations in large-scale functional and structural brain networks. However, the relationship between structural and functional deficits remains unclear. To answer this question, patients with established schizophrenia and matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional and diffusion weighted imaging. The network-based statistic was used to characterize between-group differences in whole-brain functional connectivity. Indices of white matter integrity were then estimated to assess the structural correlates of the functional alterations observed in patients. Finally, group differences in the relationship between indices of functional and structural brain connectivity were determined. Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia showed decreased functional connectivity and impaired white matter integrity in a distributed network encompassing frontal, <b>temporal,</b> thalamic, <b>and</b> striatal regions. In controls, strong interregional coupling in neural activity was associated with well-myelinated white matter pathways in this network. This correspondence between structure and function appeared to be absent in patients with schizophrenia. In two additional disrupted functional networks, encompassing <b>parietal,</b> occipital, <b>and</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices,</b> the relationship between function and structure was not affected. Overall, results from this study highlight the importance of considering not only the separable impact of functional and structural connectivity deficits on the pathoaetiology of schizophrenia, but also the implications of the complex nature of their interaction. More specifically, our findings support the core nature of fronto-striatal, fronto-thalamic, and fronto-temporal abnormalities in the schizophrenia connectome...|$|R
40|$|Selective spatial {{attention}} {{is fundamental to}} our ability to interact with our world. fMRI research of healthy participants suggests the dorsal posterior parietal cortex, in particular the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is involved in selection between stimuli in opposite hemifields. Whereas, lesion studies of stroke patients with visual extinction implicate the right inferior <b>parietal</b> <b>and</b> superior <b>temporal</b> <b>cortices</b> are critical for this function. To test if the middle horizontal segment of the IPS is critical for selection between stimuli in opposite hemifields, we induced a “temporary lesion” in this area using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twelve participants preformed a behavioural task in which an instructive cue directed attention to a visual quadrant. After a delay, participants made {{a response to the}} orientation of the target presented in the cued quadrant. Single-pulse TMS was applied 150 ms post-target presentation. In some trials an uncued distracter was presented either along the horizontal meridian in the opposite hemifield (bilateral trials) or along the vertical meridian in the same hemifield as the target (unilateral trials). Our first hypothesis was an overall interference effect when a distracter was presented with the target (bilateral and unilateral trials compared to single trials). Our second hypothesis was an increased interference effect for contralateral TMS targets compared to ipsilateral TMS targets, in bilateral compared to unilateral trials when TMS was applied to the left and right IPS. Results supported our first prediction but did not support our second prediction...|$|R
