40|$|The Generalized Waring Distribution is a {{discrete}} distribution {{with a wide}} spectrum of applications in areas such as accident statistics, income analysis, environmental statistics etc. It {{has been used as a}} model that better describes such practical situations as opposed to the Poisson Distribution or the Negative Binomial Distribution. Associated to both the Poisson and The Negative Binomial distributions are the well known Poisson and <b>Pólya</b> <b>Processes.</b> In this paper the Generalized Waring Process is defined. Two models have been shown to lead to the Generalized Waring process. One is related to a Cox Process while the other is a Compound Poisson Process. The defined Generalized Waring process is shown to be a stationary but non-homogenous Markov process. Several properties are studied and the intensity, the individual intensity, the Chapman-Kolmogorov differential equations of it, are obtained. Moreover, the Poisson and the <b>Pólya</b> <b>processes</b> are shown to arise as special cases of the Generalized Waring process.

In establishing its definition, the structural properties of both the bivariate and the multivariate versions of the generalized Waring distribution played a significant role. This process, analogously to the case of Poisson and <b>Pólya</b> <b>processes,</b> which can be obtained as limiting cases of it, was shown to be a Markov process.|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{data sets}} can be {{analysed}} by counting {{the number of}} objects in equally sized bins. The bin counts are related to the <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>process,</b> where coloured balls (for example, white or black) are removed from the urn at random. If there are insufficient white or black balls for the prescribed number of trials, the <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>process</b> becomes untenable. In this case, we modify the <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>process</b> so that it continues to describe the removal of volume within a spatial distribution of objects. We determine when the standard formula for the variance of the standard Pólya distribution gives a good approximation to the true variance. The variance quantifies an index for assessing whether a spatial point data set is at its most randomly distributed state, called the complete spatial randomness (CSR) state. If the bin size is an order of magnitude larger than the size of the objects, then the standard formula for the CSR limit is indicative of when the CSR state has been attained. For the special case when the object size divides the bin size, the standard formula is in fact exact. Benjamin J. Binder, Emily J. Hackett-Jones, Jonathan Tuke And Kerry A. Landma...|$|R

40|$|Cumulative {{advantage}} (CA) {{refers to}} the notion that accumulated resources foster the accumulation of further resources in competitions, a phenomenon that has been empirically observed in various contexts. The oldest and arguably simplest mathematical model that embodies this general principle is the <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>process,</b> which finds applications in a myriad of problems. The original model captures the dynamics of competitions between two equally fit agents under linear CA effects, which can be readily generalized to incorporate different fitnesses and nonlinear CA effects. We study two statistics of competitions under the generalized model, namely duration (i. e., time of the last tie) and intensity (i. e., number of ties). We give rigorous mathematical characterizations of the tail distributions of both duration and intensity under the various regimes for fitness and nonlinearity, which reveal very interesting behaviors. For example, fitness superiority induces much shorter competitions in the sublinear regime while much longer competitions in the superlinear regime. Our findings can shed light on the application of <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>processes</b> in more general contexts where fitness and nonlinearity may be present...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{co-ordination}} is {{the result}} of dynamical processes enabling independent agents to coordinate their actions without the need of a central co-ordinator. In the past few years, several computational models have illustrated the role played by such dynamics for self-organizing communication systems. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} agents could bootstrap shared convention systems based on simple local adaptation rules. Such models have played a pivotal role for our understanding of emergent language processes. However, only few formal or theoretical results have been published about such systems. Deliberately simple computational models are discussed in this paper in order to make progress in understanding the underlying dynamics responsible for distributed coordination and the scaling laws of such systems. In particular, the paper focuses on explaining the convergence speed of those models, a largely under-investigated issue. Conjectures obtained through empirical and qualitative studies of these simple models are compared with results of more complex simulations and discussed in relation to theoretical models formalized using Markov chains, game theory and <b>Polya</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{suggested}} to forecast economic time series. This model incorporates some innovative ideas of Harrison and Stevens [20] for building into the forecasting process important external shocks to the systems. Thus {{the occurrence of}} possibly significant real-world events may cause {{a fundamental change in}} the time series in question. The Jeffreys-Savage (JS) Bayesian theory of hypothesis testing is used to test the hypothesis that a particular event has been such as to free the series from its immediate past behavior. When the event frees the series in this way, then we model the sequence of observations following such an event (until the next such event) as an exchangeable sequence. In the simplest case of 0 – 1 valued data, such as in recording {{the ups and downs of}} the value of a particular commodity or stock, our alternative hypothesis is a <b>Pólya</b> <b>process,</b> and the null hypothesis is a simple random walk (unit roots model) with p =. 50. Any exchangeable sequence is strictly stationary, and the observations in the <b>Polya</b> <b>process</b> are positively correlated, which can give rise to “explosive” behavior of the series at isolated time points. We then use the JS theory to predict future observations by taking a weighted average of the optimal predictions for each model, with weights given by the posterior probabilities of the hypotheses. Results of simulation studies are presented which compare the predictive performance of the fully Bayesian method based upon the JS theory with those based upon the “ p-value” or pre-test method. The de Finetti method for scoring predictions is used to assess their empirical performance. A theoretical methodology, which extends the “evaluation game” of Hill [28, 37], is developed for comparing predictors. ...|$|E

The long-range dependence of the FNBP, the short-range dependence of its increments and the infinite divisibility of the FPP and the FNBP are investigated. Also, the space fractional <b>Polya</b> <b>process</b> (SFPP) is defined by replacing the rate parameter λ by a gamma random variable {{in the definition of}} the space fractional Poisson process.

40|$|Path-dependent {{stochastic}} {{processes are}} often non-ergodic and observables {{can no longer}} be computed within the ensemble picture. The resulting mathematical difficulties pose severe limits to the analytical understanding of path-dependent processes. Their statistics is typically non-multinomial {{in the sense that the}} multiplicities of the occurrence of states is not a multinomial factor. The maximum entropy principle is tightly related to multinomial processes, non-interacting systems, and to the ensemble picture; It loses its meaning for path-dependent processes. Here we show that an equivalent to the ensemble picture exists for path-dependent processes, such that the non-multinomial statistics of the underlying dynamical process, by construction, is captured correctly in a functional that plays the role of a relative entropy. We demonstrate this for self-reinforcing <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>processes,</b> which explicitly generalise multinomial statistics. We demonstrate the adequacy of this constructive approach towards non-multinomial pendants of entropy by computing frequency and rank distributions of <b>Pólya</b> urn <b>processes.</b> We show how microscopic update rules of a path-dependent process allow us to explicitly construct a non-multinomial entropy functional, that, when maximized, predicts the time-dependent distribution function.
