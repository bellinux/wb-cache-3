5|$|On 1 June 1956, a {{production}} Victor XA917 flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded {{the speed of}} sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a high <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b> Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a sonic boom. The Victor maintained stability throughout the event. Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the sound barrier knowingly to demonstrate the Victor's superiority to the earlier V-bombers. The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the sound barrier at that time.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{made the}} worst {{start in the}} field because of an {{incorrect}} <b>power</b> <b>setting,</b> moving from ninth to 14th {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Heidfeld made four positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap Piquet led from teammate Turvey, who was followed in turn, by Bird, Buemi, López, Heidfeld, Rosenqvist, Duval, Vergne, Abt, Engel, Félix da Costa, Evans, Prost, Sarrazin, Carroll, di Grassi, d'Ambrosio, Frijns and Ma. Piquet pulled away from the rest of the field as Buemi started to close the gap to Bird and Turvey. López fell down to eighth on the second lap after he was overtaken by Mahindra drivers Heidfeld and Rosenqvist along with Duval. Both di Grassi and Abt were shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring the pair to make pit stops for repairs to their cars. Ma switched to a second car but became the race's first retirement shortly afterwards because of an battery issue. Bird placed Turvey under pressure which allowed Piquet to open up a two-second advantage by lap four. Di Grassi moved to the outside line heading into the chicane on the fifth lap and overtook Sarrazin and López leaving the turn and moved in front of Carroll heading into the second corner. Bird overtook Turvey for the second position on lap six, and Buemi overtook Turvey by taking the inside lane in turn one on the following lap.|$|E
25|$|In July 1948, Major Townsend {{started as}} the lead {{military}} pilot for the Air Force evaluation of the Boeing B-47 jet bomber. A result of B-47's sleek design, the aircraft required a high landing speed and an excessively long distance to stop. Townsend suggested {{the addition of a}} parachute, deployed shortly before touch-down, to shorten the landing distance. Equally dangerous, landing at a reduced engine <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> left the pilot unable to quickly command additional thrust due to the slow acceleration characteristics of early jet engines. A fellow B-47 test pilot, Major Russell E. Schleeh, proposed a second parachute, deployed while in the landing pattern, to permit a higher engine <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> during the approach.|$|E

25|$|Continued {{development}} of the O-1230 reached its peak when the engine was rated at over 1200hp. It was as powerful as the Allison V-1710, but with a narrower cowling than the Allison V12 engine. The O-1230 was not well received by aircraft manufacturers, {{because it was not}} very reliable at that <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
25|$|This is {{the final}} variant developed. The AI-20DM is {{essentially}} the same with the AI-20D series 5, the only difference being in the <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b> The AI-20DM is derated to 4,750 shp (take-off power) which allows the engine to have extended life and increased TBO. The Time before overhaul (TBO) is consequently increased to 8000 hrs with a Service life of 22,000 hrs.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic pitch trim system to coordinate horizontal stabilizer angle of incidence with <b>power</b> <b>setting.</b> This system was later replaced by a vectored thrust nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|E

25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached Kaimana, the Captain gave several {{instructions to the}} First Officer related to the direction, speed, altitude and <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> of {{the aircraft}}.

The action of the Captain may have created additional workload to the Captain and reduced his situational awareness.|$|E

500|$|From late 1939, 100 octane fuel became {{available}} from the U.S., West Indies, Persia, and, in smaller quantities, domestically, consequently, [...] "...in {{the first half of}} 1940 the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel." [...] Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines, allowing an increased (emergency) boost pressure of +12 pounds per square inch (183kPa; 1.85atm). At this <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> these engines were able to produce 1,310 horsepower (977kW) at [...] while running at 3,000 revolutions per minute. Increased boost could be used indefinitely as there was no mechanical time limit mechanism but pilots were advised not to use increased boost for more than a maximum of five minutes and it was considered a [...] "definite overload condition on the engine"; if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing, when it was noted in the engine log book, while the engineering officer was required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate. Later versions of the Merlin ran only on 100 octane fuel and the five-minute combat limitation was raised to +18 pounds per square inch (224kPa; 2.3atm).|$|E

2500|$|Bleed air {{produced}} by gas turbine engines is compressed air that {{is taken from}} the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least [...] "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low <b>power</b> <b>setting</b> operations." [...] Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as [...] "customer bleed air". Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce {{was also}} working {{on a series of}} triple-spool designs as {{replacements}} for the Conway, which promised to deliver higher efficiencies. In this configuration, three groups of turbines spin three separate concentric shafts to power three sections of the compressor area running at different speeds. In addition to allowing each stage of the compressor to run at its optimal speed, the triple-spool design is also more compact and rigid, although more complex to build and maintain. Several designs were being worked on at the time, including a 10,000lbf (44kN) thrust design [...] known as the RB203 intended to replace the Rolls-Royce Spey.
