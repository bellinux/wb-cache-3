50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the enrollees {{in the first year}} high school for the next school year, an additional classroom was built. Through the efforts of Fr. Leon Hugo, Sor Cristina and Sor Joaquina, the La Consolacion Academy Parents-Teachers Association known as LACAPTA was organized. This association launched a fund-raising campaign and made possible the construction of the building.Meantime, gradually the school’s population increased and by 1954, La Consolacion Academy turned out its first batch of exclusive female high school graduates. Since then, with Sor Esperanza Molina, OSA, Sor Consolacion Alvarez, OSA and Sor Adelina Segismundo, OSA, as the respective Schoolheads, the school year’s 1954-1955 to the early 60’s were devoted to the improvement of the school’s physical structures and the acquisition of the basic school facilities and needs. These years also witnessed the active participation of the school in the prestigious Bicol Association of Catholic Schools (BACS) Meet and in holding grandiose annual plays.Sor Victorina de la Providencia’s term witnessed the beginning of the WAS and the majorettes. 1966-1967 and the immediate years that followed featured the victory of the Scouting Movement and the Drum and Bugle Corps in regional competitions. Furthermore, to answer the immediate needs of Iriga for a private sectarian school for boys, La Consolacion Academy opened its doors for a co-educational setting in high school in the school year 1970-1971.La Consolacion Academy celebrated its Silver Jubilee in the school year 1973-1974. With Sister Esperanza Magana, OSA as Schoolhead, again the school launched a fund-raising drive through the Mr. and Ms. Silver Jubilee.School year 1974-1975 featured the start of new programs such as the LCA Credit Cooperatives, the Guidance Program and the Christian Neighborhood Communities. With Sister Constancia Benares, OSA as the Schoolhead, the school carved its name in the division and regional competitions on academics and literary-musical activities where both the public and the private schools merged under the new MECS structure. The years that followed under Sister Consolata Dalisay, OSA and Sister Florina Lacuarta, OSA witnessed the continuance of the new programs.It was in the school year 1979-1980 with Sister Adelina Segismundo, OSA as Schoolhead when the Parents’ Homeroom Organization began.With Sister Ma. Celia Bayona, OSA as Schoolhead, 1981-1982 featured the start of the Catholic School Systems Development Program or the CS-SD with Mr. Feliciano Jimenez as Consultant. Aside from the development of persons and structures, the new program’s main contribution was the decentralization of authority in school where for the first time lay administrators were appointed to the school’s varied offices.In answer to the ever-growing population and through a loan, a new concrete building was constructed just behind the templete in the school year 1983-1984. The school likewise experienced its first external evaluation via the Congregational Evaluation Visit or CEV in February 1984. Given the signal to apply for external accreditation, La Consolacion Academy underwent a <b>Pre-Survey</b> by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) in the grade school and high school departments in March, 1987.Sister Ana Isabel Marcelo, OSA acted as the Principal in school year 1987-1988. With Sister Editha Zerna, OSA as Schoolhead in 1988-1989, the school celebrated its Ruby Anniversary. Massive fund-raising drives were held to support the school’s on-going construction plan. Alongside this growth in physical structures was the school’s academic growth. In April, 1991 the Grade School was granted its initial accreditation status by PAASCU while the High School followed suit in April, 1992. With both the grade school and the high school fully accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), the school ventured on the opening of collegiate courses. In response to the city’s need for a private sectarian college, the following initial courses were offered in school year 1992-1993: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education, two-year courses in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Tourism and Computer Technology. Thus, in September, 1992 from La Consolacion Academy, the school has become La Consolacion College. In school year 1994-1995, Sister Esperanza Magana, OSA became President and Schoolhead. Answering the call for lay empowerment, the first Lay Principal for the Basic Education Department - Dr. Gloria C. Pasco was appointed in the same school year. The school’s option for the poor was made more concrete {{with the opening of the}} Free High School for the indigents. Meantime, alongside the school’s on-going construction were the PAASCU re-accreditation surveys. The Grade School was Re-Surveyed in January, 1995 and was granted a five-year PAASCU re-accreditation status. The High School had its Re-Survey in October, 1996 and was likewise given a five-year PAASCU re-accreditation status. The school had its first college graduates in March, 1995. In preparation for the school’s Golden Jubilee in 1999, La Consolacion College undertook some projects as the school’s gift to the community on its fiftieth (50th) year. It offered free pilinut seedlings for planting. It conducted tree-planting activities at Maryhill Settlement in San Pedro, Iriga City. It adopted a new barangay - San Vicente Sur, Iriga City for its outreach program and a cooperative was formed in San Vicente Nabua, Camarines Sur. Moreover, free medical missions were conducted and in April, 1997 a Free Summer Nursery class began.|$|E
30|$|In this research, {{in-depth}} {{interview was}} conducted with semi-constructed questionnaires. Researchers recruited interview participants by conducting <b>pre-survey</b> on North Korean defector’s online community websites. The <b>pre-survey</b> included 14 questions about North/South Korean clothing culture, 2 questions for demographic information and 1 question to ask to participate in in-depth interview. The online <b>pre-survey</b> had been conducted from October 4, 2016 to November 16, 2016. In total, 30 random North Korean female defectors in South Korea participated in the <b>pre-survey,</b> and 11 of them showed will to join to the in-depth interview. Semi-constructed questionnaire for in-depth interview was made of two parts: first, since every interviewee {{had participated in the}} <b>pre-survey,</b> researchers used <b>pre-survey</b> response of each participant. Second, Researchers prepared additional questionnaires regarding their experiences about clothing culture of two Koreas and ideal fashion image in daily life. Both <b>pre-survey</b> and semi-constructed questionnaires for interview were based on previous researches related to acculturation and NK defectors (Forney 1980; Forney and Rabolt 1986; Park 1998; Shim and Chen 1996; Alkhazraji et al. 1997; Swaidan et al. 2006; Inglessis 2008; Keum 2015; Sohn 2013; Kim 2016).

40|$|Mobilization {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the outcomes of postoperative patients. Early mobilization as an intervention is the most significant general nursing measure in the prevention of complications. Current research demonstrates a decrease in complication rates, reported pain and length of stay when early ambulation is initiated. Despite this evidence, early mobilization as a best practice standard is implemented inconsistently on the women’s health unit of a community hospital. The purpose of this project was to improve nurses’ knowledge and attitudes of early mobilization of postoperative patients. The quality improvement project utilized a <b>pre-survey,</b> educational intervention, post-survey design. Twenty-five nurses (52 %) participated in the project. The educational intervention integrated knowledge obtained from the review of literature in the form of a 15 minute Power Point presentation. Pre/post-survey included knowledge-based questions and opinion-based questions. Overall, post-survey scores increased by 16. 8 % and knowledge were improved when compared to the <b>pre-survey.</b> Nurses’ opinion of the importance of mobilization improved from <b>pre-survey</b> to post-survey (�= 8 pre; �= 9. 44 post). Time and patient’s pain were noted as barriers to early mobilization. Minimal change in nurses’ opinion of these barriers was noted from <b>pre-survey</b> to post-survey (time: �= 5. 76 pre; �= 5. 68 post) (pain: �= 5. 56 pre; �= 5. 08 post).

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) as {{it stands}} today still exists in many violent cases involving intimate relationships. Intervention programs seek to address this issue, however, fails to meet their intended outcomes to reduce prevalence rates of IPV. The research study evaluated {{the use of a}} prevention program and measures its effectiveness among high school students. This study sought to explain IPV prevention programs, making it explanatory and necessitates a quantitative research design. This study used secondary data analysis to assess effectiveness of this particular prevention program. Data was collected from 130 high school students within the Inland Empire who completed <b>pre-surveys</b> and post-surveys. Through data analysis, the study found the prevention program was effective by increasing the high school students’ knowledge about local resources for those experiencing IPV, specifically where to go for help. Another key finding revealed a majority of the participants were able to correctly define types of relationships and communication styles. However, the prevention program does not necessarily assess for participants’ knowledge on how to address conflict in a healthy manner, as measured by questions asked within the <b>pre-surveys</b> and post-surveys. This is not to say this particular prevention program was not effective in some areas. Still, there is room for improvement as far as future research; collaboration with seasoned researchers, school administrators, and social workers; and policy recommendations on this topic of school-based IPV prevention programs...|$|R

30|$|Third, two surveys (a <b>pre-survey</b> and post-survey) {{collected}} student {{beliefs about}} mathematics and {{reactions to the}} tutoring agents. The <b>pre-survey</b> included four simple arithmetic problems (measured by speed of completion), the mathematical beliefs items from the Mathematical Problem-Solving Behaviors Scale (MPSB; Schommer-Aikins et al. 2005), and the Dweck scale for incremental and entity beliefs about intelligence (Blackwell et al. 2007). Dweck’s scale has indicated that incremental beliefs about intelligence (e.g., “I believe I can always substantially improve on my intelligence.”) tend {{to be associated with}} better learning outcomes, while entity beliefs about intelligence being fixed tend to be associated with worse outcomes (Blackwell et al. 2007). The MPSB items were collected to identify beliefs about mathematics that might influence their performance in ALEKS or interactions with the agent dialogs. The MPSB constructs are Effortful Math (EM), that math skills grow with effort, similar to Dweck’s incremental intelligence but specific to math; Useful Math (UM), that math will be valuable to them; Math Confidence (MC), their belief in being able to solve hard problems; Understand Math Concepts (UMC), that concepts rather than just finding the answer is important; Word Problems (WP), that word problems are important; and Non Prescriptive Math (NPM), that math problems are not just solved by memorizing fixed steps. Since some overlap existed between these scales, factor analysis was applied to identify factors from the <b>pre-survey</b> data.|$|E
40|$|Foot-mounted {{inertial}} sensors {{combined with}} GPS-receivers, magnetometers, and barometric pressure sensors have shown great potential in providing high-accuracy positioning systems for first responder and military applications. Several factors, including {{the type of}} movement, surface, and {{the shape of the}} trajectory, can strongly influence the performance of foot-mounted inertial navigation systems. There is a need for realistic scenario-based evaluations as a complement to the controlled environment tests that have been published in the literature. In this work we evaluate the performance of a foot-mounted inertial navigation system using three-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers during realistic scenario-based measurements. The position accuracy is evaluated by using a camera-based reference system which positions itself towards visual markers placed at <b>pre-surveyed</b> positions, using a slightly modified version of the ARToolKitPlus software. Maximum position errors of 2. 5 to 5. 5 meters were obtained during four separate high-tempo building clearing operations that lasted approximately three and a half minutes each. Further improvements in accuracy, as well as improved robustness towards different movement patterns, can be achieved by implementing an adaptive stand-still detection algorithm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review and {{determine}} the merits of training teacher credential candidates and educators already possessing credentials in general Assistive Technology applications and practices. The primary reasons this research is important are because special education students will be more successful accessing and using technology interventions when supported by teachers who have competence and confidence in using technology. Further, providing comprehensive training in AT enables educators to be highly qualified and well-rounded professionals who can be resources to other educators, related services personnel, families and administrators. To obtain quantitative and qualitative data on teacher competencies with regard to Assistive Technology, 24 educators from a Technology for Special Populations class were given a pre-and post-survey near the beginning and end of a course on AT to determine changes in confidence and competence as a result of participating in the course. The results from a comparison of the <b>pre-surveys</b> and post-surveys were significant. The results established conclusively the hypothesis that educator's competencies and confidence in their own abilities with AT would increase after several weeks of training in AT. Therefore, teachers would have a broader scope of knowledge and be able to support their students effectively.
