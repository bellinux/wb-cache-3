During this, Columbus is startled by the noises of a rat and accidentally shoots at the last {{remaining}} box of Twinkies in the pantry, destroying all the cakes and making them inedible.

500|$|Gates {{provided}} {{his perspective}} {{on a range}} of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, [...] Gates provided his perspective on [...] climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: [...] "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." [...] Gates also identified innovation as the [...] "real driver of progress" [...] and pronounced that [...] "America's way better today than it's ever been." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A Minor with a time {{signature}} in common time. Jackson's vocal range spans from G3 to C6. The track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute. [...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to answer right now,' he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving to <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are tough boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?" [...] in a repeating lyric in the song's chorus.|$|E
500|$|Two remixes of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] are {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The first, by the Super Furry Animals themselves, is 3 minutes 23 seconds in length and largely follows {{the arrangement of the}} original with lengthy instrumental passages between each verse and chorus. Electronic drums and keyboards play alongside Gruff Rhys's vocals with barely any recognisable instrumentation from the version of the track which appears on Rings Around the World. The second remix by Lesser is 3 minutes 22 seconds long and begins with a short sample of Rhys singing the words [...] "All the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hate" [...] before breaking down to finger clicking and clapping. Rhys's vocals enter again, singing the title phrase, before samples of the original's string section and drums enter at 1 minute 11 seconds. The rest of the track continues with Rhys's vocals backed by disjointed drum and string samples, breaking down towards the end to just the lead vocals and a harp. The remix ends with Rhys singing the line [...] "Til someone stole my name" [...] a cappella.|$|E
500|$|... "Juxtapozed with U" [...] is 3 minutes 8 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of A major. The track begins with a drum fill, {{featuring}} flanging, before a harp, strings, acoustic guitar and bass join at 2 seconds. An electric guitar joins at 13 seconds playing a melody line. The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a vocoder. The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words [...] "You've got to tolerate all those <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hate, I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you" [...] twice without the use of a vocoder. The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you" [...] supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words [...] "Let's get juxtaposed" [...] backed only by harmony vocals.|$|E

500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some <b>People,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 June 2014, Azalea {{confirmed}} {{an accompanying}} [...] for the song, stating, [...] "We're gonna {{have a very}} crazy music video, {{with a lot of}} other <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> guys may know, playing different characters. I'm really excited about it." [...] Ora also talked about preparing for the video in June, [...] "It is going to be amazing; I can't even tell you what's going to happen because I am sworn to secrecy. It is going to be major. You've seen her video for [...] "Fancy"? She loves a theme and the theme for this one is fucking genius. All I am saying is I am in training for days for this video." [...] The video was shot in mid-July in Los Angeles. On 8 August 2014 during a performance, Ora announced that the video should premiere officially on 11 August 2014. On 11 August 2014, a 16-second teaser for [...] "Black Widow" [...] was uploaded on Azalea's VEVO channel. The video was directed by Director X and Iggy Azalea and premiered through VEVO on 13 August 2014. Daps was the second unit director for the music video. American actors Michael Madsen, Paul Sorvino, and actor/rapper T.I. also appear in the video. On 14 August 2014, exclusive behind-the-scenes footage from the video set was shown on the second episode of MTV's show House of Style, hosted by Azalea and where she revealed the visuals are inspired by 70s kung fu films and Tarantino movies.|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

2500|$|About {{his work}} in First Amendment speech cases, Greenwald told Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in 2013, [...] "to me, it's a heroic attribute to be so committed to a principle that you apply it not when it's easy...not when it supports your position, not when it protects people you like, but when it defends and protects <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hate".|$|E
2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Slug's lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug {{is in the}} song [...] "Woman with the Tattooed Hands", which he has said is [...] "a metaphor for that same old shit that everybody has already made songs about. Just trying to find your place within a belief and faith as well as <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{want to have sex}} with." [...] Further examples come in the song [...] "Abusing of the Rib" [...] from {{it has been said that}} the [...] "lover" [...] Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release Sad Clown Bad Dub II, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album's penultimate track [...] "The River." ...|$|E

2500|$|To the British {{newspaper}} The Guardian, Arena {{describes herself}} as somebody with [...] "certain points on the board" [...] - {{someone who has been}} [...] "tenacious, resilient, hung around for a long time" [...] and [...] "done everything in their power to hone their craft". It is from the place – as one of Australia's great musical dames – that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. [...] "I've struggled with the phantasmal aspect that {{has been a part of}} what we do" [...] she says. [...] "The fact that it has been really glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well. Thus, she argues that the music industry has been peddling shoddy wares, saying [...] "It's a business template they’ve used. They've told <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be a star and sold that dream to everybody. I think it's been a huge irresponsibility".|$|E

[...] In the aftermath of the [...] "Secret Wars" [...] storyline, the Thing is working with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Human Torch is acting as an ambassador with the Inhumans. With Franklin's powers restored and Reed having absorbed the power of the Beyonders from Doom, the Richards family is working on travelling through and reconstructing the multiverse, but Peter Parker has purchased the Baxter Building to keep it [...] "safe" [...] until the team is ready to come back together.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, many {{teachers}} of English still admonish students against using split infinitives in writing. Because the prohibition {{has become so}} widely known, the Columbia Guide recommends that writers [...] "follow the conservative path , especially when you're uncertain of your readers' expectations and sensitivities in this matter". Likewise, the Oxford Dictionaries do not regard the split infinitive as ungrammatical, but on balance consider it likely to produce a weak style and advise against its use for formal correspondence. [...] R. W. Burchfield's revision of Fowler's Modern English Usage goes farther (quoting Burchfield's own 1981 book The Spoken Word): [...] "Avoid splitting infinitives whenever possible, but do not suffer undue remorse if a split infinitive is unavoidable for {{the completion of a}} sentence already begun." [...] Still more strongly, the style guide of The Economist says, [...] "Happy the man who has never been told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless. Unfortunately, to see it broken is so annoying to so many <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should observe it." ...|$|E

Talking about her cover of the song Lee said: [...] "It's such a surreal thing watching other people perform your songs in the first place, but <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't even know on TV doing 'American Idol' and Paula Abdul commenting on {{it is just a}} whole other thing.

[...] Jim Cantiello of MTV News praised Glocksen's performance, saying that Glocksen [...] "could kick Amy Lee's butt in a cage match". DJ Nate, an American disc jockey, made a sped-up remix of the song in 2010 and included it on his album Da Trak Genious.
