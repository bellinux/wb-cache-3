Campaigns were also waged on moral grounds ranging from pacifist convictions to objections to the weapons being used to fight the war. In the early 1970s, anti-Vietnam war groups organised 'mobilisations', when thousands marched in protest against the war in all the country's major centres.

40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Since {{the start}} of the space race in the 1950 ‟s the outer space {{environment}} has significantly changed due to human expansion and the subsequent by-products known as outer space pollution/debris. As outer space rapidly evolved from a military high-ground into a commercialised asset exploited by private and state owned enterprises, the treaties negotiated in the 1960 ‟s and 1970 ‟s quickly became out-dated. As a result outer space, especially the orbits around the Earth are occupied by countless masses of non-functional manmade objects, some expected to remain for millions of years. This dissertation argues that the current national and international legal framework will be inadequate {{to address the problem of}} outer space pollution and that legal and political action will be necessary on a global scale. With the planned developments as set out in the National Space Policy, South Africa is set on becoming a leading provider of outer space services on the African continent and will, as a consequence, have a progressively bigger impact on the outer space environment. With a growing dependence on outer space technologies, developed and developing economies around the world cannot ignore the immense negative consequences that outer space debris could pose to their development. This study will thus, by examining the international and national legal framework regarding outer space pollution, provide legal recommendations pertaining to the <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> that the South African legal framework will have to make provision for, in order to minimise the negative effect on the outer space environment.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of my paper {{are to have}} better understanding about the spe­cific challenges of Catholic doctors and about their problems in considering every medical decision {{from the perspectives of}} Ethics and Bioethics, offer­ing some suggestions how to face them. It is a library research, a critical analysis of relevant sources on Ethics and Bioethics, to collect information related to the challenges and how to face them. The analysis revealed that Catholic doctors face three kinds of challenges related to Ethics. The first one is the Department's ambiguity towards the subjects of Medical Ethics since humanistic subjects do not have a strong position in the academic world. The second one is that Catholic doctors cannot develop themselves to become moral subjects since they are always struggling with moral questions: Which regulation or norm or principle do they have to comply with? The third one is that Ethics is facing the imbal­ anced development that modern Ethics is merely based on <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>obligations.</b> In relation to Bio-Ethics, the doctors also face three kinds of challenges. Firstly, Bioethics seems problematic to consider ethics as an applied science. Secondly, doctors are very much affected by empirical attitude. Thirdly, they have to face the death culture. It requires clear thinking that the doctors have to make time to reflect on Ethics and Bio-Ethics in order that they can rearrange the strategy that has been carried out, will be or are necessary to be done. In addition, there should be pluralistic dialogs among Ethics com­mittees to give profound ethical evaluation on basic matters. In conclusion, despite all the distractions, Catholic doctors should make time for reflection to make it a habit in considering their medical practices in view of Ethics and Bioethics that they may develop a rational morality and deepen their moral conscienc...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{principles}} {{and content of}} quality standards of social services are described in the law 108 / 2006, about social services, and in related notice 505 / 2006. There are described the most important <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> to provide social services by providers. Quality standards are a tool to achieve required level of services. They are also used as control mechanism for all of providers. These standards were released in 2002 and they started process of transformation some organizations. For this transformation are important a will of service provider and appropriate ammount of money to manage required changes. The quality standards are uniform tool for all of kinds of social services. It means to revise all of internal regulations of providing organizations. It means also to make emploees do along the new system. In the senior house in Sušice there was worked allong with these standards since the new legislation came into force. As a method were chosen conducted talks with clients and questionnaire for emploees. Althrow most of the clients are in serious health condition, they need care and help by personnel during whole day, conclusions in case of care were positive. All of the clients are satisfied with accomodation. Interesting is also the time of living there, 27 % of the clients live there more than 6 years. With sanitary care were satisfied 90 % of clients. Satisfaction of the clients with providing care means, that implementation of quality standards increases level of provided care.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the international, regional and domestic legal instruments for conserving and managing Pacific sea turtles through habitat protection and the regulation of bycatch and harvest. States are obliged to protect threatened wildlife such as turtles under a number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). An integrated and harmonised legal framework for protecting sea turtles is needed to provide states with the minimum legal standards for conservation and management. In the South Pacific, there is also no formalised regional arrangement that focuses on Pacific sea turtles. Regional cooperation is a priority for conserving Pacific turtles and there is the prospect {{for the development of a}} regional sea turtle agreement. In 2003, the Bellagio Blueprint for Action on Sea Turtles (hereafter, Bellagio Blueprint) was developed by 25 leading experts from leading institutions in the Pacific as a guideline on measures required for the conservation of Pacific sea turtles. The priority areas listed under the Bellagio Blueprint (bycatch minimisation, harvest limits, habitat protection and regional cooperation) provide distinct criteria for examining existing legal measures. A comparison of the different compliance regimes in the two case studies (Australia [Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Queensland) ] and Fiji), provide additional perspectives on developing and developed states in the regional governance framework. There are a number of <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>obligations</b> under various MEAs which can address priority areas in the Bellagio Blueprint. These international obligations may be implemented at regional or national levels in the context of turtles through their regulatory frameworks. This study reveals several gaps within the regulatory framework at all three levels that provide justification for a formalised South Pacific regional cooperation arrangement. The evaluation of the regional and national regulatory frameworks also revealed gaps similar to those found in the international framework. Areas for improvement include traditional turtle fisheries management and bycatch in coastal fisheries. Australia showed greater compliance with general obligations or principles in international law in the context of turtles compared with Fiji, but both states could improve their levels of compliance. A regional arrangement is needed for states to protect Pacific sea turtles in compliance with all applicable <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>obligations</b> under international law. This is because regional cooperation can address identified gaps. A regional arrangement can also improve integration and harmonisation of measures among states. Formalised regional arrangements need to be supported within the regional governance framework due to existing policies for cooperation that integrate regional priorities, such as sustainable development. Turtles need to be conserved in the South Pacific to maintain ecological and traditional sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} community has, rather recently, raised concern over biodiversity loss. Human impact is widely accepted {{as the main}} cause for mass extinction of species and the decrease of biodiversity results in drastic consequences for human societies. This thesis assesses how international law responds to this concern {{in the context of}} commercial seabed mining, under State jurisdiction. This particular activity was chosen, since the world’s first commercial seabed-mining project is commencing in the near future and, opposed to seabed mining on the high seas, the international law regulating the activity has not received attention in literature. The purpose of this thesis is to discover how international environmental law regulates activities that are potentially hazardous for unique ecosystems that thrive near hydrothermal vents. The study focuses on the responsibility of States allowing private companies to mine massive sulphide deposits under their jurisdiction. No specific rules govern this particular activity under international law. What follows is that the thesis analyses different sources of international environmental law in order to investigate what the responsibility of the State is. Three different approaches are used in the thesis. First, the activity is analysed according to international environmental customary law. The rules governing the activity are the no harm <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> the <b>obligation</b> to undertake an environmental impact assessment. In this context, the doctrine of State responsibility is of particular interest, since the activity itself is not prohibited under international law and a private company is performing the activity. The main finding here is that States have a due diligence obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm on their jurisdiction. This obligation requires the State to undertake an environmental impact assessment. Research conducted here regarding case law suggests that obscurity remains on when the obligation to assess is triggered and what the content of the assessment should be. The second approach considers if the rules of customary law are specified by environmental law treaties. The studied treaties were the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. The treaties do specify terms relevant to the research question and pose additional substantial requirements for the environmental impact assessment. However, the unclear aspects of the no harm <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> the <b>obligation</b> to undertake an environmental impact assessment influence both Conventions. The third approach addresses the status, content and application of the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is a highly debated <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> in this thesis one of the main questions is whether the principle has reached the status of customary law. The case law and literature provides for an uncertainty over the status of the <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> in this thesis it is approached as an emerging principle of international law. The contents and actuation of the precautionary principle suggest that the principle poses a stricter obligation to investigate possible harmful effects, which would be beneficial considering the high-risk nature of seabed mining, and the uncertainties of the effects on the environment. The main conclusion of this thesis is that the rules of international environmental law that have been analysed here are not defined in a manner that would effectively impose an obligation to preserve the ecosystems and species endangered by the activity...|$|R

Tocmo {{who were at}} loggerheads {{on the matter of}} school administration. From the pulpit, Fr Simeon lambasted the municipal administration and condemned the teachings in Corella schools as having originated from the mouth of hell. Enrollment in the school greatly diminished. Only close family friends and relatives of president Tocmo sent their children to school. The local civil administration complained to the provincial and national authorities. After a fact-finding investigation by the Department of Public Instruction whose report was submitted to the Governor-General, Fr Simeon was removed.|$|R

In 1920, lobbyists for the Sioux persuaded Congress to authorize a lawsuit against United States in the U.S. Claims Court to seek redress for grievances. In 1923, Chief Flying Hawk, with the support of McCreight, called upon the Council to file the case of United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians. In a later visit to The Wigwam, McCreight asked Flying Hawk about the status of the case. Flying Hawk appealed to his interpreter {{to make it clear that}} the treaty with Napoleon was broken at the time that his country was purchased, and that the whites had, from the beginning of relations with their tribe, ignored and wholly repudiated their first <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> <b>obligation</b> toward the Sioux.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the application}} of the 1972 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention (the WHC) {{in the context of the}} armed conflicts that have taken place in the Virunga National Park (the Park), a natural world heritage site in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC). Instead of addressing wartime environmental damage under the law of armed conflict, this article seeks to establish how such damage can be addressed using multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). MEAs often consist of general <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> vague <b>obligations</b> <b>and</b> their relevance or applicability during situations of armed conflict may be questioned. However, a number of MEAs, including the WHC, authorise their convention bodies to develop detailed <b>and</b> substantive <b>obligations</b> applicable to their parties. Thus, the decisions and recommendations adopted by the World Heritage Committee, a body established under the WHC, provide substantive content to the provisions of the WHC. These decisions and recommendations may, however, run counter to the requirements of military necessity thereby affecting {{the application of}} the law of armed conflict. While the position adopted by the World Heritage Committee does not inevitably imply a clash between the obligations in the WHC and the law of armed conflict, it does raise the question of whether the outstanding values of world heritage should trump the rules of military necessity and other pressing concerns during armed conflict. On an informal basis, the World Heritage Committee and the UN peacekeeping forces deployed in the DRC have agreed to perform operations that jointly address the interconnected concerns of security and conservation of natural resources in the region of the Park. This cooperative ‘green-keeping’ operation represents a useful approach to regime interaction and the harmonisation of obligations set out in different legal regimes that are applicable to the same subject matter...|$|R

Despite the different economic and welfare systems in the U. S. and Germany, common features were found {{with regard to the}} segregation of insured and uninsured respondents in both countries. Firstly, economic inequality causes an unequal access to certain insurance standards. Consequently, however, it is an unequal access to medical care that bringe about health handicaps for those unable to obtain better services. The existence of a social group of less healthy, poor and inadequately insured {{is going to be a}} challenge for the social policy also in our country. A specific problem is the distribution of health risks of an insurance company's clients among various subjects.

The language {{is based on a}} set of well-defined <b>principles,</b> <b>and</b> is designed to capture an agent’s rights, as derived from property, <b>and</b> an agent’s <b>obligations,</b> as derived from restrictions placed on its actions, either voluntarily or as a consequence of other ac-tions. Rights <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> are viewed as first-class goods, from which we define fundamental axioms about well-functioning market-oriented worlds. Coupled with the scripting language is a run-time system that is able to monitor and enforce rights <b>and</b> <b>obligations.</b> Our treatment ex-tends to represent a variety of market mechanisms, ranging from simple two-agent single-good exchanges to complicated combinatorial auctions. ...|$|R
