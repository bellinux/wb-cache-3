When prenatal or preconception diagnosis is requested, genetic counselling (GC) represents a key step for those who cope with reproductive choices (Kessler, 1997, 2001; Saviolo-Negrin, Cusinato, 1998; Kay, Kingston, 2002; Nusbaum et al., 2008; Uhlmann, Schuette, Yashar, 2009; Zaccaro, Freda, 2009), making the construction of parental pact (Scabini, Cigoli, 2000) more complex. In an ampler research project, this qualitative investigation focuses on the attitudes and motivations of counselees who attend {{for the first time a}} Centre of Cardiomyology and Medical Genetics in Naples in order to explore the system of significance about their request of GC and in order to relieve feelings of vulnerability. Transcripts of 15 semi-structured interviews (recorded and transcribed verbatim) are conducted in a pre-counseling setting and they are analysed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis-IPA (Smith, 1996). The results show that the request of GC is originated by several life events, considered as specific developmental tasks, which belong not only to the single/couple, but also to their families since they share the same pedigree. The emerging themes highlight how the awareness of the risk, the cognitive procession of medical information and the emotions, such as anxiety and guilt change on the basis of family transition and its developmental tasks (marriage, pregnancy project, reproductive failure and multiple miscarriages). These changes and the consequent choices are strictly linked to the different use of GC.

40|$|Abstract Background Large-scale {{statistical}} analyses have become hallmarks of <b>post-genomic</b> era biological <b>research</b> due to advances in high-throughput assays and {{the integration of}} large biological databases. One accompanying issue is the simultaneous estimation of p-values for {{a large number of}} hypothesis tests. In many applications, a parametric assumption in the null distribution such as normality may be unreasonable, and resampling-based p-values are the preferred procedure for establishing statistical significance. Using resampling-based procedures for multiple testing is computationally intensive and typically requires large numbers of resamples. Results We present a new approach to more efficiently assign resamples (such as bootstrap samples or permutations) within a nonparametric multiple testing framework. We formulated a Bayesian-inspired approach to this problem, and devised an algorithm that adapts the assignment of resamples iteratively with negligible space and running time overhead. In two experimental studies, a breast cancer microarray dataset and a genome wide association study dataset for Parkinson's disease, we demonstrated that our differential allocation procedure is substantially more accurate compared to the traditional uniform resample allocation. Conclusion Our experiments demonstrate that using a more sophisticated allocation strategy can improve our inference for hypothesis testing without a drastic increase in the amount of computation on randomized data. Moreover, we gain more improvement in efficiency when the number of tests is large. R code for our algorithm and the shortcut method are available at [URL]. </p...|$|R
