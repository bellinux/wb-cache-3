In this way, banks can develop their capacity to lend into new and potentially profitable markets while increasing the credit available to developing areas.

5000|$|Utility {{financing}}. Loan {{financing to}} PDAMs faces numerous challenges. For example, the Ministry of Finance requires its loans to be channeled through regional governments whose legislatures have to pledge future central government transfers as collateral. Since regional legislatures {{are reluctant to}} do so, central government lending to utilities {{is not likely to}} re-emerge even after the issue of old debt would be settled. Two efforts at promoting the issuing of corporate bonds by creditworthy utilities, one supported by <b>partial</b> <b>guarantees</b> by USAID and the other by KfW, have failed [...] "because of the risk-averse culture which is so pervasive in Indonesian central and regional governments", according to a USAID report. Under a 2009 Presidential decree, however, state banks can provide <b>partial</b> credit <b>guarantees</b> of 70% of loans to creditworthy PDAMs plus an interest subsidy. As for direct lending by the Ministry of Finance, regional governments have to provide <b>partial</b> <b>guarantees</b> for these loans, which they are reluctant to provide.|$|R

30|$|Transmission of {{the entire}} video traffic in one stream over CAPS. This method relies on informing the CAPS-enabled WLAN of the traffic pattern of the {{multimedia}} flows in order to guarantee required resources for them. Using this information CAPS enables the MAC layer to better serve the video streams; however, the application layer (video) actions are limited to tagging each video with a stream ID or a type of service tag, and further information of the delivery layer services are not used by the multimedia source. Since video traffic is variable bitrate (VBR), sometimes the video rate exceeds the reserved throughput. In this case, CAPS will provide <b>partial</b> <b>guarantee</b> and the extravideo bits are sent using EDCA. The same scenario occurs when the multirate operation forces a lower-guaranteed throughput for the video.|$|E

Instead of applying general-purpose techniques with only <b>partial</b> <b>guarantees</b> of success, it identifies restricted but reasonably expressive classes of applications and properties for which sound and complete verification can be performed in a fully automatic way. This leverages the emergence of high-level specification tools for database-centered applications that not only allow fast prototyping and improved programmer productivity but, as a side effect, provide convenient targets for automatic verification. We present theoretical and practical results on verification of database-driven systems. The results are quite encouraging and suggest that, unlike arbitrary software systems, significant classes of databasedriven systems may be amenable to automatic verification. This relies on a novel marriage of database and model checking techniques, of relevance to both the database and the computer aided verification communities. 1...|$|R

In this paper we use <b>Partial</b> Credit <b>Guarantee</b> Schemes in Chile to study how such a government intervention in the financial system can affect the access that entrepreneurs have to the formal financial system. We also explore how these schemes affect the default rates on the guaranteed loans. We find that <b>partial</b> credit <b>guarantee</b> schemes increase the number of loans and the aggregate amount lent to small and medium size businesses. In addition, we find that credit guarantees increase the debt capacity of individual entrepreneurs, holding assets fixed.

We find that during the period of transition from a blanket guarantee to a <b>partial</b> <b>guarantee,</b> weak banks suffered from a large outflow of partially insured time deposits. More importantly, we find that those weak banks were not able to raise a sufficient amount of other types of deposits {{to make up for the}} loss of time deposits, which, consequently, forced them to cut back on loan supply. These results are consistent with the theory that the imperfect substitutability of insured deposits and uninsured deposits affects the tightness of banks' financing constraints and ultimately the supply of bank loans.

40|$|<b>Partial</b> credit <b>guarantee</b> schemes have {{experienced}} renewed interest from governments keen to promote financial access for small enterprises, not least {{as a response}} to the credit crunch in advanced economies. While the market can find uses for <b>partial</b> credit <b>guarantees,</b> the attractions for public policy can be illusory: indeed their most attractive feature for myopic politicians may be the ease with which the true cost of guarantees can be understated, at least at the outset. In practice, the actual fiscal cost of existing schemes has varied widely across countries and has represented a high per dollar subsidy in some cases. Despite the recent application of some innovative techniques, the social benefit of such schemes has proved difficult to estimate, not least because their goals have been vague. Operational design has influenced the cost and apparent effectiveness of different schemes and has also varied widely. Clear and precise goals, against which performance is regularly monitored, realistic pricing verified by consistent and transparent accounting, and attention to the incentive features of operational design, especially for the intermediaries, are among the prerequisites for such schemes to have a good chance of truly achieving improvements in social welfare.

This paper reviews the design of <b>partial</b> credit <b>guarantee</b> schemes in MENA, and assesses their preliminary outcomes. The paper is based on a survey conducted in 10 MENA {{countries in}} early 2010. The authors find that the average size of guarantee schemes in MENA (measured by the total value of outstanding guarantees) is in line with the international average, although there are wide differences across countries, and some schemes seem too small to make any significant impact. Most importantly, the number of guarantees looks generally small while their average value looks large. This suggests that guarantee schemes are not yet reaching the smaller firms. Guarantee schemes in MENA look financially sound and most schemes have room to grow. However, this growth should be accompanied by an improvement of some key design and management features, as well as the introduction of systematic impact evaluation reviews.
