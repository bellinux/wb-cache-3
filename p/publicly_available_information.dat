5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using <b>publicly</b> <b>available</b> <b>information,</b> to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of communications between Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Inmarsat's satellite telecommunication network provide {{the only source}} of information about Flight 370's location and possible in-flight events after it disappeared from radar coverage at 2:22Malaysia Standard Time (MYT) on 8March 2014 (17:22UTC, 7March), one hour after communication with air traffic control ended and the aircraft departed from its planned flight path while over the South China Sea. Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of <b>publicly</b> <b>available</b> <b>information</b> for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

2500|$|There was no {{involvement}} or {{prior knowledge}} of Green by the IRA in Ireland. [...] It is likely, however, {{that the possibility of}} such planning was on the mind of Sean Russell and his acting Chief of Staff Stephen Hayes. [...] Russell is known to have reached out to the German Foreign Ministry and Abwehr during his time in Berlin, and Hayes is known to have sanctioned Plan Kathleen before it was delivered to the Abwehr in Berlin in August 1940. [...] However, no operational instructions were issued to Abwehr agents to gather data on Ireland in preparation for Green. This is possibly because the planners felt they had enough militarily useful data already, but likely because Green, although thorough, was created in a hurry. [...] Later editions contained no data from the IRA, instead only adding from <b>publicly</b> <b>available</b> <b>information</b> in reference books and details provided by German civilians who had worked in Ireland during the 1930s.|$|E
