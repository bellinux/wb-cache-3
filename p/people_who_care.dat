5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) {{recommend that the}} protective gear leaves no skin exposed. These measures are also recommended for those who may handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids. In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly. In Sierra Leone, the typical training period {{for the use of}} such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.|$|E

500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{paranoia}} behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with mind control, population control, occultism, surveillance abuse, Big Business, Big Government, and globalization arises {{from a combination of}} two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong individualist values and 2) lacks power. The first attribute refers to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call [...] "agency panic," [...] intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Safari"'s setpiece {{shows some}} of Springfield's {{citizens}} mistreating the bag boys {{in a grocery}} store, prompting the bag boys to go on strike. The sequence was inspired by an Albertsons store in Los Angeles, whose employees went on strike {{at the time the}} episode was written. The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle. Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode's script. Because of his involvement with the episode, [...] "Simpson Safari" [...] contains several [...] "classic" [...] Swarzwelder-type jokes, according to staff writer Matt Selman. Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor's hut. After Swarzwelder wrote the first draft, the writing staff rewrote the script. When writing the episode, the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic. Commenting on the episode, Selman said [...] "It's kind of a combination of really nice, observational designs and then just [...] things that are deliberately wrong. To anger <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about things being real." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E
50|$|Some {{criticism}} also {{emerged from}} the campaign's wrist-bands, and how they had apparently become fashionable amongst <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> little about the original message (see the MakePovertyFashionable parody). Further criticism derives {{from the fact that}} some of these wristbands were proven to have been produced by forced labourers in Chinese sweatshops.|$|R

2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about this stuff. How {{do you say to the}} average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been so disappointed and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all viewers {{considered}} Willow and Tara's relationship {{a positive}} development. Some fans loyal to Willow reacted angrily as {{she chose to}} be with Tara when Oz made himself available, and they lashed out at Tara and Amber Benson on the fansite message boards. Whedon replied sardonically, [...] "we're going to shift away from this whole lifestyle choice that Willow has made. Just wipe the slate. From now on, Willow {{will no longer be}} a Jew. And I think we can all breathe easier." [...] However, he seriously explained his motivation, writing [...] "My show is about emotion. Love is the most powerful, messy, delightful and dangerous emotion... Willow's in love. I think it's cool." [...] Hannigan was also positive about the way the character and her relationship with Tara was written: [...] "It is not about being controversial or making a statement. I think the show is handling it really nicely. It's about two <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about each other." ...|$|E
