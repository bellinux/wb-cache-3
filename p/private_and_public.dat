The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He has done some things that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} interplay between <b>private</b> {{regulators}} <b>and</b> <b>public</b> supervisors within principles-based regulation and meta-regulation in the post-crisis European retail financial services landscape. It shows that {{the way in which}} the compliance with such regulatory frameworks is supervised and enforced may determine the type of relationship between <b>private</b> regulators <b>and</b> <b>public</b> supervisors cooperative or competitive that prevails at a specific moment in time. While there is evidence of both cooperation and competition between the two in the post-crisis era, a predominantly competitive relationship between <b>private</b> regulators <b>and</b> <b>public</b> watchdogs may severely undermine the practical importance of co-governance arrangements. A significant degree of cooperation between <b>private</b> regulators <b>and</b> <b>public</b> supervisors is key to ensuring their effectiveness. <b>Public</b> supervision <b>and</b> enforcement must therefore be responsive to the peculiarities of co-governance arrangements.

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate <b>private</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
