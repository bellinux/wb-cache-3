5|$|Sheik Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain {{during the}} 1930s, {{was known for}} a pack of Salukis that {{accompanied}} him throughout the Arab world on hunting trips. Following his death, his son Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa attempted to keep the lines <b>pure-bred</b> but they became interbred with other breeds. However, the <b>pure-bred</b> lines of the royal kennel were saved by the efforts of Dana Al Khalifa who was given two <b>pure-bred</b> puppies by the King, and about a decade later had <b>pure-bred</b> Salukis registered with the Kennel Club of Bahrain. Today, the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East and were hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region. They are considered clean by the Bedouins, and are allowed to be in women's quarters, while other dogs must be kept outside.|$|E
5|$|The sheep {{populations that}} were {{required}} by Bennetts at Avondale also afforded additional research opportunities. From 1931 {{for several years}} experiments were conducted with the object of determining how to best produce prime export lambs. This investigated various breeds and cross breeds determining that cross-bred ewes where significantly more productive than <b>pure-bred</b> Merinos.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the <b>pure-bred</b> Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

50|$|Cayden {{becomes a}} drifter, {{trying to keep}} his lycanthropy under control. In a {{roadside}} bar, Cayden draws the attention of Wild Joe (John Pyper-Ferguson), who reveals himself to be a werewolf. Wild Joe explains that werewolves come in two types, <b>pure-breds</b> and the bitten. The bitten are more savage and do not give birth to werewolf children. <b>Pure-breds</b> are natural-born werewolves from a small number of werewolf families that came to North America with the early settlers. Cayden has only recently discovered that he was adopted, and Wild Joe confirms that they are both natural werewolves and that Cayden can find out more in a remote town called Lupine Ridge.|$|R
50|$|He {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1904 and a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1908. He and his wife built a house on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. They also kept a summer home (Gads Hill) at Cacouna and an estate (Huntlywood), which {{is now known as}} Beaconsfield, where they raised <b>pure-breds</b> and kept a private golf course for their friends. He died in 1910 and is buried in Mount Royal Cemetery.|$|R
5|$|Princess Elizabeth {{was then}} given a Pembroke Corgi of her own, named Susan, for her 18th {{birthday}} in 1944. She {{had a strong}} connection to the dog, which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs which were either <b>pure-bred</b> Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis.|$|E
5|$|Judy was a <b>pure-bred</b> {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a {{boarding}} kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a <b>pure-bred</b> rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|Friskies is {{produced}} and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by Carnation through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry food products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with <b>pure-breds</b> in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|R
50|$|Paws With A Cause {{dogs are}} donated as puppies by private breeders, bred at PAWS {{headquarters}} in Wayland, Michigan, or rescued from animal shelters. While {{most of the}} dogs are Golden Retrievers or Labrador Retrievers, other <b>pure-breds</b> such as Cairn Terriers, Papillions, and Poodles are used as well. In all cases, however, donated puppies' parents' hips must be OFA-certified as good or excellent, and all dogs are X-ray-screened before entering formal training. At an average of eight weeks, puppies are placed with volunteer Foster Puppy Raisers {{who are responsible for}} basic obedience training and socialization. When the Foster Puppies reach 14-18 months of age, they are transported to PAWS National Headquarters for formal training.|$|R
50|$|The Tersk {{was formed}} {{mainly from the}} Strelets Arabians, bred at the Strelets stud in Ukraine and {{virtually}} extinct by the 1920s. The Strelets was produced by crossing pure Arabians with high-quality Orlov Trotters and Anglo-Arabians. A little Thoroughbred blood was also added. The resulting horse had an Arabian look, but was larger than the <b>pure-breds.</b> The remaining Strelets, including the two stallions Tsenitel and Tsilindr, {{were taken to the}} Tersk Stud in an attempt to increase their numbers. At the stud, the stallions were mated with Arabian, Don, Strelets, Kabarda, and various cross-bred mares, including Strelets x Kabardin and Arabian x Don. Early crosses produced a successful Arabian-type horse. It was further improved by three Arabian stallions: Marosh, Nasim, and Koheilan. The Tersk has also been continually improved by Kabardin, Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Russian Don blood. By 1948, the breed was officially recognized.|$|R
25|$|Kangaroo Island {{is noted}} for its honey and its Ligurian honey bees. The island has the world's only <b>pure-bred</b> and {{disease-free}} population {{of this type of}} bee. The exporting of <b>pure-bred</b> queen bees is a notable industry for the island. For this reason there are significant quarantine restrictions on bringing bee products and bee-handling equipment onto the island.|$|E

25|$|Drawing on {{the ideas}} of Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), European fascists decried the {{supposed}} degenerating effect of immigration on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like Germany, which had a supposedly <b>pure-bred</b> racial stock.|$|E
40|$|Copy number {{variation}} (CNV) contributes {{significantly to}} natural genetic variation {{within and between}} populations. However, the mutational mechanisms leading to copy number variation, {{as well as the}} processes that control the size of CNV regions are so far not well understood. This thesis deals with CNVs containing X- and Y- linked members of a large gene family in Mus musculus ssps. The phenomenon that CNV regions show dramatic copy number amplifications in intersubspecific hybrids of M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus is described. This is observed in natural and laboratory-bred hybrids. Extreme Copy number amplification, not found in wild-caught hybrids, can be generated under laboratory conditions, suggesting that there is a selection against this CNV destabilization phenomenon in the wild. Specific analysis of hybrid males indicates that neither meiotic recombination nor inter-chromosomal exchange is required for this to occur, suggesting intrachromosomal (i. e. sister chromatid) exchange that can occur at an elevated frequency in intersubspecific crosses. As confirmation, I can detect a greater number of somatic CNVs between organs in hybrid individuals than in <b>pure-breds</b> and disruptions in DNA repair pathways known to regulate sister chromatid exchange also appear to be misregulated in some hybrids. It appears that the relative stability of CNV loci in pure-breeding populations can be disrupted in crosses with animals from another population, and this relies on mutational mechanisms acting during development. This finding offers a unique perspective on reproductive isolation and may be important for understanding the build-up of genetic incompatibilities between these subspecies...|$|R

He boarded them here twice. You couldn't go among them without a club in your hand. I had a Mexican lad laid up by them. He was a tough one, too. But they got him down and nearly ate him. The doctors took over forty {{stitches}} in him and shot him full of that Pasteur dope for hydrophobia. And he always will limp with his right leg from what the dogs did to him. I tell you, they were the limit. And yet, every time the curtain went up, Captain Roberts brought the house down with the first stunt. Those dogs just flocked all over him, loving him to death, from the looks of it. And were they loving him? They hated him. I've seen him, right here in the cage at Cedarwild, wade into them with a club and whale the stuffing impartially out of all of them. Sure, they loved him not. Just a bit of the same old aniseed was what he used. He'd soak small pieces of meat in aniseed oil and stick them in his pockets. But that stunt would only work with a bunch of giant dogs like his. It was their size that got it across. Had they been a lot of ordinary dogs it would have looked silly. And, besides, they didn't do their regular tricks for aniseed. They did it for Captain Roberts's club. He was a tough bird himself." ...|$|R

Parrish was married three times and was the first breeder of <b>pure-bred</b> sheep in Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Aviaries and vivaria are {{arranged}} around {{the sides of}} the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for birds of paradise and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one <b>pure-bred</b> and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, Palawan peacock-pheasants, Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, Mindanao bleeding-hearts Green Aracari and Luzon Scops Owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbird.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, the American Field put {{together}} the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United States was born. The FDSB is the oldest <b>pure-bred</b> registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of English Setter and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red Irish Setter became a favourite in the dog show ring.|$|E
25|$|Since the Chamberlain case, proven {{cases of}} attacks on humans by dingoes have been {{discussed}} in the public domain, in particular dingo attacks on Fraser Island (off the Queensland coast), the last refuge in Australia for isolated <b>pure-bred</b> wild dingoes. In the wake of these attacks, it emerged {{that there had been}} at least 400 documented dingo attacks on Fraser Island. Most were against children, but at least two were on adults. For example, in April 1998, a 13-month-old girl was attacked by a dingo and dragged for about one metre (3ft) from a picnic blanket at the Waddy Point camping area. The child was dropped when her father intervened.|$|E
25|$|The CSIR had {{concluded}} in 1943 that any extension Brahman cross-breeding would require further importations to avoid inbreeding in the cross-bred population. Post-war, Atkinson and others followed this advice with further purchases of <b>pure-bred</b> Brahman from overseas {{to develop the}} breed. Between 1949 and 1951 Atkinson imported two Brahman bulls and two heifers from the USA. In 1950 Waverley Station, also imported Brahman cattle. By 1954, 49 head had been imported to Australia; however, importations were terminated in 1954 because of {{the outbreak of the}} disease bluetongue in the USA. It was not until 1981 when health protocols changed that importation from the USA recommenced and between then and 2002 more than 700 animals were imported.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tropically-adapted Brahman stock revolutionized the beef cattle industry in northern Australia. It transformed struggling enterprises into efficient and profitable ones and contributed {{billions of dollars}} to domestic and export income. In 2000 a Meat and Livestock Australia project assessed the contribution to the Australian economy by Brahman genetics. Analysis of the economic return on investment for the Australian beef industry from 1970 to 2000 found that Brahman and Bos indicus infusion delivered an additional individual on-farm benefit of $9170 per annum. About 40,000 Australian cattle producers gained from this additional profit in each of those 30 years. Brahman and Brahman-infused cattle accounted for 90 per cent of the genetic improvement in the Australian industry. The cumulative on-farm return since 1970 from investment in Bos indicus genetics amounted to $10.2 billion of a total on-farm return to the national beef industry from all forms of technology of $11 billion. In 2013 ABBA comprises over 1200 members and is the largest beef cattle breed association, by membership, in Australia. Currently, a little over 50% of the Australian beef cattle herd has Brahman blood, while about 11 per cent of the herd is <b>pure-bred.</b> There are about 110,000 Brahman bulls above the Tropic of Capricorn, that is, about 70% of bulls in that region.|$|E
500|$|Top cross (or [...] "topcross") hybrids {{result from}} the {{crossing}} of a top quality or <b>pure-bred</b> male and a lower quality female, intended {{to improve the quality}} of the offspring, on average.|$|E
500|$|Labrador Retrievers are {{registered}} in three colours: black (a solid black colour), yellow (considered from cream to fox-red), and chocolate (medium to dark brown). Some dogs are sold as silver <b>pure-bred</b> Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently disputed by breed experts including breed clubs and breed councils. [...] Some major kennel clubs {{around the world}} allow silver Labradors to be registered, but not as silver. The Kennel Club (England) requires that they be registered as [...] "Non-recognised." ...|$|E
500|$|Both major {{types of}} Fox Terrier are mostly white with {{coloured}} markings and have similar facial characteristics. They are {{essentially the same}} except for differences in coats, and slight differences in colouration and markings. Markings on either type can appear black at birth on the head, but may lighten in adult life, the most common colours being tan and black. The markings are a type of piebald spotting. [...] Although the two main breeds were originally commonly interbred, this no longer occurs in <b>pure-bred</b> lines.|$|E
500|$|Some interbreeding {{with other}} breeds {{took place in}} the mid-1800s, which may have {{introduced}} Dachshund blood into the breed, although certain breeders maintained <b>pure-bred</b> lines. The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of [...] "Stonehenge" [...] in the 1880s, and was denied by many breeders of that era. By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott's writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement {{in the development of the}} Bedlington Terrier.|$|E
500|$|As of 2001, horses bred with American bloodlines {{were not}} allowed to be {{registered}} with the British Association, and the breed was considered the rarest horse breed in the United Kingdom. Although the Suffolk Punch population has continued to increase, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK considers their survival status critical, in 2011 there were between 800 and 1,200horses in the United States and around 150 in England. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy also lists the breed as critical. The Suffolk Horse Society recorded the births of 36 <b>pure-bred</b> foals in 2007, and a further 33 foals as of March 2008. [...] By 2016, there were approximately 300 Suffolk Punches in the UK with 30 to 40 pure bred foals being born annually.|$|E
500|$|The breed's {{survival}} {{during the}} 20th century is owed {{to a few}} families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive. John Law Ayers was one such breeder; in 1984, he donated his herd of <b>pure-bred</b> Cracker horses {{to the state of}} Florida. With them, the state started three small herds in Tallahassee, Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve. By 1989, however, these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established. After the registry was created, 75 horses designated as [...] "foundation horses" [...] and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered. These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts – partbred horses were denied entry to the registry. As of 2009, around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry.|$|E
500|$|The Poitou donkey is [...] "instantly recognizable" [...] for {{a number}} of unusual {{characteristics}} that distinguish it from other donkeys. Its shaggy coat, called a cadanette, hangs in long cords when ungroomed because of the long, soft hair. Animals with great cadanettes of matted and tangled hair were most highly valued. A purebred Poitou has a more massive bone structure and a larger foot than a part-bred animal, but the shaggy coat is such a dominant trait that even a 1/8 Poitou donkey may resemble a <b>pure-bred.</b> In modern times, the coat is still considered important but less so than size and measurements. [...] Today, many Poitou donkeys are shorn for the purpose of hygiene, but some are allowed to grow their coats out so as to have [...] "bourailloux", or coats of great length. The coat is always dark brown or black. While lacking the stripes and cross-like markings on the coats of some other breeds of donkey, the Poitou should have a white underbelly, nose and rings around its eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson {{increased}} {{the diversity of}} his herd through purchases within Queensland and overseas. During 1946 he purchased all the <b>pure-bred</b> Brahman from the Australian Estates Co Ltd property Millungera station, including the bull [...] "Texas". He later purchased another CSIR syndicate bull, [...] "Jake 315", from Glenprairie station. These, together with the cattle he had acquired earlier, made his total of 43 pure-breds the biggest of any <b>pure-bred</b> herd. His objective was to maintain a study of Brahman cattle and eventually have a 3/8s Brahman herd on his property. In 1947 Wairuna had a total of 850 head of pure and cross-bred Brahman cattle.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943 the Wairuna Brahman cross-bred (hybrid) herd totalled 170 {{including}} the <b>pure-bred</b> bull [...] "Abel" [...] and one <b>pure-bred</b> female; the remainder being various cross-bred cattle. The hybrids, which were relatively few in number, were depastured {{with the other}} cattle (mainly Devon Shorthorn crosses), of which there were approximately 7000. Atkinson had inspected the cross-bred herds {{of three of the}} older members of the breeding syndicate and considered that 3/8 Brahman was the proportion most likely to serve his purpose. He had devised a breeding plan to achieve this objective and facilities for this programme were available on Wairuna. By 1943, Brahman-cross bullocks had already been marketed from Wairuna.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{independent}} assortment, consider the crossing of the <b>pure-bred</b> homozygote parental strain with genotype AABB with a different <b>pure-bred</b> strain with genotype aabb. [...] A and a and B and b represent the alleles of genes A and B. [...] Crossing these homozygous parental strains will result in F1 generation offspring that are double heterozygotes with genotype AaBb. [...] The F1 offspring AaBb produces gametes that are AB, Ab, aB, and ab with equal frequencies (25%) because the alleles of gene A assort independently of the alleles for gene B during meiosis. [...] Note that 2 of the 4 gametes (50%)—Ab and aB—were not present in the parental generation. [...] These gametes represent recombinant gametes. [...] Recombinant gametes are those gametes that differ from both of the haploid gametes {{that made up the}} original diploid cell. [...] In this example, the recombination frequency is 50% since 2 of the 4 gametes were recombinant gametes.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Ridgebacks, other {{examples}} of culling for cosmetic reasons that were mentioned included Great Danes with nonstandard markings, white German Shepherds, and white Boxers, although it was mentioned that culling by slaughter is not as common as before, as more breeders choose to neuter individuals who do not meet breed standards. (There is high and lucrative demand for <b>pure-bred</b> dogs as neutered pets {{at a lower cost}} that breedable show specimens.) ...|$|E
