25|$|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar {{collector}} (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste {{heat from the}} <b>PV</b> <b>module.</b> The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher exergy and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the <b>PV</b> <b>module</b> is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

40|$|<b>PV</b> <b>modules</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable component of a photovoltaic system. The alleged reliability has led to the long warranty period for modules up to 25  years. Currently, failures resulting in module degradation are generally not considered because of the difficulty of measuring the power of a single <b>module</b> in a <b>PV</b> system and the lack of feedback on the various degradation modes of <b>PV</b> <b>modules.</b> It should be noted that consumers {{are becoming more and more}} interested in the reliability and lifetime of their PV system considering economic issues. Reliability and lifetime of a PV system depend mainly on the energy performance of modules and their different degradation modes. Accordingly, research must more and more focus on photovoltaic modules degradation. This paper presents a review of different types of degradation found in literature in recent years. Thus, according to literature, corrosion and discoloration of <b>PV</b> <b>modules</b> encapsulant are predominant degradation modes. Temperature and humidity are factors of <b>PV</b> <b>modules</b> degradation in almost all identified degradation modes.
