5|$|Of the {{fin whale}} stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids {{dominated}} the diet for {{four of the}} five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera (9%), and the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> (C. saira) and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes jordani). In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury,</b> Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

50|$|These pelagic {{schooling}} {{fish are}} found in the North Pacific, from Korea and Japan eastward to the Gulf of Alaska and southward to subtropical Mexico; 67°N - 18°N, 137°E - 108°W, preferring temperatures around 15 - 18 °C. <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> are usually found near the surface (though they may have a depth range of 0 - 230 m), and they are known to glide above {{the surface of the water}} when moving away from predators (a behavior that links them to the flying fish, a cousin of the saury family).|$|E
50|$|The saury (Cololabis adocetus) (not to be {{confused}} with the <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury,</b> another species in the *Cololabis* genus) is a member of the family Scomberesocidae, or the saury family. It is widespread in the Eastern Pacific in the surface waters, typically remaining in the top 50 centimeters of the water column - although it can be found at depths of up to 1 meter. It can grow to a length of about 5 centimeters. The saury generally lives in waters between 5 and 12 degrees Celsius. The saury is a highly migratory fish.|$|E

50|$|In the North Pacific, small {{schooling}} {{fish and}} krill are major food items. They feed exclusively on Pacific herring {{in the northern}} Okhotsk Sea and only on Alaska pollock east of Sakhalin Island. Japanese mackerel (found in 61 per cent of sampled stomachs) and <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> (18%) are consumed east of the southern Kuril Islands, with only the former species being found in whales sampled in September and the latter species likewise only being found in whales taken in October. Euphausiids make up {{nearly two-thirds of the}} diet (62%) around the western Aleutian Islands, with unidentified fish (19%) constituting most of the rest. On the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido they mainly feed on euphausiids (55%), but also take sardine (24%) and sand lance (13%); on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, they feed almost exclusively on sardine (99%). In Sanriku, sardine makes up the bulk of the diet (54%), but euphausiids also play an important part (32%) - only a small percentage (9%) fed on sand lance. Euphausiids were a major food item on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and off Sanriku in the spring (71, 72 and 62% from April-June in the former area, and 83% in April in the latter area), while sardine dominated the diet in the summer in both areas (71% in September for the former region, and 70, 92, and 93% from May-July in the latter region). More recent data from Japanese scientific catches in the western North Pacific shows Japanese anchovy to be a major component of the diet in two of the three sub-areas (60 per cent by weight in sub-area 7 and 37.4% in sub-area 8), while <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> was the major food item in sub-area 9 (64.6%) and played {{an important part of the}} diet in sub-area 8 (36.4%). Euphausiids (9.2% in all areas combined), Alaska pollock (7.8% in sub-area 7), minimal armhook squid (4.9% in sub-area 9), and mackerel were also consumed. They are thought to feed on juvenile herring and probably sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) around the San Juan Islands, while in the Monterey Bay region they have been observed feeding on baitfish - probably northern anchovy, which is abundant there.|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, {{it feeds}} {{primarily}} on calanoid copepods, specifically Calanus finmarchicus, with a secondary preference for euphausiids, in particular Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa inermis. In the North Pacific, it feeds on similar zooplankton, including the copepod species Neocalanus cristatus, N. plumchrus, and Calanus pacificus, and euphausiid species Euphausia pacifica, E. similis, Thysanoessa inermis, T. longipes, T. gregaria and T. spinifera. In addition, it eats larger organisms, {{such as the}} Japanese flying squid, Todarodes pacificus pacificus, and small fish, including anchovies (Engraulis japonicus and E. mordax), sardines (Sardinops sagax), <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> (Cololabis saira), mackerel (Scomber japonicus and S. australasicus), jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes jordani). Some of these fish are commercially important. Off central California, they mainly feed on anchovies between June and August, and on krill (Euphausia pacifica) during September and October. In the Southern Hemisphere, prey species include the copepods Neocalanus tonsus, Calanus simillimus, and Drepanopus pectinatus, {{as well as the}} euphausiids Euphausia superba and Euphausia vallentini and the pelagic amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{time series}} of ocean climate indices and catch records for seven pelagic fish speciesin the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) regions from 1910 to 2004, wedetected {{regional}} synchrony {{in the long-term}} fluctuations of the fish populations and identified alternation patternsof dominant species related to climate shifts. The annual catches of Pacific herring, Japanese sardines,Japanese anchovies, jack mackerel, chub mackerel, <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> and common squid in the TWC regionfluctuated in phase {{with those in the}} KOC region, which suggests that they were controlled by the samebasin-wide climate forcing. After the collapse of the herring fishery, the alternation sequence was: sardines(1930 s), <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury,</b> jack mackerel, common squid and anchovies (1950 s∼ 1960 s), herring (late 1960 s∼early 1970 s), chub mackerel (1970 s) and then sardines (1980 s). As sardine biomass decreased in the late stages ofthe cool regime, catch of the other four species increased immediately during the warm period of the 1990 s.

40|$|An ecosystem-based {{bioenergetics}} {{model was}} used to investigate the responses of <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury</b> (Cololabis saira) to global warming. The model was forced by the projected sea surface temperature (SST) generated by climate models that formed the bases for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR 4). Twelve climate models, which reproduced the Pacific Decadal Oscillation well compared with observations, were selected and B 1, A 1 B, and A 2 emissions scenarios were used. In total, 33 ensemble simulations were conducted, of which 24 (73 %) showed a decrease in wet weight of <b>Pacific</b> <b>saury.</b> The migration pattern was modified in 11 (33 %) cases. In these cases, higher SST and size reduction under global warming prevented or delayed the southern migration of saury in winter.
