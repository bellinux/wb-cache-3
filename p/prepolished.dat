50|$|The basic {{shape of}} the {{pavilion}} has now been created. More facets at different angles can be placed. Once the basic shape is established, a series of different laps can be used that are of increasingly fine grit. Once the facets are <b>prepolished,</b> a final polish can be performed with a gritless lap treated with polishing compound.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{content of}} interstitially solved oxygen (Oi) in heavily boron doped silicon (9 - 29 mΩcm) were {{measured}} by low temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Therefor an alternative thinning technique for silicon is used: by alkaline potassium hydroxide etching (KOH) <b>prepolished</b> silicon specimens are thinned down to 8 - 60 microns. The optimal end thickness {{depends on the}} boron concentration which specifies the free carrier concentration. Specimens with three different boron concentrations (9 / 19 / 29 mΩcm) were examined. The results are compared with gas fusion analysis (GFA) measurements. Furthermore the precipitated oxygen ∆Oi was measured for a RTA proces...|$|E
40|$|Americans {{are great}} hobbyists. For the unimaginative there are {{supermarket}} style hobby shops {{where they can}} get pretanned leather, premolded plaster, preselected and <b>prepolished</b> stones for jewelry-making, ad infinitum. Then there are shops for collectors of different kinds, such as philatelists and numismatists. But there are some hobbies for which there are no corner shops, and upon which no financial empires are likely to be built. I know a man who collects railroad locomotives, another who presses the leaves of Chinese trees (which {{are hard to come by}} these days), and yet another who collects spider webs and mounts them on black velvet. I, too, am a collector, species logophilia - I collect words...|$|E
50|$|The Vickers microindentation test {{is carried}} out {{in a similar manner}} welling to the Vickers macroindentation tests, using the same pyramid. The Knoop test uses an {{elongated}} pyramid to indent material samples. This elongated pyramid creates a shallow impression, which is beneficial for measuring the hardness of brittle materials or thin components. Both the Knoop and Vickers indenters require <b>prepolishing</b> of the surface to achieve accurate results.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semirigid (SR) bonnet tool {{which has the}} advantages of high efficiency and determinacy for material removal on optical elements and also {{has the potential to}} be used on aspheric optics. It consists of three layers: a metal sheet, a rubber membrane, and a polishing pad, from inside to outside. It inherits the flexibility of a normal bonnet but has a higher stiffness. Finite element analysis was performed to determine that the stainless steel is the best-suited material for use as the metal sheet. An SR bonnet with a stainless-steel metal sheet was fabricated and tested. Its tool influence function (TIF) is Gaussian-like, and the TIF stability is more than 90 %. The peak-to-valley of its uniform removal area is less than 0. 1 λ. Tool ripples are highly depressed and the surface profile is well preserved in the <b>prepolishing</b> test. In 12 min, ～ 36 mm 3 of material is removed...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} ten years a variety of CNC {{manufacturers}} for aspherical surfaces have been established. The field of applications they are working for are very different. The way CNC manufacturers measure surfaces as well as the way they characterize the surface form deviation differs even more. Furthermore, {{there are a lot of}} customers being interested in using aspherical surfaces in their applications. In fact, aspherical lenses are not established as standard optical elements yet which is due to the fact that many users are not familiar with the implications of the use of aspherical surfaces with respect to the tolerancing of the optical system. Only few know how to specify an asphere, moreover, they differ about how to do that. The paper will give an insight in what is possible in aspherical manufacturing in terms of accuracy, efficiency, number of pieces per design and surface forms. An important issue is the development of deviation of form and slope in connection to <b>prepolishing</b> and correction polishing. Based on experiences of the manufacture of more than 500 different aspherical designs with diameters ranging from 3 - 200 mm, the paper is going to give an insight into production practices. Finally, there will be a general overview on what could be done and what needs to be done in order to unify the different ways of tolerancing of aspherical surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in enhancing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on titanium surfaces. Materials and methods: The adherence of 21 bacterial isolates to <b>prepolished</b> 1 cm 2 titanium samples was screened using fluorescence microscopy. Three isolates that exhibited “low” (Porphyromonas gingivalis R 17870), “moderate” (Porphyromonas gingivalis 5335), and “extensive” (Prevotella denticola R 9102) adherence to titanium were then examined for titanium adherence {{in the presence of}} the ECM proteins vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, collagen type I, and collagen type IV. Results: Several ECM proteins had a considerable effect on increasing adherence of the bacteria to titanium compared to a control (no protein treatment). The most significant difference was seen with vitronectin for P. gingivalis 5335 (p 0. 05), whilst collagen type I and fibronectin did result in significantly enhanced adherence (p < 0. 05, 24 h). Conclusions: ECM matrix proteins promote adherence of potential periodontal pathogenic bacteria to titanium surfaces. Management of diseases such as peri-implantitis should focus on limitation of this bacterial adherence to reduce/eliminate biofilms...|$|E
40|$|Stability {{and removal}} of {{dexamethasone}} sodium phosphate (DSP) from wastewater produced at Al-Quds University Campus were investigated. Kinetic studies in both pure {{water and wastewater}} coming from secondary treatment (activated sludge) demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory DSP underwent degradation to its hydrolytic derivative, dexamethasone, in both media. The first-order hydrolysis rate of DSP in activated sludge at 25 ◦C (3. 80 × 10 − 6 s− 1) was about 12 -fold larger than in pure water (3. 25 × 10 − 7 s− 1). The overall performance of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed in the University Campus was also assessed showing that 90 % of spiked DSP was removed together with its newly identified metabolites by the ultra-filtration (UF) system, which consists of a UF hollow fibre (HF) with a 100 -kDa cutoff membrane as the <b>prepolishing</b> stage for the UF spiral wound with a 20 -kDa cutoff membrane. In testing other technologies, the effectiveness of adsorption and filtration by micelle–clay (MC) preparation for removing DSP was ascertained in comparison with activated charcoal. Batch adsorption in aqueous suspensions of the MC composite and activated carbon was well described by Langmuir isotherms showing the best results for MC material. Filtration of DSP water solutions demonstrated a significant advantage of columns filled in {{with a mixture of}} sand and MC complex in comparison with activated carbon/sand filter...|$|R
