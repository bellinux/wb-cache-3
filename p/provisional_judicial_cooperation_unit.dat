The first chapter deals with general information about <b>judicial</b> and police <b>cooperation</b> in criminal matters in the EU. It summarizes its history and discusses differences {{between the first and}} third pillar of the European Union and mentions the changes after adoption of the Lisbon Treaty which abolished the pillar structure.

It shows that, for a long time, Europol and Eurojust have developed in different ways, both with regard to autonomy and accountability, and that the relationship between these phenomena has been anything but straightforward. Moreover, it demonstrates that design has been a necessary but not a sufficient condition for both agencies' evolution, thus putting recent formal-legal changes to the agencies' design (most notably Europol becoming a full-fledged agency) into perspective...|$|R

40|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and {{approximation}} play {{a central}} role in this contribu-tion. Approximation is interpreted in a very broad manner, encompassing both EU and non-EU instruments. Because <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in itself is too vague and too abstract to be analysed, the scope was narrowed to two specific case studies. Both mutual recognition and Eurojust are considered to have a symbolic value in the field of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and have a clear link with approximation: the double criminality requirement and the delineation of competence scope. Analysis reveals that approximation is not used to its full potential when it comes to facilitating <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> even though this is the main function of approximation. Besides arguments relating to a common sense and logic reasoning, there are valid legal and policy arguments to improve the use of approximation to facilitate <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R

Increase of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings, and the advent of terrorism, made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between States. Particular attention is paid on judicial collaboration between Western Balkans and the EU. CARDS program is a suitable evidence of it. <b>Judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> includes mutual recognition of <b>judicial</b> decisions, <b>cooperation</b> in investigations, approximation of penal legislation of involved states, including the penalties. During the investigations, prior to an international request for warrant of arrest, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between magistrates belonging to different countries.; this create new need for <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> environment supporting a cross-border <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> between EU and Countries of enlarging Europe. 1.

40|$|Globalization {{presents}} an important opportunity for police and justice officials {{around the world}} to cooperate with one another to bring offenders of serious transnational organized crime to justice. Numerous trends and developments are emerging in Europe—especially in the cross-border Meuse–Rhine Euregion, where the three countries of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany meet. Indeed, the police and justice officials of the Meuse–Rhine Euregion are acknowledged as the “pioneers” of routine cross-border police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and due to various factors, their work is arguably among the most long-standing, advanced, and intense in the world. Despite an expanding legal framework, however, operational problems still arise in practice. Therefore, one question becomes: how may international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The Meuse–Rhine Euregion frames this multi-site case study, which uses the Organizational Behavior (OB) approach to examine the state-of-the-art. Specifically, the analysis of scholarly literature, international law, and in-depth personal interviews with 44 English-speaking police detectives, senior police commanders, prosecutors, and examining magistrates from 21 organizations across the three countries in this Euregion provides the data to answer this study’s four main research questions, namely: (1) What is the status quo with respect to international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; (2) How does the process of international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion operate in practice, according to police and justice officials?; (3) What variables affect (facilitate/impede) international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; and (4) How can international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The findings of this study may help improve international police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, and inspire similar cooperative efforts around the world...|$|R

40|$|Because mutual {{recognition}} is now {{enshrined in the}} Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of {{mutual recognition}} is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} mutual recognition appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what mutual recognition is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews mutual recognition as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that mutual recognition is the cornerstone of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what mutual recognition entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> instruments (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between police, customs and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and move ahead with the introduction of mutual recognition as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of mutual recognition {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 15 June 2012 Examining Board: Professor Neil Walker, EUI / University of Edinburgh (Supervisor); Professor Marise Cremona, EUI; Professor Valsamis Mitsilegas, Queen Mary, University of London; Professor Kimmo Nuotio, University of Helsinki. This thesis shall {{contribute}} to European Criminal Procedure, a rapidly evolving area of EU policy that has attracted much attention, but {{has also been}} subject to criticism. The research will first identify and analyse the main rationales of this area. Since the Tampere European Council of 1999, mutual recognition {{has become the most}} fundamental concept of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in criminal matters and has experienced a steep career, having been adopted by Art. 82 TFEU. When the principle of mutual recognition was introduced, it was based on an analogy to the free movement of goods. This analogy has often been regarded as flawed. Moreover, {{there has always been a}} notion of mutual recognition in <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> as well. The study will show how these two factors have influenced the development of the area, and how policy concepts, such as the principle of mutual trust, have had a greater influence on the development of the law than any legal doctrine. The lack of a coherent approach to the area of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and the unsystematic combination of different legal orders have caused unforeseen frictions for the individual. These will be illustrated by an analysis of the law of transnational evidence-gathering according to the European Evidence Warrant and the proposed European Investigation Order. It will be shown that most of the problems result from the lack of a uniform allocation of jurisdiction and from an overly confined understanding of fundamental rights in the context of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> By analysing the nature and purpose of jurisdictional rules in a national and a European context, the thesis aims at uncovering the theoretic foundations on which a uniform allocation of jurisdiction could be built. Finally, the thesis analyses the role of fundamental rights in <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> It will uncover the ineptness of a nation-state oriented interpretation of fundamental rights to adequately address the problems of mutual recognition and argue for a European understanding of transnational judicial rights...|$|R
