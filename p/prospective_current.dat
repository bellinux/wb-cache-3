50|$|The {{series motor}} {{responds}} to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises in {{proportional to the}} square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, but there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. Series wound motors were widely used as traction motors in rail transport of every kind, but are being phased out in favour of power inverter-fed AC induction motors. The counter emf aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate, the counter emf is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance.As the <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> through the armature is very large, the need arises for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter emf. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out.|$|E

This paper also describes the temperature evolution and the Joule energy dissipated in a fuse element during the pre-arcing time. By varying typical electrical parameters, namely the closing angle and the power factor, we show that various prospective currents such as those observed in industrial case can be fairly simulated. The pre-arcing time and then the clearing of the fault current are shown to be deeply dependent on these electrical characteristics. We exhibit simulated results of <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> and supply voltage waves for given closing angles under two typical power factors which are compared with the experimental ones.

However, local control rates after conventional-dose radiotherapy remain disappointing [2] despite concur-rent use of chemotherapy. Dose escalation has the po-tential of improving local control as well as survival if the higher doses can be delivered safely. The physical characteristics of protons allow substantial reductions in the radiation dose to normal tissues while maximi-zing the dose to the tumor [3, 4]. Indeed, we have pub-lished promising preliminary results from a <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy for stage III NSCLC [5]. Although protons can potentially spare more critical structures than photons can, proton therapy is more sensitive to uncertainties because of the tissue-density-dependent finite range of proton beams. The density variations can be induced by all forms of uncertainties, including those associated with set-up, organ motion, and the range uncertainty that is caused by CT number and proton stopping power uncertainties. Plans that do not adequately account for uncertainties (i. e., are insuffi-ciently robust) may be of questionable reliability and lead to unforeseen outcomes such as local failure an...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions are increasingly involved in measuring students' satisfaction and communicating messages to <b>prospective,</b> <b>current,</b> and previous students. A {{review of the}} literature suggests that institutions have traditionally focused on cognitive rather than affective measures, and have communicated messages in a media environment that could be dominated by the institution. This paper seeks to contribute by investigating the role of peer-to-peer social network media in evoking emotions about attending university prior to enrolment and subsequent satisfaction with it. A two-stage study involving 519 prospective students from a UK higher education institution were asked about their cognition and emotions one month prior to enrolment and again one month after. Hypotheses related their involvement in online peer-to-peer media to their perceived level of satisfaction, emotions evoked, and likelihood of recommending the institution. It was found that emotions were a better predictor of likelihood of recommendation than cognitive measures of satisfaction. Positive emotions evoked during the pre-enrolment phase led to positive emotions post-enrolment. There was an association between prospective students' level of involvement with online communities prior to enrolment and their level of evoked positive emotions...|$|E

In spite of these evolutions on the Ic and n-index values, the effect of inhomogeneity on long tape lengths must be investigated, in particular, for application in resistive-type SFCLs where several hundred meters must be used for 15 -kV voltage level units. The degradation or irreversible damage in REBCO tapes assisted by an optimized external shunt resistor was investigated on 12 -mm-width tapes submitted to repetitive overcurrent tests. A modular unit with six stacks of 0. 7 -m-length tapes was built and tested by applying repetitive overcurrent during 80 ms, with recovery time intervals from 1 to 3 s (under load and no-load conditions), for <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> levels from 0. 8 to 3 kA, with the limiting factor of 1. 7 and 3. 2.

40|$|Polymer-based nanocomposites (PNCs) display {{fascinating}} functionalities to {{be useful}} in electrical switching applications like circuit breakers, switch gears, etc. These PNCs are fabricated by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) into a polymer by in-situ polymerization. When the PNCs interrupt the high energetic fault currents generate between the two contacts in a circuit breaker, they outgas (ablation) chemical species and cooling gases, which change the thermodynamic properties of the arcing environment leading to quench the electrical arcs quickly. Two PNCs are fabricated with different wt% of oleic acid modified CuO NPs and a polymer matrix i. e. poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA). These PNCs are tested with the electrical arcs of a <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> of 1. 6 kA generated in the test-setup. The electrical signals (arc current and voltage) and computed dissipated enegy i. e., ∫() () help to understand the effect of PNCs on the electrical arcs. In addition to that, the computed joule integral and mass loss of the PNCs due to outgassing is reported.

Susceptibility to chronic beryllium disease, a granulomatous lung disease that appears in workers exposed to beryllium, is modified by genetic variants of the HLA-DP subregion. Evaluation of HLA-DPB 1 sequence motifs in current and former beryllium workers implicated a glutamic acid residue at position 69 (HLA-DPB 1 Glu 69) in chronic beryllium disease. This finding has since been extended to specific HLA-DPB 1 Glu 69 alleles.

40|$|Current status {{observation}} on survival {{times has}} recently been widely studied. An extreme form of interval censoring, this data structure refers to situations where the only available information on a survival random variable, T, {{is whether or not}} T exceeds a random independent monitoring time C, a binary random variable, Y. To date, nonparametric analyses of current status data have assumed the availability of i. i. d. random samples of the random variable (Y, C), or a similar random sample at each of a set of fixed monitoring times. In many situations, it is useful to consider a case-control sampling scheme. Here, cases refer to a random sample of observations on C from the sub-population where T is {{less than or equal to}} C. On the other hand, controls provide a random sample of observations from the sub-population where T is greater than C. In this paper, we examine the identifiability of the distribution function F of T from such case-control current status data, showing that F is identified up to a one parameter family of distribution functions. With supplementary information on the relative population frequency of cases/controls, a simple weighted version of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> status data provides a natural estimate for case-control samples.

40|$|This policy brief updates Cline and Williamson's {{estimates}} of fundamental equilibrium exchange rates (FEERs) to May 2010 using {{the data to}} March contained in the April issue of the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook. The IMF's data are updated to May by subsequent exchange rate changes and Cline's {{estimates of}} the impact of exchange rate changes on trade flows. In addition, the assumptions about current account targets have been somewhat modified from previous years: All countries are now assumed to aim to keep current account balances within 3 percent of equilibrium, whereas formerly some countries with large net foreign assets to GDP ratios (NFA/GDP) were allowed larger targeted imbalances. The fundamental question explored is what pattern of exchange rates is consistent with satisfactory medium-term evolution of the world economy, interpreted as achieving those objectives while maintaining internal balance in each country. The big disequilibrium in the pattern of exchange rates remains the undervaluation of the renminbi and the overvaluation of the dollar. The size of this disequilibrium is, however, less than previously estimated (now 15 percent on an effective basis and 24 percent bilaterally with respect to the dollar), due to the decline in the IMF's estimate of China's <b>prospective</b> <b>current</b> account surplus. The recent depreciation of the euro, while increasing the size of Euroland's prospective surplus, does not threaten to lead to an internationally unacceptable imbalance (i. e., greater than 3 percent of GDP) and therefore does not create a case for international action to reverse the rise. The yen is no longer found to be overvalued on an effective basis, although if China revalued that would create a case for a stronger yen/dollar rate. Several of the other East Asian currencies would also need to appreciate bilaterally to avoid effective undervaluation. Of the 28 other economies covered, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan are judged to need an effective appreciation and Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, South Africa, and Turkey to need an effective depreciation. ...|$|E
