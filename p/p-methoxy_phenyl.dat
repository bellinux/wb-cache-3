40|$|Nine {{endophytic}} fungal strains labeled as AL- 1, AL- 2, AS- 1, AS- 2, AS- 3, AS- 4, AR- 1, AR- 2 and AR- 4 {{were isolated}} from the medicinal plant Aquilaria malaccensis Lamk. Three compounds 1, 7 -dihydroxy- 3 -methoxyanthraquinone, propyl <b>p-methoxy</b> <b>phenyl</b> ether and 6 -methoxy- 7 -O-(p-methoxyphenyl) -coumarin were {{isolated from the}} ethyl acetate extract of the strain AL- 2 by silica gel column chromatography and HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques i. e. UV, IR, 1 D and 2 D NMR. Extracts of the strain AL- 2 were assessed for antibacterial activities against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and general toxicity against brine shrimp lethality assay. The ethyl acetate extract showed only mild activity against two Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) ...|$|E
40|$|We report, for {{the first}} time, the {{biotransformation}} of potential pollutants bearing the pentafluorosulfanyl (SF 5 -) functional group in a fungus and bacteria. Cunninghamella elegans transformed <b>p-methoxy</b> <b>phenyl</b> SF 5 via demethylation; Pseudomonas knackmussii and P. pseudoalcaligenes KF 707 transformed amino-, hydroxyamino- and diamino- substituted phenyl SF 5, forming the N-acetylated derivatives as the main product. Cell-free extract of Streptomyces griseus transformed 4 -amino- 3 -hydroxy-phenyl SF 5 to the N-acetylated derivative {{in the presence of}} acetyl CoA, confirming that an N-acetyltransferase is responsible for the bacterial biotransformations. Approximately 25 % of drugs and 30 % of agrochemicals contain fluorine, and the trifluoromethyl group is a prominent feature of many of these since it improves lipophilicity and stability. The pentafluorosulfanyl substituent is seen as an improvement on the trifluoromethyl group and research efforts are underway to develop synthetic methods to incorporate this moiety into biologically active compounds. It is important to determine the potential environmental impact of these compounds, including the potential biotransformation reactions that may occur when they are exposed to microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Unusual N–N {{coupling}} of aryl azides {{to yield}} azoarenes {{is demonstrated by}} the Ru(I) metalloradical, [SiP^(iPr) _ 3]Ru(N_ 2) (4) ([SiP^(iPr) _ 3] = (2 -iPr_(2) PC_(6) H_(4)) _(3) Si^–). The yield of the azoarene {{is dependent on the}} substituent on the aryl azide, and the reaction is catalytic for <b>p-methoxy</b> and p-ethoxy <b>phenyl</b> azides, while no azoarene is observed for p-trifluoromethylphenyl azide. Studies aimed at probing the viability of a bimolecular coupling mechanism of metal imide species, as shown in the related [SiP^(iPr) _ 3]Fe system, have led to the isolation of several structurally unusual complexes including the ruthenium(IV) imide, 7 -OMe, as well as the Ru(II) azide adduct 8 -OMe. One electron reduction of 7 -OMe complex led to the isolation of the formally Ru(III) imide complex, [SiP^(iPr) _ 3]Ru(NAr) (Ar = p-MeOC_(6) H_(4), 5 -OMe). EPR spectroscopy on 5 -OMe suggests that the complex is electronically similar to the previously reported imide complex, [SiP^(iPr) _ 3]Ru(NAr) (Ar = p-CF_(3) C_(6) H_(4), 5 -CF_(3)), and features radical character on the NAr moiety, but to a greater degree. The stability of 5 -OMe establishes that bimolecular coupling of 5 -OMe is kinetically inconsistent with the reaction. Further studies rule out mechanisms in which 5 -OMe reacts directly with free aryl azide or a transient Ru(I) azide adduct. Together, these studies show that 5 -OMe is likely uninvolved in the catalytic cycle and demonstrates the influence of the metal center on the mechanism of reaction. Instead, we favor a mechanism in which free aryl nitrene is released during the catalytic cycle and combines with itself or with free aryl azide to yield the azoarene...|$|R
