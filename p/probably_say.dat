500|$|After the season, Hornish {{remained}} {{optimistic about}} an eventual IndyCar return: [...] "I hope they move the schedule so that somebody could do it. That's my goal. If I never {{ran in the}} Indy 500 again or an IndyCar Series race I would <b>probably</b> <b>say</b> I would be disappointed about that." [...] He received offers to return after his departure, and in late 2008 was rumored to be returning to replace Hélio Castroneves the next season due to Castroneves' IRS problems. Castroneves was eventually cleared, missing only the season opener with Will Power driving for Penske during his absence. In November 2013, Hornish declined an offer to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the upcoming season after Dario Franchitti's career-ending injuries at the 2013 Shell-Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston.|$|E

Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit.

500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I think even the Barnsley fans would <b>probably</b> <b>say</b> they liked to see what he was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd <b>probably</b> <b>say</b> something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

Since the Middle Ages there have been regular attempts to ban the peasants' grape from the soils of France, which <b>probably</b> <b>says</b> something about its typical winemaking qualities. However, Gouais blanc has continued to be commercially grown at several vineyards in Switzerland and in recent years, a few historically interested wine producers have started to plant small amounts of Gouais blanc.

2500|$|Webcomics {{have been}} seen by some artists as a {{potential}} new path towards syndication in newspapers, but attempts have rarely proven lucrative. According to Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content), [...] "there's no real money" [...] in syndication for webcomic artists. For instance Jeffrey Rowland uploaded his webcomics to the internet {{in order to gain}} constructive criticism after being rejected from various syndicates in 1999, but eventually found that he didn't need to get his work syndicated when he started selling merchandise of his webcomic Wigu. To The Boston Globe, Rowland said that [...] "if a syndicate came to me and offered me a hundred newspapers, I would <b>probably</b> <b>say</b> no... I'd probably make less money, with more work." [...] When Diesel Sweeties found syndication by United Media in 2007, its creator Richard Stevens still made 80% of his income through his website. Other webcomic creators, such as R. K. Milholland (Something Positive) and Michael Terracciano (Dominic Deegan), wouldn't be able to syndicate their work in newspaper because they fill up a specific niche and wouldn't be accepted by a broader audience. Some webcartoonists have proven more successful with newspaper syndication since: in 2015, Dana Simpson syndicated her webcomic Phoebe and Her Unicorn through Universal Uclick to over 100 newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|Greg Shipperd {{publicly}} {{suggested that}} Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper {{for the upcoming}} West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania. However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice. In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman. [...] "...It was like all my birthdays had come at once. I had some reservations about making my Test debut against arguably the best fast bowling attack in the world", Ponting later said. The West Indies had been cricket's powerhouse for close to two decades and teams included many feared fast bowlers. Before the tour, Australian captain Mark Taylor thought the last Test batting vacancy was possibly between Ponting and Justin Langer. [...] "Ricky Ponting is more the stroke player while Justin is the tough man. It depends on what we need at the time but you can <b>probably</b> <b>say</b> Ricky has his neck in front because he's been on this tour [...] ", Taylor said. Rod Marsh believed Ponting's attitude and fearless approach could tear the West Indies apart. Nevertheless, Ponting {{did not expect to}} be selected. Steve Waugh noted that Ponting would [...] "not be intimidated by the West Indians' inevitable waist-to-chin length." [...] During the series, Ponting said the current crop of bowlers were not [...] "of the same high class" [...] that opposition teams had come to expect from the West Indies.|$|E

[...] That said, there may be a number of elements of achievement that may make finding a state of personal contentment easier: a strong family unit, a strong local community, and satisfaction of life's basic needs as perhaps expressed in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In general, the more needs in Maslow's hierarchy are achieved, the more easily one might achieve contentment.|$|R

For in the oldest Roman calendars which date from the time of the Decemvirs (cf. Mommsen, Die röm. Chronologie, &c. p. 30) these festivals are not engraved in capitals but in small characters, so they must be additions made after 449 BC. Also, in 322 BC, the ludi Romani are mentioned as a regular annual festival, so they must have finally become established between these dates; and the year 367 BC, when so many changes were effected, and when we are told a day was added to these games and curule aediles appointed to superintend them, seems the most reasonable to assume.|$|R
