5|$|After the English Reformation Northern England {{became a}} centre of Catholicism, and Irish {{immigration}} increased its numbers further, especially in North West cities like Liverpool and Manchester. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area underwent a religious revival that ultimately produced Primitive Methodism, {{and at its}} <b>peak,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, Methodism was the dominant faith in much of Northern England.|$|E

5|$|Kauri gum was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were exported. The <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{also took}} to the sea, and from the 650s on, the entire Mediterranean Sea became a battleground, with raids and counter-raids being {{launched}} against islands and the coastal settlements.

40|$|Computational {{models are}} used to {{investigate}} the role of electron-electron interactions in cross-sectional STM of cleaved quantum dots. If correlation effects are weak, the tunnelling current reflects the nodal structure of the non-interacting dot states. If correlation is strong, <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current for tunnelling out of the dot tend to coincide with <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electron density, while the current for tunnelling into the dot tends to be largest between <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electron density...|$|R

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after the <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in}} the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{brightness of the}} nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by {{the gravity of the}} Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Attendance {{levels at}} Andover's matches reached a <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s. During the 1969–70 season, home attendances at league matches {{averaged}} over 550, {{with the largest}} crowd being the 2,144 people who watched their FA Cup match against local rivals Salisbury. In the years following their promotion to the Southern League, average attendances started to drop until they dipped below the 200 mark during the 1970s. Since then, the average attendance at Andover's matches has remained at approximately 140, although this figure dipped below 100 in the 1999–2000 season following their last relegation from the Southern League. Just three seasons later however, this figure had risen to just under 200 following the club's second consecutive Wessex League championship and successes in cup competitions.|$|E
5|$|Before Selena {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract in 1989 with EMI Latin, she had hinted {{that she wanted}} to start recording in English. She was asked to make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing that Selena should first strengthen her fan base. Later, after releasing five Spanish-language albums that all achieved unprecedented milestones in the Latin music industry, Koppelman considered that Selena had reached her <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spanish market, and he began preparations for a crossover album.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E

This portrays a rugged range with the highest <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
