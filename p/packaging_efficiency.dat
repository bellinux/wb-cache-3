By adding micrometric zirconia particles, the light scattering is enhanced, that induces a decrease of phosphor necessary to obtain a specific CCT. The optical model is able to determine the optical properties (CCT, angular CCT distribution, chromaticity and <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency)</b> in a hemisphere LED for various amount of YAG-phosphor and ZrO 2 -zirconia particles. Based on previous process, the work is in {{the first step to}} fit the effective radius and refractive index that will be implemented in the optical model. In the second step, the optical model is compared with the experimental measurement to determine the absorption coefficient and conversion efficiency of a package of silicone resin containing phosphor and zirconia. Finally, the model, confirmed by selected experimental results, allows determining the optical properties of any king of package that lead to a CCT emission ranging from 4500 K to 6500 K. The analysis of these data is interpreted by comparing, for a specific CCT, the phosphor loss, the <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the angular distribution of CCT.

Limited in vitro <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency</b> has hampered progress toward this end, however. It {{has been suggested that}} limited <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency</b> is related to poor activity of purified procapsids. We describe the construction of a vector that expresses λ procapsids with a yield that is 40 -fold greater than existing systems. Consistent with previous studies, packaging of a mature λ genome is very inefficient in vitro, with only 4 % of the input procapsids utilized. Concatemeric DNA is the preferred packaging substrate in vivo, and procapsids interact with a nucleoprotein complex known as complex I to initiate genome packaging. When complex I is used as a packaging substrate in vitro, capsid utilization is extremely efficient, and 40 % of the input DNA is packaged. Finally, we provide evidence for a packaging-stimulated ATPase activity, and kinetically characterize this reaction quantifying the energetic cost of DNA packaging in bacteriophage λ...|$|E

HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 have {{significant differences in the}} mechanisms of viral RNA encapsidation. Therefore, the RNA packaging mechanisms of SIVagm cannot be predicted from the studies of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. We examined the roles of the nucleocapsid (NC) zinc finger motifs on RNA packaging by mutating the conserved zinc finger (CCHC) motifs, and whether SIVagm has a preference to package RNA in cis by comparing the RNA <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of gag mutants {{in the presence of a}} wild-type vector. Our results indicate that the SIVagm NC domain plays an important role in Gag–RNA recognition; furthermore SIVagm is distinct from the other currently known primate lentiviruses as destroying either zinc finger motif in the NC causes very drastic RNA packaging defects.

To support this need, concepts for telescopes with apertures of 100 meters are being investigated, but the required technologies are not in hand today. Due to the capacity limits of launch vehicles, the idea of deploying, erecting, or inflating large structures in space is being considered.

Mutations that reduce RNA <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency</b> have been localized to the highly basic nucleocapsid (NC) p 7 domain of Pr 55 Gag, but {{the importance of the}} basic amino acid residues in specific viral RNA encapsidation and infectivity has not been thoroughly investigated in vivo. We have systematically substituted the positively charged residues of the NC domain of Pr 55 Gag in an HIV- 1 viral clone by using alanine scanning mutagenesis and have assayed the effects of these mutations on virus replication, particle formation, and RNA packaging in vivo. Analysis of viral clones with single substitutions revealed that certain charged amino acid residues are more critical for RNA <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiency</b> and infectivity than others. Analysis of viral clones with multiple substitutions indicates that the presence of positive charge in each of three independent domains [...] the zinc-binding domains, the basic region that links them, and the residues that Hank the two zinc-binding domains [...] is necessary for efficient HIV- 1 RNA packaging.

40|$|Abstract. Advances in planar {{magnetic}} {{technology have}} resulted in the development of high speed, high power density, magnetic components for use in electrical power converters. In particular, the use of such components will result in a substantial reduction in transformer and inductor volumes, and will encourage development of low-profile, lightweight, efficient power converters that conform readily to printed circuit topologies. This paper describes a single, plasma-spray fabrication process, which overcomes many of the problems associated with integration of components produced by multiple manufacturers. The feasibility of monolithic magnetic technology has been shown by integrating all the magnetic components of a 100 Watt, 1 MHz, DC-DC forward converter into a single, monolithic, non-magnetic module, 5 Imm x 51 mm x 5 mm. The process involves plasma deposition of variable-permeability, ultra-low-loss, substituted ferrites that serve as cores for magnetic components. Non-magnetic regions of the modules serve as windings windows, inductor air gaps, isolations or a s mounting substrate for other system components. The significance of the technology is its compatibility with semiconductor integrated circuitry, increased volumetric <b>package</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and reduction of overall manufacturing cost, size and weight of power electronic systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{analyses}} {{have demonstrated}} that packaging of the adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) genome is dependent on at least seven cis-acting elements, called AI to AVII, which {{are located in the}} left-end region of the genome. These elements have different <b>packaging</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> and without AI through AV, viral DNA cannot be packaged. Here we report the identification of the cis-acting Ad 5 packaging domain in vivo by using the Cre/loxP system. We found that an adenoviral DNA fragment (nt 192 to nt 358), which includes elements AI to AV, is excised by Cre recombinase and packaged into capsids. Furthermore, this mutant adenovirus replicated so efficiently by repetitive propagation that its purification by CsCI equilibrium gradient was possible. This study clarified that the region from nt 358 to nt 454 on the viral genome is sufficient for packaging. Recently, the helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd) construction system has been developed for the purpose of gene therapy. This system uses a helper virus with two parallel loxP sites flanking the packaging signal. This region is eliminated by Cre-mediated excision, which prevents helper virus packaging. Our data provide useful information regarding factors affecting efficient elimination...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses creating portable {{and efficient}} parallel programs for scientific computing. Both of these aspects are important. Portability means {{the program can}} execute on any parallel machine. Efficiency means {{there is little or}} no penalty for using our solution instead of hand-coded, architecture-specific programs. Although parallel programming is necessarily more difficult than sequential programming, it is currently more complicated than it has to be. The Filaments package provides fine-grain parallelism and a shared memory programming model. It can be viewed as a "least common denominator" for parallel scientific computing. Fine-grain parallelism supports any number (even thousands) of threads, and shared memory provides a natural programming model. Consequently, the combination allows the programmer to concentrate on the application and not the architecture of the target machine. The Filaments package makes extensive use of run-time decision making. Run-time decision making has several advantages. First, it is often possible to make a better decision because more information is available at run time. Second, run-time decision making can obviate the need for complex, often intractable, static analysis. Moreover, run-time decision making leads to much of the <b>package's</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
