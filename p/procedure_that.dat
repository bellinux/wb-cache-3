5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} nultipoint regression methods {{to a variety of}} situations that involve nonlinear kinetic data, and illustrates advantages that can be achieved with these data—processing methods. Examples include kinetic <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> are virtually indepen— dent of variations in experimental parameters such as temperature, pH, reagent concentration, etc., kinetic <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> have substantially increased linear ranges, <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> can resolve two—component mixtures such as unconjugated and conjugated bilirubins or the H and M subunits of lactate dehydrogenase, <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> can compensate for substrate inhibition in the quantitation of enzyme activity, and <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> have the potential to yield linear (not &quot;linearized&quot;) calibration curves in competitive binding inununoassays. Data are presented to illustrate most of these points...|$|R

5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The {{procedures}} failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

Most useful for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5.

5|$|Parsons {{participated in}} the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, flying on the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer.

It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, {{who was in charge}} of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For his work on the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> {{permanently}} {{eliminates the}} pleural space and attaches the lung {{to the chest}} wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> could be used in what type of case.|$|E

5|$|U-1 {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable pitch propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that allowed travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. This arrangement required mechanical pumping, a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> took 8 minutes. U-1s propulsion system consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged.|$|E

Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences.
