40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to: (1) {{identify}} components of school-community relations that involve administrative functions, public participation and political processes; (2) develop a practical process for improvement of school-community relations; and (3) offer strategies for implementing a positive school-community relations process. Review of literature identified three concepts of school-community relations: (1) development of school-community relations; (2) perspectives of school-community relations; and (3) approaches to the improvement of school-community relations. The three concepts were researched regarding the administrative functions, public participation, and political processes. The concepts were utilized to identify components and theoretical models to formulate a practical <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> for improvement of school-community relations. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> utilized the administrative, public participation and political dimensions as a basis for developing procedures for improvement of school-community relations. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> format consisted of six sequential processes: (1) initial planning, (2) statement of purpose and reassessment of mission, (3) assessment of community needs and desires, (4) decision-making strategies, (5) developing implementation strategies, and (6) evaluation and audit processes. Assessment of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> was conducted through utilization of a review panel selected from nationally recognized authorities in school-community relations. The review panel consisted of five individuals willing to critically review the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> and respond to an openended evaluation instrument. The responses from the review panel were organized into component categories consistent with the structure of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> and utilized to evaluate the model as a viable resource for public school administrators. A comparison of item-by-item response did not yield lack of concurrence of respondents strong enough to warrant major revision of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan.</b> A general observation was that experience with implementation would readily identify weaknesses. Responses by the review panel indicated that the more significant components of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> were: the organization, sequential progression, and goals which provided direction for many school-community areas; the administrative responsibilities and accountability component provided clear lines of reporting; and considerable degree of benefit could transpire when the community was involved. Several modifications to the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> were generated by conducting the study. In addition to vital as the modifications generated by analysis of responses by the review panel several modifications resulted from experiences of conducting the research coupled with doctoral committee member interaction. Based upon the findings of the study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The school-community relations concept encompasses a wide range of components, such as administrative function, public participation, and political processes. 2. School administrators generally have given low priority to school-community relations concepts. 3. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> will assist school administrators in implementing a continuous schoolcommunity relations program. 4. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> is one feasible alternative for improvement of school-community relations. 5. The data provided will generate increased awareness of the value of positive school community relations on the part of individuals who choose to read the study. 6.

40|$|Problem: The <b>process</b> <b>planning</b> {{task for}} a given design problem in {{additive}} manufacturing can be greatly enhanced by referencing previously developed <b>process</b> <b>plans.</b> However, identifying appropriate <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> for the given design problem requires appropriate mapping between the design domain and the <b>process</b> <b>planning</b> domain. Hence, {{the objective of this}} research is to establish mathematical mapping between the design domain and the <b>process</b> <b>planning</b> domain such that the previously developed appropriate <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> can be identified for the given design task. Further more, identification of an appropriate mathematical theory that enables computational mapping between the two domains is of interest. Through such computational mapping, previously developed <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> are expected to be shared in a distributed environment using an open repository. Approach: The design requirements and <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> are discretized using empirical models that compute exact values of process variables for the given design requirements. Through this discretization, subsumption relations among the discretized design requirements and <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> are identified. Appropriate <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> {{for a given}} design requirement are identified by subsumption relations in the design requirements. Also, the design requirements that can be satisfied by the given <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> are identified by subsumption relations among the <b>process</b> <b>plans.</b> To computationally realize such mapping, a description logic (ALE) is identified and justified to represent and compute subsumption relation. Based on this investigation, a retrieval method (DFM framework) is realized that enables storage and retrieval of <b>process</b> <b>plans.</b> Validation: Theoretical and empirical validations are performed using the validation square method. For the theoretical validation, an appropriate description logic (ALE) is identified and justified. Also, subsumption utilization in mapping two domains and realizing the DFM framework is justified. For the empirical validation, the storing and retrieval performance of the DFM framework is tested to demonstrate its theoretical validity. Contribution:	In this research, two areas of contributions are identified: DFM and engineering information management. In DFM, the retrieval method that relates the design problem to appropriate <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> through mathematical mapping between design and <b>process</b> <b>planning</b> domain is the major contribution. In engineering information management, the major contributions are the development of information models and the identification of their characteristics. Based on this investigation, an appropriate description logic (ALE) is selected and justified. Also, corresponding computational feasibility (non deterministic polynomial time) of subsumption is identified. Ph. D.

In a {{manufacturing}} environment, productivity {{and quality of}} the system can be improved by focusing on production constraints (bottlenecks). As a result, the bottleneck detection methods have gained more importance in enhancing the performance of the system. There are several short-term and long-term bottleneck detection methods. This research focuses on inactive state duration bottleneck detection for multiple product flow as high complexity arises in material flow due to several products and different processing sequences. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is validated by case studies using discrete event simulation models. The integration of simulation tool to detect bottlenecks in the manufacturing system has been useful in real-time case studies. An automatic bottleneck detection method was proposed to identify the bottleneck time and bottleneck machines in an easier manner. Previous research focuses on additional capacity and buffers to machines to mitigate the bottleneck. This approach spotlights the selection of alternative <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> in the presence of bottlenecks with a objective of minimized bottleneck time and minimized machining cost of the products in the given <b>process</b> <b>plan.</b> A mathematical model was presented with these objectives.
