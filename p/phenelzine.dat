25|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> is {{more prone}} than {{tranylcypromine}} {{and most other}} antidepressant to causing liver damage.|$|E
25|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. tranylcypromine (Parnate), <b>phenelzine</b> (Nardil), >10mg selegiline) or digitalis glycosides {{is an absolute}} contraindication.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} cases where other {{hydrazine}} derivative drugs, {{such as the}} MAOI antidepressant iproniazid, are associated with liver damage. <b>Phenelzine</b> {{has been associated with}} abnormal liver tests. Toxic effects can develop from antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Marmite {{should be}} avoided if a person takes a MAOI antidepressant, such as <b>phenelzine</b> (Nardil) or {{tranylcypromine}} (Parnate), as yeast extracts interact negatively with these types of medications due to their tyramine content.|$|E
25|$|Iprindole {{has been}} shown to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of the aromatic hydroxylation and/or N-dealkylation-mediated metabolism of many substances including, but not limited to octopamine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, fenfluramine, <b>phenelzine,</b> tranylcypromine, trimipramine, and fluoxetine, likely via inactivating cytochrome P450 enzymes. It also inhibits its own metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications include prior {{treatment}} (within {{the past}} two weeks) with MAOIs such as <b>phenelzine</b> and tranylcypromine, due to the potential for serotonin syndrome. Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine {{or any of the}} other ingredients in the formulation used. Its use in those concurrently receiving pimozide or thioridazine is also advised against.|$|E
25|$|Concerns exist when ginseng is used chronically, {{potentially}} causing {{side effects}} such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems. The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescribed medications {{is believed to}} be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with the blood thinner, warfarin. Ginseng has been shown to have adverse drug reactions with <b>phenelzine.</b> A potential interaction has also been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine.|$|E
25|$|This {{inhibition}} of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes {{in the stomach}} and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like <b>phenelzine</b> and tranylcypromine, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, <b>phenelzine,</b> procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} drug {{interactions}} can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Concurrent use of MDMA high dosages with another serotonergic drug {{can result in}} a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as <b>phenelzine</b> (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix).|$|E
25|$|Alarm pheromone-induced {{anxiety in}} rats {{has been used}} to {{evaluate}} the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, <b>phenelzine</b> (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Other {{prescription}} drugs are also used, if other methods are not effective. Before {{the introduction of}} SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as <b>phenelzine</b> were frequently used {{in the treatment of}} social anxiety. Evidence continues to indicate that MAOIs are effective in the treatment and management of social anxiety disorder and they are still used, but generally {{only as a last resort}} medication, owing to concerns about dietary restrictions, possible adverse drug interactions and a recommendation of multiple doses per day. A newer type of this medication, Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase subtype A (RIMAs) such as the drug moclobemide, bind reversibly to the MAO-A enzyme, greatly reducing the risk of hypertensive crisis with dietary tyramine intake.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as <b>phenelzine</b> due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{primidone}} with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), <b>phenelzine</b> (Nardil), procarbazine (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), tranylcypromine (Parnate) or {{within two weeks}} of stopping {{any one of them}} may [...] the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone.|$|E
2500|$|Clomipramine may {{interact}} {{with a number}} of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, <b>phenelzine,</b> selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine {{due to the fact that}} clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 [...] ) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> {{has also}} been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Transaminases such as GABA-transaminase {{have been shown to}} be {{dependent}} upon vitamin B6 and may be involved in a potentially related process, since the <b>phenelzine</b> metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA transaminase inhibitor. Both <b>phenelzine</b> and vitamin B6 are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. For this reason, it may be recommended to supplement with vitamin B6 while taking <b>phenelzine.</b> The pyridoxine form of B6 is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from <b>phenelzine</b> and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> is metabolized {{primarily}} in the liver and its metabolites are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of <b>phenelzine</b> in the urine {{over the course of}} 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N2-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. <b>Phenelzine</b> may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of <b>phenelzine,</b> as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> is {{administered}} orally {{in the form}} of <b>phenelzine</b> sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes and half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, <b>phenelzine</b> irreversibly disables MAO, and as a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon <b>phenelzine</b> treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not actually wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2-3 weeks.|$|E
50|$|As is {{the case}} with other MAOIs, there is a concern {{regarding}} <b>phenelzine</b> and the use of both local and general anesthetics. Anyone taking <b>phenelzine</b> should inform their psychiatrist before proceeding with dental surgery, and surgery in any other contexts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> and its {{metabolites}} also inhibit {{at least}} two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are alanine transaminase (ALA-T), and γ-Aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the latter of which is not caused by <b>phenelzine</b> itself, but by a <b>phenelzine</b> metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, <b>phenelzine</b> causes an increase in the alanine and GABA levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine's action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including <b>phenelzine)</b> which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of hepatitis and liver failure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> is used {{primarily}} {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with depressive symptomology characterized as [...] "atypical", [...] "nonendogenous", and/or [...] "neurotic" [...] respond particularly well to <b>phenelzine.</b> The medication is also useful in patients who do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression, or are [...] "treatment-resistant". In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, <b>phenelzine</b> is effective in treating dysthymia, bipolar depression (BD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E

5000|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. tranylcypromine (Parnate), <b>phenelzine</b> (Nardil), >10 mg selegiline) or digitalis glycosides {{is an absolute}} contraindication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> (Nardil, Nardelzine) is a non-selective and {{irreversible}} {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine class {{which is used}} as an antidepressant and anxiolytic. Along with tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid, <b>phenelzine</b> {{is one of the}} few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use. It is typically available in 15 mg tablets and doses usually range from 30-90 mg per day, with 15 mg every day or every other day suggested as a maintenance dose following a successful course of treatment.|$|E
50|$|Iproniazid is {{no longer}} used because it caused an {{unacceptable}} incidence in jaundice. Nevertheless related agents such as <b>phenelzine</b> and isocarboxazid {{are still on the}} market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenelzine</b> {{has also}} been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA). PEA acts as a {{releasing}} agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, and produces effects very similar to those of amphetamine, though with markedly different pharmacokinetics such as a far shorter duration of action. Phenelzine's enhancement of PEA levels may contribute further to its overall antidepressant effects to some degree. In addition, phenethylamine is a substrate for MAO-B, and treatment with MAOIs that inhibit MAO-B such as <b>phenelzine</b> have been shown to consistently and significantly elevate its concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{and general}} {{anesthetic}} in surgery and dentistry, in particular those containing epinephrine. There is no universally taught or accepted practice regarding dentistry {{and use of}} MAOIs such as <b>phenelzine,</b> and therefore {{it is vital to}} inform all clinicians, especially dentists, of the potential effect of MAOIs and local anesthesia. In preparation for dental work, withdrawal from <b>phenelzine</b> is specifically advised, however since this takes two weeks it is not always a desirable or practical option. Dentists using local anesthesia are advised to use a non-epinephrine anesthetic such as mepivacaine at a level of 3%. Specific attention should be paid to blood pressure during the procedure, and the level of the anesthetic should be regularly and appropriately topped-up, for non-epinephrine anesthetics take longer to come into effect and wear off faster. Patients taking <b>phenelzine</b> are advised to notify their psychiatrist prior to any dental treatment.|$|E
