50|$|It is {{critical}} to maintain food safety during processing, packaging, storage, logistics (including cold chain), sale, and use. Conformance to applicable regulations is mandatory. Some are country specific such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Agriculture; others are regional such as the European Food Safety Authority. Certification {{programs such as the}} Global Food Safety Initiative are sometimes used. Food packaging considerations may include: use of hazard analysis and critical control points, verification and validation protocols, Good manufacturing practices, use of an effective quality management system, track and trace systems, and requirements for label content. Special food contact materials are used when the package is in direct contact with the food product. Depending on the <b>packaging</b> <b>operation</b> and the food, packaging machinery often needs specified daily wash-down and cleaning procedures.|$|E

The control system acts on the controlled joint stiffness {{in such a way that}} the contact force, in the Cartesian Space, will be parallel to the displacement of the contact point. Such feature minimizes friction and wear during packaging operations and minimize tangential reactions...|$|E

40|$|Random bin picking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} industrial robotics applications available. It constitutes a complicated interaction between the vision system, robot, and control system. For a <b>packaging</b> <b>operation</b> requiring a pick-and-place task, the robot system utilized should be able to perform certain functions for recognizing the applicable target object from randomized objects in a bin. In this paper, we introduce a robotic vision system for bin picking using industrial dual-arm robots. The proposed system recognizes the best object from randomized target candidates based on stereo vision, and estimates the position and orientation of the object. It then sends the result to the robot control system. The system was developed for use in the packaging process of cell phone accessories using dual-arm robots...|$|E
