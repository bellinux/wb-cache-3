40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of <b>proof</b> (or acceptance) <b>test</b> data during the {{reliability}} based design optimization of structural components. It is assumed that every component will be <b>proof</b> <b>tested</b> and that the component will only enter into service if it passes the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The goal {{is to reduce the}} component weight, while maintaining high reliability, by exploiting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> results during the design process. The proposed procedure results in the simultaneous design of the structural component and the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> itself and provides the designer with direct control over the probability of failing the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The procedure is illustrated using two analytical example problems and the results indicate that significant weight savings are possible when exploiting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> results during the design process...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} failure of optical fibers must be avoided to ensure reliability of fiber-based systems. The first stress event in a fiber’s lifetime is the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> will alter the fiber’s strength distribution for all subsequent processing and applications. Thus {{it is critical}} to know the fiber strength distribution after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> (post-proof strength distribution). It is generally assumed that the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> truncates the strength distribution at the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level. But, many users are concerned because they know that theoretically {{it has been shown that}} after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> the strength of fiber may be much less than the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level, and that the minimum post-proof strength is determined only by the unloading rate during the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> But this theoretical result is not consistent with historical field data. Historically no one has documented failures stresses below the proof stress level. This dissertation resolves this apparent contradiction by reviewing the theory and conducting a probabilistic assessment. As optical fibers are used more and more in computer and switching gear backplanes, a new potential mechanical reliability problem arises due to the necessar...|$|R

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study for the}} optimization of periodic <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> for fatigue-critical structures is presented. The optimal proof load level and the optimal number of periodic <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> are determined by minimizing the total expected (statistical average) cost, while the constraint on the allowable level of structural reliability is satisfied. The total expected cost consists of the expected cost of <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> the expected cost of structures destroyed by <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> and the expected cost of structural failure in service. It is demonstrated by numerical examples that significant cost saving and reliability improvement for fatigue-critical structures {{can be achieved by}} the application of the optimal periodic <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The present study is relevant to the establishment of optimal maintenance procedures for fatigue-critical structures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile load <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> procedures are studied so that the value derived from <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> can be maximized. Whether or not a <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> load <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> load for <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

50|$|<b>Proof</b> <b>testing</b> {{initially}} {{took place}} in an area known as the 'Artillery Garden' {{just north of the}} Tower of London (the Board's headquarters), and the Master Gunner of England was provided with an official residence nearby. As weapons were growing more powerful, however, it became desirable for them to be proved in less populated areas, and this (among other things) led to the Crown in the 1670s purchasing an area of open land known as the Warren, at Woolwich in Kent, on the south bank of the Thames (the area soon developed into a centre for arms manufacture, and was later renamed the Royal Arsenal). In 1685 the Artillery Garden was sold, and the Master Gunner himself moved to the Warren, where he was housed on site (along with the local Ordnance Storekeeper) in a Tudor mansion known as Tower Place. (<b>Proof</b> <b>testing</b> of guns and artillery continued at the Woolwich site until the mid-19th century, at which point this activity was (once again) moved to a larger and less populated area: to Shoeburyness on the Essex coast.) The last Master Gunner to reside at Woolwich (Col. George Brown) died in 1702; his successor (Capt. Thomas Silver) already held the office of Master Gunner of Whitehall & St James's Park, and as such he continued to reside in the Gun House by the Park.|$|E
