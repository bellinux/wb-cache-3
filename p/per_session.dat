Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage <b>per</b> <b>session</b> was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more <b>per</b> <b>session</b> than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

The characteristics of patients were as follows—sex ratio at 1, age (SD) 64.3 (9.0), weight 83.3  kg (17.2), SAPSII score 48.3 (13.6). 20 patients on 23 {{were taken in}} charge for fluid overload.

25|$|A1 Grand Prix used {{a unique}} {{qualifying}} format, which began at 14:00 local {{time on the}} Saturday of the race weekend, to determine the grid lineup for Sunday's races, the Sprint Race and the Main Race. The qualifying period was split into four, ten-minute sessions. Each car was permitted three laps <b>per</b> <b>session,</b> including the laps required for leaving the pits, and for re-entering it. This allowed one lap to set a competitive time. There was a five-minute break between sessions, which added up {{to a total of}} 55 minutes for qualifying. The grid for the Sprint Race was set based on the cars' fastest time from either the first or the second session. The grid for the Feature Race was determined the same way, but using sessions three and four. However, if there was a red flag due to an accident on the circuit, the timing to the end of qualifying continued to run.|$|E

A second caution flag was shown at noon local time to allow for an inspection of the track; 30 minutes later the session came to an end.

In the break between school years, Ross instituted a number of changes.

The minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15, and Ross now personally interviewed all prospective students {{to determine if they}} should be admitted. Fees and expenses rose by $10 <b>per</b> <b>session,</b> and the number of hours required for graduation increased, including additional hours in English grammar, sciences, mathematics, and history.

500|$|Melwood was {{overgrown}} and {{had only}} an old wooden cricket pavilion. One of the pitches [...] "looked as if bombs had been dropped on it" [...] and Shankly asked if the Germans had [...] "been over" [...] in the war. He instituted a development program to cultivate the site and modernise the facilities and, in the meantime, arranged for the players to meet and change at Anfield before going to and from Melwood by bus. According to biographer Stephen Kelly, Liverpool's eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly, Paisley, Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood. Shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that, apart from warm-up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries, the players trained on grass using a ball. Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups {{with the purpose of}} achieving set targets. Five-a-side games, as at all Shankly's earlier clubs, were {{at the heart of the}} system and he insisted on these being as competitive as league matches. One particular routine designed to develop stamina, reflexes and ball skills was the [...] "sweat box" [...] which Shankly described as [...] "using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next; the ball was played against the boards, you controlled it, turned around and took it again". Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills. After experimenting with the routine, he set the players a limit of two minutes <b>per</b> <b>session.</b> The system was geared to Shankly's simple philosophy of [...] "pass and move", which formed the basis of Liverpool's strategy. Shankly insisted on suitable cooling-off periods after training (now called [...] "warming down") before the players took a bath and had a meal. The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions. Shankly summarised the entire strategy as: [...] "attention to detail; we never left anything to chance".|$|E

The monetary cost can amount to $90–$120 <b>per</b> <b>session</b> for general therapy, or much higher fees for specialized coaching. The availability of anger management programs locally can be problematic for more isolated areas, creating an additional cost for travel.
