5|$|A <b>plutoid</b> or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term <b>plutoid</b> {{was adopted by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature. The term <b>plutoid</b> is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a <b>plutoid,</b> and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is probably a captured <b>plutoid</b> from the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes. Therefore, the IAU announced in 2008 that for naming purposes, a trans-Neptunian object will be {{assumed to be a}} <b>plutoid</b> if it has an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 magnitude.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plutoids</b> are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of <b>plutoids</b> are not <b>plutoids</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|This {{decision}} {{allowed for}} the naming of Makemake and Haumea, and their formal recognition as <b>plutoids</b> and dwarf planets, bringing the number of IAU-accepted <b>plutoids</b> to four. However, the (co)discoverer of Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, Mike Brown, estimates that between 100 and 400 known bodies are <b>plutoids,</b> {{and that there are}} many more that have yet to be discovered. See list of possible dwarf planets.|$|R
5|$|There {{are thought}} to be {{thousands}} of <b>plutoids</b> in the Solar System, although only four have been formally designated as such by the IAU.|$|R
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It {{is highly unlikely that}} any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, if it turns out upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} <b>plutoid</b> has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a <b>plutoid,</b> a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E
500|$|On June 11, 2008, the IAU Executive Committee {{announced}} a name, <b>plutoid,</b> and a definition: all trans-Neptunian dwarf planets are plutoids.

500|$|With the {{creation}} of the term [...] "dwarf planet", some ambiguity was created as to which of two IAU bodies would be responsible for naming dwarf planets. Eris had been named through the IAU Committee on Small Body Nomenclature and the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature working in cooperation with one another. Along with announcing the name [...] "plutoid", the IAU decision of 11 June 2008 institutionalized this cooperative process involving the two bodies in the naming of new <b>plutoids.</b> In keeping with minor planet naming guidelines, priority will be given to names proposed by the discovery teams, and <b>plutoids</b> may not share a name with a small Solar System body.|$|R
50|$|Collaborating with Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo of the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team, he {{has participated}} in the {{discovery}} of several <b>plutoids</b> such as 90377 Sedna (possibly the first known inner Oort cloud object), 90482 Orcus, Eris (more massive than Pluto), , and , although he would not get credit for Haumea.|$|R
500|$|... "Ice dwarf" [...] as a {{term for}} an icy {{planetary}} body that generally orbits beyond Neptune was coined {{as part of a}} conception of a threefold division of the Solar System into inner terrestrial planets, central gas giants, and outer ice dwarfs, of which Pluto was the principal member. This conception foreshadowed the reclassification of Pluto to dwarf planet and <b>plutoid</b> after the discovery of Eris.|$|E
500|$|Eris is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet (<b>plutoid).</b> Its orbital {{characteristics}} {{more specifically}} categorize it as a scattered-disk object (SDO), or a TNO {{that has been}} [...] "scattered" [...] from the Kuiper belt into more-distant and unusual orbits following gravitational interactions with Neptune as the Solar System was forming. Although its high orbital inclination is unusual among the known SDOs, theoretical models suggest that objects that were originally near the inner edge of the Kuiper belt were scattered into orbits with higher inclinations than objects from the outer belt. Inner-belt objects {{are expected to be}} generally more massive than outer-belt objects, and so astronomers expect to discover more large objects like Eris in high-inclination orbits, which have traditionally been neglected.|$|E
500|$|On June 11, 2008, the IAU {{executive}} committee announced {{the establishment of}} a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned [...] "new category of trans-Neptunian objects" [...] to which Pluto is a prototype. This new class of objects, termed plutoids, would include Pluto, Eris and any other future trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU also determined that, for naming purposes, only those TNOs with an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 would be allowed into the category. To date, only two other TNOs, 2003EL61 and 2005FY9, meet the absolute magnitude requirement, while other potential dwarf planets, such as Sedna, Orcus and Quaoar, do not. On July 11, 2008, the Working Group on Planetary Nomenclature included 2005FY9 in the <b>plutoid</b> class, naming it Makemake. On September 17, 2008, 2003EL61 joined the category with the name Haumea.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial planets have {{numerous}} {{similarities to}} <b>plutoids</b> (objects like Pluto), which {{also have a}} solid surface, but are primarily composed of icy materials. During {{the formation of the}} Solar System, there were probably many more (planetesimals), but they have all merged with or been destroyed by the four remaining worlds in the solar nebula.|$|R
50|$|The {{region of}} the Solar System beyond Neptune {{contains}} sparse populations of relatively small rocky and icy objects. These include the Kuiper belt, a group which includes the dwarf planet Pluto and other <b>plutoids</b> including Haumea and Makemake. Further out is the scattered disk, a group which includes Eris, a dwarf planet slightly smaller than Pluto, and even more distant detached objects such as Sedna.|$|R
5|$|The IAU, the internationally {{recognized}} authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies, defines dwarf planets as bodies that are {{large enough to}} have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but have not cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects. Since 2008, there have been five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU. Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The others orbit beyond Neptune and are subclassified as <b>plutoids.</b>|$|R

500|$|When the {{definition}} of [...] "dwarf planet" [...] was instated at the IAU General Assembly of 2006, Ceres, Pluto and Eris were identified by name as the initial members of the dwarf planet class. However, precise regulations as to how hydrostatic equilibrium would be measured were left undefined for the time being. Without an official procedure for calculating the lower bound of size to be a [...] "dwarf planet", no further bodies could be formally recognized as either dwarf planets or <b>plutoids.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulty}} of remotely ascertaining hydrostasis, the IAU only formally confers [...] "dwarf planet" [...] (and by extension, [...] "plutoid") status to those bodies whose minimum estimated size is substantially greater than what is generally thought necessary to guarantee hydrostatic equilibrium. , Pluto, , , and [...] are the only objects officially recognized as <b>plutoids,</b> while upwards of seventy more bodies that currently lack formal recognition are thought likely to meet the definition, and can expect formal recognition at some time in the future.|$|R
500|$|Following the IAU General Assembly, {{the name}} [...] "plutoid" [...] was {{proposed}} {{by the members of}} the IAU Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN), accepted by the Board of Division III, and approved by the IAU Executive Committee at its meeting in Oslo, Norway, on 11 June 2008. [...] The term was announced after the Executive Committee meeting, along with a greatly simplified definition: all trans-Neptunian dwarf planets are <b>plutoids.</b> However, due to a communication error, the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WG-PSN) was not consulted, and they subsequently rejected the term.|$|R
