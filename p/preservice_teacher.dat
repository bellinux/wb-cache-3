40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> justify their solutions for mathematics problems. With this purpose an examination was applied to 40 <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> which were at the first grade of the department of elementary mathematics teacher education. Then 6 <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were randomly selected from these <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> and clinical interviews were conducted with each of them. During the interviews 10 problems were asked to each <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers.</b> According to the data results, it's seen that <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> solve the problems with different ways.

Data was acquired by 1137 <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> studying in various departments of seven different universities in Turkey. Overall, {{it was found that}} <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> have chosen the teaching profession due to easy work conditions. It was found that female <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> chose the teaching profession because of their sympathy towards it, whereas male <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> chose it since their university admission exam scores were just enough for teaching programs. According to the departments of faculties of education, it was determined that psychological counseling and guidance department <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> chose the teaching profession since it ensured employment, Turkish and English teaching department <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> chose it since they liked it, primary school teachers and primary Math <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> chose it because the work conditions were convenient. According to the places they lived in and the departments, there was no hierarchy regarding reasons why they choose the teaching profession. When the reasons of choosing the teaching profession according to level of income were examined the results that the first reason was the same in all three departments.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study focused on}} the development of reflective practice with <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> through a framework during an early field experience. The framework provided an explicit structure for the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to investigate four focus areas (teachers role, active learning, culture, and assessment). The <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> explored a focus area, dialogued via e-mail with a peer, and then discussed their findings in small groups. The <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were given a pre and post survey that queried them about their beliefs related to the four focus areas and the concept of reflection. Content analysis of the explanatory statements on the survey, dialogue e-mails and written reflections after small group discussions, and focus group interviews guided a systematic examination of the data. The dialogue e-mails and written reflections were also analyzed using a rubric for reflective levels. The survey results indicated that while a substantial number of <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> maintained the same belief after experiencing the framework of inquiry into practice, an equal or greater number of <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> changed. These <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> became more student-focused as the semester progressed. They also became increasingly self-critical of their own teaching practices which led them to alternative approaches. Consequently, these <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were able to articulate their beliefs in the context of teaching. The structure of the framework provided opportunities for the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to rehearse reflective practice; thus teacher educators have an explicit methodological model for developing reflective practitioners. Moreover, the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> indicated that the framework increased self-monitoring which facilitated analysis of their teaching...|$|R

We need to understand the nature of growth processes and how to catalyse them.

The research questions addressed <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences during the practicum and how those experiences contributed to their professional growth. Individual face-to-face interviews of 8 <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were the means of data collection.
