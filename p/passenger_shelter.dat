25|$|The Burbank Line was {{completed}} through to Cypress Avenue in Burbank, and by mid-1925 this line was extended {{about a mile}} further along Glenoaks Boulevard to Eton Drive. A small wooden station was erected in Burbank in 1911 at Orange Grove Avenue with a small storage yard in its rear. This depot was destroyed by fire in 1942 and in 1947 a small <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter</b> was constructed.|$|E
25|$|NJ Transit {{provides}} rail service via the Pascack Valley Line's Teterboro - Williams Avenue station, {{which is}} located on the eastern boundary with Teterboro, just across the tracks from the Williams Avenue dead end in Hasbrouck Heights. Although the rail line's tracks lie entirely within the borders of Hasbrouck Heights, and in fact form the borough's eastern boundary with Teterboro, New Jersey Transit considers the station to be in Teterboro because passenger boarding, <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter,</b> parking lot, and ingress/egress roads are accessed from that municipality.|$|E
50|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters</b> at Mana station were {{replaced}} with new shelters {{in the year}} ending June 2015.|$|R

There is also a passenger cover on the single island platform between the two tracks and an additional cover for waiting bus passengers. Hillsboro Central has bike lockers and is handicapped-accessible, but does not have a park-and-ride lot. The station is a hub for bus services in Hillsboro and connections to Cornelius and Forest Grove to the west. This station is served by the following bus lines: [...] 46-North Hillsboro, 47-Baseline/Evergreen, 48-Cornell, and 57-TV Hwy/Forest Grove.|$|E
2500|$|The {{public art}} at the station relates to the hospital, with themes of hope, light, and healing. Individual pieces at the station {{includes}} 300 bronze swallows, considered a symbol of hope. Implanted into the concrete, the swallows are accented by a quote from Shakespeare, while swallows also adorn the weather vanes that sit atop the <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter.</b> Other artwork at the Tuality station includes a picture of Minnie Jones Coy (the founder of the hospital) and the [...] "Quilt of Traditional Remedies" [...] by Jane Kies. [...] Recipes for old medicinal remedies are etched into the glass windscreen in the <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter,</b> while traditional medicine plants grow around the station.|$|E
2500|$|Although both {{nature and}} human {{development}} have taken their toll on {{what remains of the}} railway, some remnants survive. Some of the formation has been destroyed by farming, but much of it can still be traced. Both goods shed and <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter</b> still stand at Kingston Crossing, while at the site of Waimea station two points levers are positioned by the old loading bank. [...] Another loading bank exists at St Patricks, complete with a mounted nameboard. In Balfour, the sealed station platform is now a part of a children's playground, and in the former junction town of Lumsden, the station building is used as a tourist centre. The other junction station in Gore is still busy as a stop on the Main South Line between Dunedin and Invercargill, although its passenger service ceased in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{the station}} was {{refurbished}} at platform level, providing new signage, <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters,</b> security equipment and public address system.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many Transit Centers, Glenn Heights Park & Ride {{does not}} have a heating/cooling {{facility}} nor does it have a station attendant, however it does have four <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The station {{buildings}} at the [...] "New Station" [...] (...) were sold, {{and the current}} station uses {{the east end of}} the down platform and is equipped with basic <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{station was}} opened on 11 December 1905 to {{coincide}} with the introduction of a motor train service by the Great Northern Railway. It was the second station opened on the East Lincolnshire Line to serve the village of Holton-le-Clay in Lincolnshire. Holton-le-Clay and Tetney had opened in 1848 but was over a mile to the south of the village and more convenient for Tetney to the east, whilst Holton Village Halt was in the village itself. The station had two low parallel railmotor platforms to the south of a level crossing over Tetney Lane, with a timber waiting shelter and lamp on each platform. A stationhouse was situated {{on the north side of}} the crossing. It was of more substantial construction than the other halts on the line, such as [...] which was unlit and had only one <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{brick and}} stone shelter {{leading to the}} entrance of the 72nd Street subway station, one of the first 28 subway stations in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, {{on the south side of}} West 72nd Street. [...] For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. [...] In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter</b> on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. [...] While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. [...] Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{remnants}} of closed railway lines deteriorate and disappear over time, {{a number of}} relics from the Roxburgh Branch still exist. [...] The line's formation can often be sighted winding through the countryside and the Manuka tunnel is still in place {{and is now a}} Department of Conservation public walkway of the SH8 road at the western approach to the Manuka Gorge. Round Hill tunnel, which passes directly under the SH8 road at Round Hill, is still in place but the approaches to it are heavily overgrown from both sides. The Big Hill tunnel remains also but is more easily visible from the western portal as the eastern portal is partially obscured by a landslip that fell down from below the SH8 road. In a paddock near a road, Waitahuna retains its goods shed, station building, and even an open-roofed men's toilet. [...] Unfortunately, some other station buildings have not been so lucky; Forsyth's <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter</b> collapsed in 1990, while Lawrence's station was burnt to the ground in a 1981 fire brigade practise. [...] In Rigney, an old boxcar remains {{at the site of the}} former yard, with another boxcar located a couple of kilometres from Teviot, while just out of Beaumont, the original rail bridge over the Beaumont River has been in public use since the year 2000 (Previous to this it had been a private bridge with limited access).|$|E
50|$|Port Adelaide stationâ€™s two {{elevated}} platforms {{are on a}} viaduct {{that carries}} the railway across Commercial Road. The station is unstaffed and has no buildings or other facilities except basic <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters</b> on each platform.|$|R

50|$|Following {{complaints}} made by locals {{about the}} state of the <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter,</b> it was decided in 1904 to upgrade it by adding a floor and window. A small lockable shed was also installed for the storage of small lots, which had previously been left in the <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Milepost 40: South Albion -Small {{flag stop}} <b>passenger</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} closed for about four months, from 8 February to 3 May 2010, and revovated at a cost in excess of $1 million. New <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters</b> were constructed, and both {{platforms}} were demolished and completely rebuilt as higher, 170 metre long, platforms.|$|R

Today, the only station structures in use are two <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters</b> on the platforms and a footbridge.|$|R

5000|$|Belvedere {{railway station}} is a railway station in South East London between Abbey Wood and Erith. It {{is served by}} Southeastern. A level {{crossing}} beyond the platforms' western limits was closed prior to the westerly extension of platforms [...] and the ticket office and <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters</b> were rebuilt soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Fox River Grove {{underwent}} a complete rebuild, that extended platforms to 640 ft, (enough for an 8-car train), 2 new <b>passenger</b> <b>shelters,</b> bathroom facilities, repaved {{parking lot and}} improved lighting.
