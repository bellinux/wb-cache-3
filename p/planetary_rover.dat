40|$|Abstract — <b>Planetary</b> <b>rovers</b> play a {{significant}} role in surface explorations on the Moon and/or Mars. However, because of wheel slippage, the wheels of <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers</b> can get stuck in loose soil, and the exploration mission may fail because of this situation. To avoid slippage and increase the wheels’ drawbar pull, the wheels of <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers</b> typically have parallel fins called lugs on their surface. In this study, we conducted experiments using two-wheeled testbeds in a sandbox to provide a quantitative confirmation of the influence of lugs on the traversability of <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers.</b> In this paper, we report the results of the experiments, and discuss the influence of lugs on the traversability of <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|A rover (or {{sometimes}} <b>planetary</b> <b>rover)</b> is a {{space exploration}} vehicle designed to {{move across the}} surface of a planet or other celestial body. Some rovers have been designed to transport members of a human spaceflight crew; others have been partially or fully autonomous robots. Rovers usually arrive at the planetary surface on a lander-style spacecraft. Rovers are created to land on another planet, besides Earth, to find out information and to take samples. They can collect dust, rocks, and even take pictures.|$|E

After reporting this to the World Space Station, they investigate the formation and hear a strange sound on their communications system, which they assume to be interference from their <b>planetary</b> <b>rover.</b> When they scan the formation with radar, a large vortex kills everyone except Luke.

50|$|A {{telemanipulator}} (or teleoperator) is {{a device}} that is controlled remotely by a human operator. If such a device {{has the ability to}} perform autonomous work, it is called a telerobot. If the device is completely autonomous, it is called a robot. In simple cases the controlling operator's command actions correspond directly to actions in the device controlled, as for example in a radio controlled model aircraft or a tethered deep submergence vehicle. Where communications delays make direct control impractical (such as a remote <b>planetary</b> <b>rover),</b> or it is desired to reduce operator workload (as in a remotely controlled spy or attack aircraft), the device will not be controlled directly, instead being commanded to follow a specified path. At increasing levels of sophistication the device may operate somewhat independently in matters such as obstacle avoidance, also commonly employed in planetary rovers.|$|E

40|$|A <b>planetary</b> <b>rover,</b> like a spacecraft, must {{be fully}} self-contained. Once launched, a rover can only receive {{information}} from its designers, and if solar powered, {{power from the}} sun. As the distance from Earth increases, and the demands for power on the rover increase, {{there is a serious}} tradeofi between communication and computation. Both of these subsystems are very power hungry, and both can be the major driver of the rover’s power subsystem, and therefore the minimum mass and size of the rover.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} algorithms to fuse relative {{and absolute}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) navigation sensors, suitable for micro <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers,</b> {{to provide a}} more accurate estimation of navigation information, specifically, attitude and position. <b>Planetary</b> <b>rovers</b> have extremely slow speed (~ 1 cm/s) and lack conventional navigation sensors/systems, hence the general methods of terrestrial navigation may not be applicable to these applications. While relative attitude and position can be tracked in a way similar to those for ground robots, absolute navigation information is hard to achieve on a remote celestial body, like Moon or Mars, in contrast to terrestrial applications. In this study, two absolute attitude estimation algorithms were developed and compared for accuracy and robustness. The estimated absolute attitude was fused with the relative attitude sensors in a framework of nonlinear filters. The nonlinear Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) were compared in pursuit of better accuracy and reliability in this nonlinear estimation problem, using only on-board low cost MEMS sensors. Experimental results confirmed the viability of the proposed algorithms and the sensor suite, for low cost and low weight micro <b>planetary</b> <b>rovers.</b> It is demonstrated that integrating the relative and absolute navigation MEMS sensors reduces the navigation errors to the desired level...|$|R

Furthermore, they need to perform the optimal estimation of its position {{in order to have}} a good performance on its navigation system. The need for good performance filters for estimating the actual position of mobile robots of this kind is needed, due to the fact that sensors are noisy and that information is of vital importance for a <b>planetary</b> <b>rover’s</b> mission. Besides, good accurate sensors for the matter, are not easy to find for space application. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) were implemented to analyze a data set of a 4 -wheel robot, and later used for comparison on accuracy in the estimation of its pose.
