5|$|From 1986 to 1994, Romney {{presided over}} the Boston Stake, which {{included}} {{more than a dozen}} wards in eastern Massachusetts and almost 4,000church members. He organized a team to handle financial and management issues, sought to counter anti-Mormon sentiments, and tried to solve social <b>problems</b> <b>among</b> poor Southeast Asian converts. An unpaid position, his local church leadership often took 30 or more hours a week of his time, and he became known for his considerable energy in the role. He also earned a reputation for avoiding any overnight travel that might interfere with his church responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Chen {{returned}} from his studies in Nanjing to his village of Dongshigu {{in an effort to}} confront environmental pollution. A paper mill constructed in 1988 had been dumping toxic wastewater into the Meng river, destroying crops and harming wildlife. The chemicals also reportedly caused skin and digestive <b>problems</b> <b>among</b> villagers living downstream from the mill. Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill. The effort was successful, and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill. In addition, Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing, informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals. The British government responded by providing £15,000 towards a deep water well, irrigation systems and water pipelines.|$|E

These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete <b>problems,</b> <b>among</b> the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete).

It had a 500lb (227kg) heavier structure to allow 7.33-g maneuvers as well as a revised fuel system to increase the maximum flight time in afterburner. Like the F-101A it was also fitted with an underfuselage pylon for carrying atomic weapons, as well as two hardpoints for 450-gallon drop tanks. A total of 47 were produced.|$|E
