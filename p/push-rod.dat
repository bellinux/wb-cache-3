25|$|The new Albatros fighters of late 1916 were {{fitted with}} twin guns {{synchronized}} with the Albatros-Hedtke Steuerung gear, {{which was designed}} by Albatros Werkmeister Hedtke. The system was specifically intended to overcome the problems that had arisen in applying the Fokker Stangensteuerung gear to in-line engines and twin gun installations, and was {{a variation of the}} rigid <b>push-rod</b> system, driven {{from the rear of the}} crankshaft of the Mercedes D.III engine.|$|E
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all regimes are well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are <b>push-rod</b> actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a reinforced plastic skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{central shaft}} was rotated by {{synchronous}} motor, driving an eccentric with a throw of about 2mm. (0.077 inch) <b>Push-rods</b> from this operated the contacts. The timing was critical, and was adjusted by rotating {{the position of}} the eccentric on its shaft, and by sliding wedges between the eccentric and <b>push-rods.</b>|$|R

50|$|Using these <b>push-rods</b> in {{combination}} with electroreceptors, also on the bill, allows the platypus to find prey with its eyes closed. While researchers initially believed that the <b>push-rods</b> could only function when something is {{in contact with the}} bill (implicating their use for a tactile sense), it is now believed that they can also be used at a distance to detect hydrodynamic stimuli. The information from <b>push-rods</b> and electroreceptors combine in the somatosensory cortex in a structure with stripes similar to the ocular dominance columns for vision. In the third layer of this structure, sensory inputs from <b>push-rods</b> and electroreceptors may combine so that the platypus can use the time difference between arrival of each type of signal at the bill (with hydrodynamic stimuli arriving after electrical signals) to determine the location of prey. That is, different cortical neurons could encode the delay between detection of electrical and hydrodynamic stimuli. However, a specific neural mechanism for this is not yet known.|$|R
25|$|Räikkönen and Heidfeld took {{seventh and}} ninth {{positions}} respectively for Sauber; Räikkönen {{was satisfied with}} his starting position as he made small changes to the handling balance of his C20 chassis, whilst Heidfeld was held up by Ralf Schumacher and both McLarens who were driving slowly in the final section of the track, causing Heidfeld to go up across an inside kerb and onto grass which lost him three-tenths of a second. The two Saubers were sandwiched by Montoya in the faster Williams who bent a <b>push-rod</b> on his first run after clipping the kerb at the exit of Becketts corner and took over the spare car set up for Ralf Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten qualifiers and said he felt unlucky as his fastest lap was set on his second run and was held up by traffic when track conditions had improved. Panis recorded the eleventh fastest lap time and reported the balance of his car was good but {{had a problem with}} his traction control system which was quickly rectified by his engineers. Villeneuve had an engine problem on his first run and went into the spare BAR monocoque until his race car was fixed and was twelfth fastest. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Jaguars and did not report any problems. Alesi found the old version of his Prost's undertray gave him more consistent handling and recorded the 14th fastest lap. Irvine qualified in 15th position and had a suspension failure and switched to the spare Jaguar which was set-up for de la Rosa. Burti had a large amount of understeer which restricted him to 16th on the grid. Verstappen gradually improved his car throughout the session and secured 17th place; his team-mate Bernoldi took the 20th position and had a throttle issue on his first run which affected his momentum and was held up by Verstappen on his final run. The two Arrows were separated by the Benetton's of Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella; Button was unable to record a faster lap time because he was held up by traffic and Fisichella complained of understeer and poor grip. Alonso secured 21st and completed the grid. His team-mate Tarso Marques failed to set a lap within 107% of Michael Schumacher's pole time and was not allowed to start the race after an appeal by Minardi was rejected by the stewards.|$|E

The A410 used a 6-speed sequential gearbox, driving the rear wheels, and featured carbon fibre disc brakes, as was standard within the class.|$|E
2500|$|The Cody Floatplane was a three-bay biplane of {{orthodox}} design for an aircraft of its time, {{with a single}} elevator operated by a bamboo <b>push-rod</b> mounted on booms {{in front of the}} wing and a single rudder and small horizontal stabiliser on booms behind it. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping. Power was provided by a [...] Green engine mounted on the wing centre section driving a [...] diameter Garuda propeller via a chain. Pilot and passenger were seated in tandem in front of the wing, using Cody's preferred metal seats, of the type used on agricultural machinery. The arrangement of the controls was unconventional by present-day standards: all the control surfaces were operated by a control column and wheel, and the throttle and engine ignition were controlled using foot pedals. It was fitted with one large central float with no fewer than three steps and a pair of smaller stabilising floats positioned below the inboard interplane struts.|$|E

2500|$|It was an {{extremely}} advanced design for the period, with a single-unit steel [...] "bathtub" [...] running from just behind the propeller to the rear crew position acting not only as armour, but also as both the main fuselage structure and engine mounting in one unit.

The flight control surfaces were connected to the aircraft's controls by <b>push-rods</b> and bellcranks – not with the usual steel cable control connections of the era as <b>push-rods</b> were less likely to be severed by ground fire.|$|R
2500|$|Whatever its {{ultimate}} source, the initial {{version of the}} Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider's patent, as claimed by many (including Schneider himself) but Saulnier's. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker's gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and (like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC) it followed Saulnier in taking its primary mechanical drive from the oil pump of a rotary engine. [...] The [...] "transmission" [...] between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier's reciprocating <b>push-rod.</b> The main difference was that instead of the push rod passing directly from the engine to the gun, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam {{at the top of}} the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump's mechanical drive spindle was insufficiently robust to take the extra load.|$|E
2500|$|The Isle of Man Examiner {{newspaper}} described Stanley Woods as an [...] "enthusiastic amateur" [...] {{and started}} the 1922 Junior TT with the number 40 entered by Cotton. After being delayed at the start to stop to recover dropped spark-plugs which had fallen-out of his pocket, Stanley Woods still managed to make good-time and lapped in 40minutes and 50 seconds despite clipping the kerb at Governor's Bridge on lap 1. At Sulby on lap 2, Stanley Woods slipped off the motor-cycle and continued but hit the same kerb again at Governor's Bridge which removed part of the exhaust. A fire in the pits at the TT Grandstand followed which was extinguished by pit-attendants and Stanley Woods using an overcoat. Further problems occurred at Braddan Bridge when Stanley Woods had to stop to re-place an exhaust valve after the inlet <b>push-rod</b> had broken. At Greeba Castle when he discovered the brakes had failed after the rear brake cam lever had split {{a result of the}} pit-fire. Although, Stanley Woods continued the 1922 Junior TT Race with no brakes, he again fell-off at the Ramsey Hairpin on the last-lap, but finished the race in 5th place in a time of 3hours, 55minutes and 33 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanic}} installs {{the solid}} lifter and rotates the engine crank until the cam {{is on the}} [...] "base circle" [...] (not on any intake or exhaust cam lobe). An adjustable-length <b>push-rod</b> checking tool is then installed on the valve location being checked. The pushrod length checking tool is extended until there is no slop (zero lash). Then, the checking tool is removed and measured. The mechanic then adds [...]030-.090" [...] of additional length, depending on the specifications of the lifter being installed. [...] A more typical pre-load range used and recommended by most mechanics is {{in the neighborhood of}} [...]030-.060" [...] The length of the adjustable length <b>push-rod</b> plus the desired pre-load chosen then becomes the desired <b>push-rod</b> length that should be installed, which will keep the hydraulic lifter in the middle of its total piston-travel range.

Front suspension is by wide-based wishbones, working <b>push-rods</b> to spring damper units mounted horizontally across {{the centre of}} the car. TWR racing practice is also followed at the rear, with vertical coil-springs mounted in units with uprights within the rear wheels, allowing for the maximum possible venturi tunnels.

50|$|Introduced in November 1955 and {{launched}} {{at the same}} time as the 349 cc Velocette Viper, the single-cylinder Venom was developed from the Velocette MSS and needed to compete against a new range of British twin-cylinder motorcycles. Conceived by Velocette’s Eugene Goodman and designed by Charles Udall, the Venom's 499 cc engine had a bi-metal cylinder with a cast-iron liner, high compression piston and a light alloy cylinder head. The design of the engine's high cam with short <b>push-rods</b> was simpler to produce than an overhead camshaft engine.|$|R

50|$|The Harley-Davidson Twin Cam {{engines are}} {{motorcycle}} engines made by Harley-Davidson since 1998. Although these engines differed {{significantly from the}} Evolution engine, which in turn {{was derived from the}} series of single camshaft, overhead valve motors that were first released in 1936, they share a number of characteristics with nearly all previous Harley-Davidson engines. Both engines have two cylinders in a V-twin configuration at 45°, are air-cooled (some touring models use liquid cooling for the heads), and activate valves with <b>push-rods.</b> The crankshafts have a single pin with a knife and fork arrangement for the connecting rods.

5000|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} has replaced mechanical {{power transmission}} {{in all but the}} very shortest distances. From the 16th century through the industrial revolution {{to the end of the}} 19th century {{mechanical power transmission}} was the norm. The oldest long-distance power transmission technology involved systems of <b>push-rods</b> (stängenkunst or feldstängen) connecting waterwheels to distant mine-drainage and brine-well pumps. A surviving example from 1780 exists at Bad Kösen that transmits power approximately 200 meters from a waterwheel to a salt well, and from there, an additional 150 meters to a brine evaporator. [...] This technology survived into the 21st century in a handful of oilfields in the US, transmitting power from a central pumping engine to the numerous pump-jacks in the oil field.|$|R
