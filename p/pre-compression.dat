30|$|In {{the first}} state, bars are given <b>pre-compressions</b> {{calculated}} from the changing lengths while being transformed from the initial state, F 1  = EA(L 1  − L 0)/L 0. It can be predicted that, after releasing the bar forces, the network form will expand along the surface to cover more surface than a half-dome in the end; thus, the “over-design” part will be cut off properly to fit the target network.|$|R
30|$|Initial {{forces or}} impact pulse applied on bars will {{obviously}} affect the final state {{at end of}} time duration and the speed of dynamic evolution process. The induced higher accelerations on nodes will cause the nodes to oscillate at higher amplitudes. Therefore, the intermediate state will be missed in the time history records. In the present example, the initial bar forces (<b>pre-compressions)</b> are obtained from a spherical geodesic dome (as original bar lengths). If this radium of the geodesic dome is chosen with a large difference between the target ellipsoid semi-principal axes, then the initial bar forces and the forces calculated during dynamic relaxation will be higher and induce time states with lower resolution. Thus, the initial geometry is suggested to be as closer to the target as possible.|$|R
30|$|In the form-finding procedure, the <b>pre-compressions</b> in {{bars are}} the only {{loadings}} considered on the network structure. Regarding the nodal forces induced by releasing the pre-compressed bars, their components in the directions of surface normal at the nodes should be balanced with the reaction forces from the surface constraining boundary conditions. The residual forces of the nodal forces and the reaction forces, therefore, are {{the components of the}} nodal forces in the tangent plane of the surface at nodes and can be calculated according to the nodal forces and the positions of the nodes. In this manner, for any state of the network, the boundary conditions are considered in the calculation of the residual forces without recognizing the degrees of freedom that are fixed or not fixed. Moreover, the operations on vectors and matrices are unified for different geometries.|$|R

Milling chips from an aluminium alloy were cold compressed {{in a closed}} cylindrical die {{by means of a}} 2, 5 MN hydraulic press. Due to low initial relative density of the chips, several <b>pre-compressions</b> were needed. In order to establish the infl uence of chip geometry on the final density of billets different types of chips were cut by using various milling regimes. The infl uence of a compression regime due to various chip types were followed by load–stroke diagrams. Up to 97 % of density measured at extruded aluminium was attained for one type of chips.

40|$|Many control schemes, simple or sophisticated, utilize high {{performance}} electro-hydraulic components as an interface to mechanical hardware. Failure of an electro-hydraulic component in these applications may impact safety, maintenance schedules and/or {{productivity of the}} overall operation. A condition monitoring scheme that would measure the performance or health of critical electro-hydraulic components would be desirable in addressing the above mentioned concerns. A neural network approach in estimating on-line proportional solenoid valve parameters {{is the focus of}} this study. A neural network algorithm is well suited for this type of parameter estimation in that it is capable of learning and best fitting a solution to given data. It is also capable of handling inherent noise in sensor data and is simple enough to allow for non-complex processing. Some of the parameters that affect the performance of the main stage valve spool which may be used in a condition monitoring scheme include orifice area gradient, spring rates, spring <b>pre-compressions</b> and spool friction. This thesis considers the use of individual neuron structures to estimate each valve parameter. Each neuron trains to a specific valve parameter with its output being the estimated parameter's main spool force contribution. The individual neurons act and train independently; however, their outputs are integrated to compute the main spool differential pressure. This differential pressure calculation is compared to the measured value and the difference is used to train each neural structure. The neural algorithm was found to be quite capable of estimating simulated valve parameters. When applied to experimental data, the neural algorithm estimated comparable main spool valve parameters to results from other studies conducted at the University of Saskatchewan. In all, it was determined that the neural algorithm was capable of estimating accurate and repeatable valve parameters, which reveals the feasibility of the parameter estimation procedure...|$|R

This quantity is important in geotechnical engineering, particularly for finding the expected settlement of foundations and embankments.

5000|$|Heavily loaded {{concrete}} ground-slabs and pavements can {{be sensitive}} to cracking and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete is regularly used in such structures as its <b>pre-compression</b> provides the concrete {{with the ability to}} resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses generated by in-service loading. This crack-resistance also allows individual slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs and less long-term joint maintenance issues. [...] Initial works have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction has been noted as being beneficial for this technique.|$|E
50|$|Whatever {{process is}} {{used to make the}} {{tableting}} blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into the die from above. The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch. After die filling, the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, <b>pre-compression</b> or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500-50 ms per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled {{up and out of the}} die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die. This process is repeated for each tablet.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} eighties, Rosakis {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "laboratory earthquakes" [...] and since then his research interests have mainly focused on the mechanics of seismology, the physics of dynamic shear rupture and frictional sliding and on laboratory seismology. The goal of this body of work is to create, in a controlled and repeatable environment, surrogate laboratory earthquake scenarios mimicking various dynamic shear rupture process occurring in natural earthquake events. Such, highly instrumented, experiments are used to observe new physical phenomena and to also create benchmark comparisons with existing analysis and field observations. The experiments use high-speed photography, full-field photoelasticity, and laser velocimetry as diagnostics. The fault systems are simulated using two photoelastic plates held together in frictional contact. The far field tectonic loading is simulated by <b>pre-compression</b> while the triggering of dynamic rupture (spontaneous nucleation) is achieved by suddenly dropping the normal stress in a small region along the interface. The frictional interface (fault) forms various angles with the compression axis to provide the shear driving force necessary for continued rupturing. Rosakis and his co-workers, investigate the characteristics of rupture, such as rupture speed, rupture mode, associated ground motion under various conditions such as tectonic load, interface complexity and roughness. Both homogeneous and bimaterial interfaces (abutted by various elastic and damaged media) are investigated. Rosakis and his coworkers have been credited with the experimental discovery of the [...] "intersonic" [...] or [...] "supershear rupture" [...] phenomenon. They also have investigated this new phenomenon in various engineering and geophysical settings involving shear dominated rupture {{in the presence of}} weak interfaces or faults. Their experimental discoveries of supershear rupture has refocused the attention of the geophysics community to the study of supershear earthquakes.|$|E

An extensive experimental program {{was carried out}} to study the in-plane lateral performance of un-reinforced masonry, strengthened and retrofitted masonry wall panels under lateral cyclic loading. Twenty tests were carried out; four tests under monotonic lateral loading, twelve tests under static cyclic loading and four tests under pure compression. The test results were analyzed in five groups and this paper presents the analysis of group 4, which deals with effect of axial <b>pre-compression</b> on masonry seismic performance. Three single leaf panels with aspect ratio of 0. 67 having size 1. 65 x 1. 1 m were constructed using same material and workmanship. All the three un-reinforced walls were tested under 0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 MPa vertical <b>pre-compression</b> and displacement controlled static cyclic loading. The wall tested under 0. 5 MPa <b>pre-compression</b> was reference specimen. The key parameters studied were hysterics behavior, peak lateral load, ultimate lateral displacement, energy dissipation, ductility, response factor and damping ratio. It was observed that level of axial <b>pre-compression</b> has significant effect on lateral capacity, failure mode and performance of masonry. In case of zero <b>pre-compression</b> the lateral capacity was very less and wall went into rocking failure at early stages of loading. Increase in <b>pre-compression</b> to 1. 0 MPa enhanced the lateral capacity {{by a factor of}} 1. 92 times.

The bearing strata may also be mechanically pre-compressed. The non-hardening <b>pre-compression</b> fluids may be exchanged with grout to fill a void formed by cavity expansion and previously occupied by the non-hardening, <b>pre-compression</b> fluid.

40|$|During the drill-and-blast {{progress}} in rock tunnel excavation of great deep mine, rock fracture is evaluated by both blasting load and pre-exiting earth stress (<b>pre-compression).</b> Many pre-existing {{flaws in the}} rock mass, like micro-crack, also seriously affect the rock fracture pattern.

Four programs with different static loading modes that generate different <b>pre-compression</b> fields were executed, and the length, velocity of the blasting wing crack and dynamic stress intensity factor (SIF) at the wing crack tip were analyzed and discussed. It is found that the behaviour of blasting-induced wing crack is affected obviously by blasting and <b>pre-compression.</b> And <b>pre-compression,</b> which is vertical to {{the direction of the}} wing crack propagation, hinders the crack propagation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the effect on strength and ductility of retrofitting unreinforced masonry (URM) shear panels with near surface mounted (NSM) carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips. A total of sixteen wall panels, 1200 mm × 1200 mm, were subjected to vertical <b>pre-compression</b> combined with increasing reversing cycles of in-plane lateral displacement. All wall panels were previously tested (prior to retrofitting) under compression and cyclic shear using three different <b>pre-compression</b> levels resulting in various levels of damage. The damaged walls were repaired, retrofitted with NSM FRP strips and retested under <b>pre-compression</b> stress levels of 2. 8 MPa, 2 MPa and 1. 4 MPa. The retrofitted walls displayed higher displacement capacities compared with URM walls highlighting the effectiveness of retrofitting URM walls under earthquake loading. The ultimate loads were not enhanced due to retrofitting under higher <b>pre-compression</b> levels. However the presence of the reinforcement did restore the ultimate loads to those observed for the original undamaged URM state. This meant that overall, the reinforcement was effective in increasing the energy dissipation capacity of the walls compared to URM. The improvements in the behaviour of the URM walls due to retrofitting were generally similar, irrespective of the amount of damage the URM walls experienced prior to retrofitting. The paper discusses the effect on strength, displacement capacity, energy dissipation and ductility achieved by FRP retrofitting of the damaged (lightly and highly) URM panels compared to the undamaged URM panels under different <b>pre-compression</b> levels. The broader aim of the research is to identify techniques for improving the seismic performance of existing URM walls under in-plane shear loading...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the CFD simulation {{study on the}} effect of volume ratio on pressure piling. The explosion of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as “pressure piling” and its occurrence is a relevant issue of industrial safety. Pressure piling is a situation where peak pressures much higher than the expected values predicted by thermodynamic are generated in the geometry. The geometric characteristics of the vessels such as the tube area and ratio of volumes of the interconnected vessels play important role in the intensity of the pressure piling. Moreover, <b>pre-compression</b> and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling. A CFD-Ansys and RANS model were used in this paper. The models duplicated experimental explosion behaviours and the results were compared with experimental. Propane-air mixture was used to study pressure piling. In the end it was found that <b>pre-compression</b> and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling, which in turns affect the ratio between reaction and venting time in the second vessel (Brt). Higher the Brt number in the second vessel, lower the occurrence of pressure piling. Lower the volume ratio, higher the violence of explosion. Increasing the volume ratio results in a more intense <b>pre-compression</b> (pressure in the secondary vessel at ignition time increases) thus suggesting that ignition in the second vessel occurs starting from a higher value of pressure. Therefore, low <b>pre-compression</b> and high Brt number can prevent the occurrence of pressure pilin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental tests for six clay brick masonry walls vertically reinforced with near-surface-mounted CFRP strips. The total amount of FRP used in each test was constant, only the type of loading (i. e. static versus cyclic) and vertical <b>pre-compression</b> (i. e. 0. 0 MPa, 0. 1 MPa and 0. 2 MPa) was varied. The results of these tests indicate that cyclic loading degrades the mechanical interlock between the NSM reinforcement giving a slight reduction in strength once debonding commences.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} assessment {{of the influence of}} parameters such as <b>pre-compression</b> level, aspect ratio, vertical and horizontal reinforcement ratios and boundary conditions on the lateral strength of masonry walls under in-plane loading. The numerical study is performed through the software DIANA (R) based on the Finite Element Method. The validation of the numerical model is carried out from a database of available experimental results on masonry walls tested under cyclic lateral loading. Numerical results revealed that boundary conditions play a central role on the lateral behavior of masonry walls under in-plane loading and determine the influence of level of <b>pre-compression</b> as well as the reinforcement ratio on the wall strength. The lateral capacity of walls decreases with the increase of aspect ratio and with the decrease of <b>pre-compression.</b> Vertical steel bars appear to have almost no influence in the shear strength of masonry walls and horizontal reinforcement only increases the lateral strength of masonry walls if the shear response of the walls is determinant for failure, which {{is directly related to the}} boundary conditions.
