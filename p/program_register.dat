[...] Words on the drums were organized in bands around the drum, fifty words per band, and 20, 40, or 80 bands for the respective models. A word could be accessed when its {{location on the}} drum surface passed under the read/write heads during rotation (rotating at 12,500 rpm, the non-optimized average access time was 2.5 ms).

40|$|We {{discuss the}} problem of {{designing}} unambiguous programmable discriminators for any $n$ unknown quantum states in an $m$-dimensional Hilbert space. The discriminator is a fixed measurement which has two kinds of input registers: the <b>program</b> <b>registers</b> and the data <b>register.</b> The <b>program</b> <b>registers</b> consist of the $n$ states, while the data register is prepared among them. The task of the discriminator is to tell us which state stored in the <b>program</b> <b>registers</b> is equivalent {{to that in the}} data register. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for judging an unambiguous programmable discriminator. Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal unambiguous programmable discriminator for them, in the sense of maximizing the worst-case probability of success. Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous programmable discriminator for arbitrary $n$ quantum states. We also show how to use this universal discriminator to unambiguously discriminate mixed states. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

40|$|A {{universal}} programmable discriminator {{can perform}} the discrimination between two unknown states, and the optimal solution can be approached via the discrimination {{between the two}} averages over the uniformly distributed unknown input pure states, which has been widely discussed in previous works. In this paper, we consider the success probabilities of the optimal universal programmable unambiguous discriminators when applied to the pure input states. More precisely, the analytic results of the success probabilities are derived with the expressions of the optimal measurement operators for the universal discriminators and {{we find that the}} success probabilities {{have nothing to do with}} the dimension d while the amounts of the copies in the two <b>program</b> <b>registers</b> are equal. The success probability of programmable unambiguous discriminator can asymptoticly approach to that of usual unambiguous discrimination (state comparison) as the number of copies in <b>program</b> <b>registers</b> (data register) goes to infinity.

40|$|Background: The National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program {{provides}} HPV {{vaccine to}} high school students through school-based vaccination. We aimed to: 1) assess the vaccine completion rates achieved when general practice is used for completing doses missed at school; 2) estimate the extent of under-notification by general practices of vaccine doses administered; and 3) assess the reasons reported by parents of students for non-completion of HPV vaccination. Methods: A postal survey was conducted of parents and carers of students and identified, using school-program records, as incompletely vaccinated in a large regional area of northern NSW vaccinated during 2010. Information about additional HPV vaccine doses received or reasons for non-completion were sought. Responses were analysed and records cross-checked against the National HPV Vaccination <b>Program</b> <b>Register.</b> Results: Of 660 parents or carers contacted, 207 (31. 4 %) responded. We found: 1) completion rates increased, an additional 122 / 207 (45. 2 %) students had completed all three doses of HPV through their general practitioner (GP); 2) under-notification of GP doses to the National HPV Vaccination <b>Program</b> <b>Register</b> was an issue with only 5 / 165 (3. 0 %) reported; 3) {{the main reason for}} non-completion was being unaware of the opportunity to catch-up at a GP. Conclusions: Underreporting by GPs of HPV vaccine doses administered and failure to complete courses identifies two opportunities to increase HPV vaccine coverage. These could be addressed by extending provision of catch-up HPV doses in school and by developing practice software solutions for automatic notification of doses from GPs. Reasons given by parents for non-completion, mostly logistical barriers, indicate a high degree of acceptance of HPV vaccination...|$|E
