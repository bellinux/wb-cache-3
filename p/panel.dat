The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent <b>panel</b> of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This <b>panel</b> consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the <b>panel</b> to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a <b>panel</b> consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The <b>panel</b> released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the <b>panel</b> criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The <b>panel</b> also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the <b>panel</b> faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E

40|$|Graphite-epoxy <b>panels</b> with S glass {{buffer strips}} {{were tested in}} tension and shear to measure their {{residual}} strengths with crack-like damage. The buffer strips were regularly spaced narrow strips of continuous S glass. <b>Panels</b> were made with a uniweave graphite cloth where the S glass buffer material was woven directly into the cloth. <b>Panels</b> were made with different width and thickness buffer strips. The <b>panels</b> were loaded to failure while remote strain, strain {{at the end of}} the slit, and crack opening displacement were monitoring. The notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack growth and damage. Except for <b>panels</b> with short slits, the buffer strips arrested the propagating crack. The strength (or failing strain) of the <b>panels</b> was significantly higher than the strength of all-graphite <b>panels</b> with the same length slit. <b>Panels</b> with wide, thick buffer strips were stronger than <b>panels</b> with thin, narrow buffer strips. A shear-lag model predicted the failing strength of tension <b>panels</b> with wide buffer strips accurately, but over-estimated the strength of the shear <b>panels</b> and the tension <b>panels</b> with narrow buffer strips...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compute the optimal depth increase of the embossed <b>panels</b> of a stainless water tank used for an energy storage system. The pressing used to emboss the <b>panels</b> of the stainless water tank decreases their thickness. By assuming that the <b>panels</b> had the same volume before (V o) and after the change (V c), we found an equation that computed how much the thickness of the <b>panels</b> decreased. According to the obtained thickness equation, the thickness of arch-embossed <b>panels</b> decreased by 50 % relative to flat <b>panels,</b> and that of pyramid-embossed <b>panels</b> decreased by up to 30 %. We also performed finite element method analyses of four flat <b>panels,</b> four arch-embossed <b>panels,</b> and four pyramid-embossed <b>panels</b> by applying the thickness equation for different depth increase. As a result, the optimal depth increase of the arch-embossed <b>panels</b> was 70 – 90 [*]mm, and that of the pyramid-embossed <b>panels</b> was 150 – 200 [*]mm. We concluded that these computed optimal depth increase could be useful in the economic design of a stainless water tank for an energy storage system...|$|R

5|$|The {{investigation}} <b>panel</b> {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The <b>panel</b> had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the <b>panel,</b> although the <b>panel</b> said that the records were not enough. The <b>panel</b> obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of visual assessment grade on the residual flexural capacity of 46 existing precast concrete ribbed <b>panels</b> from different agricultural buildings was studied. Before the tests the <b>panels</b> were assessed on a 6 -point rating scale according to visually distinguishable corrosion deterioration. All <b>panels,</b> the ultimate load {{of which was}} lower than the control load, received grade 0 on the visual rating scale. Consequently, attention should be paid to <b>panels</b> where the concrete cover of longitudinal reinforcement has spalled (grade 0) which could {{be a sign of}} decreasing load capacity. The majority of <b>panels</b> with grade 0 exhibited larger deflections under load than <b>panels</b> with higher grades. Of the 46 <b>panels</b> tested flexural ductile failure was noticed at 36 <b>panels.</b> Key words: visual grade, residual flexural capacity, corrosion, precast ribbed <b>panels...</b>|$|R

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's <b>panel</b> is {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's <b>panel,</b> compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his <b>panel,</b> but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
