25|$|There is {{much debate}} {{on the topic of}} {{euthanasia}} in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States). <b>Passive</b> <b>euthanasia</b> was declared legal by Israel's highest court under certain conditions and has reached some level of acceptance. Active euthanasia remains illegal, however the topic is actively under debate with no clear consensus through legal, ethical, theological and spiritual perspectives.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary, non-voluntary and {{involuntary}} types can {{be further}} divided into passive or active variants. <b>Passive</b> <b>euthanasia</b> entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces, (such as administering a lethal injection), and is the more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate {{whether or not to}} regard the practice as active or passive.|$|E
50|$|Active non-voluntary {{euthanasia}} {{is illegal}} in all {{countries in the}} world, although it is practised in the Netherlands on infants (see below) under an agreement between physicians and district attorneys. <b>Passive</b> non-voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> (withholding life support) is legal in various countries, such as India, Albania, and {{many parts of the}} United States and is practiced in English hospitals.|$|R
25|$|Voluntary {{euthanasia}} {{is conducted}} {{with the consent of}} the patient. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. <b>Passive</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> is legal throughout the US per Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health. When the patient brings about his or her own death with the assistance of a physician, the term assisted suicide is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.|$|R
50|$|Flynn {{has also}} written for Free Inquiry arguing that {{euthanasia}} {{in the form of}} mercy killing is acceptable. In the article, Flynn cast doubt on the usefulness of the doctrine of double effect which is used to justify a distinction between <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia.</b>|$|R
25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and <b>passive</b> <b>euthanasia</b> is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{euthanasia}} {{debate has}} {{tended to focus on}} a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that {{people have a right to}} self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between <b>passive</b> <b>euthanasia,</b> which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the doctrine of double effect–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.|$|E

It also {{refers to the}} right to live, which does not prohibit abortion or <b>passive</b> <b>euthanasia,</b> both of which are legal in Switzerland. Also, Article 10 provides for a [...] "right to personal liberty, particularly to corporal and mental integrity, and to freedom of movement". Personal liberty, according to case law, covers all important aspects of personal development and lifestyle, such as choices in diet, healthcare, personal relations and sexual activity. Article 11, a novel provision in the 1999 constitution, extends particular protection to children and young people.|$|E

40|$|Euthanasia {{is one of}} the {{controversial}} topics in current medical ethics. Among the six well-known types of <b>euthanasia,</b> <b>passive</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> (PVE) seems to be more plausible in comparison with other types, from the moral point of view. According to the Kantian framework, ethical features come from 'reason'. Maxims are formulated as categorical imperative which has three different versions. Moreover, the second version of categorical imperative which is dubbed 'principle of ends' is associated with human dignity. It follows from this that human dignity has an indisputable role in the Kantian story. On the other hand, there are two main theological schools in Islamic tradition which are called: Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite. Moreover, there are two main Islamic branches: Shiite and Sunni. From the theological point of view, Shiite's theoretical framework is similar to the Mu'tazilite one. According to Shiite and Mu'tazilite perspectives, moral goodness and badness can be discovered by reason, on its own. Accordingly, bioethical judgments can be made based on the very concept of human dignity rather than merely resorting to the Holy Scripture or religious jurisprudential deliberations. As far as PVE is concerned, the majority of Shiite scholars do not recognize a person's right to die voluntarily. Similarly, on the basis of Kantian ethical themes, PVE is immoral, categorically speaking. According to Shiite framework, however, PVE could be moral in some ethical contexts. In other words, in such contexts, the way in which Shiite scholars deal with PVE is more similar to Rossian ethics rather than the Kantian one...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{a new model}} to passive smoking for rodents. METHODS: Twenty rats were distributed into two study groups (N= 10) : control group (CG), that was not exposed to tobacco smoke and used as normal standard for biochemical and histological analysis; Experimental Group (EG), that Animals {{were exposed to the}} <b>passive</b> smoking; <b>Euthanasia</b> was performed after 14 days of exposure. The serum level of nicotine and histological analysis were performed. RESULTS: There was a statistical difference on the nicotine serum levels between Experimental and Control group, with level of 286 ± 23 nanograma/mL in the EG and undetectable on CG (p< 0. 01). The histological study suggested the model efficacy producing alveolar destruction and emphysema in the EG compared with the insignificant lesions in the CG's lung. CONCLUSION: The model of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke for rodents induced easily the changes related to secondhand smoke...|$|R

50|$|Like {{the trend}} among Protestants, Jewish medical ethics have become divided, partly on denominational lines, over {{euthanasia}} {{and end of}} life treatment since the 1970s.

Likewise, within the Conservative Judaism movement, there has been increasing support for <b>passive</b> <b>euthanasia</b> (PAD) In Reform Judaism responsa, the preponderance of anti-euthanasia sentiment has shifted {{in recent years to}} increasing support for certain <b>passive</b> <b>euthanasia</b> options.

40|$|Today in most {{countries}} the practising of euthanasia is not permissible and as in any case of a criminal offence, which endangers {{the life of a}} person, criminal liability applies here. However, the analysis of legal norms in foreign criminal codes reveals several deficiencies, ranging from – the absence of legal regulation which leads to a paradoxical situation, when ignoring the motive and aim of the offence, euthanasia is qualified according to the article of the criminal code which provides for liability for murder with no mitigating circumstances, but assisted suicide liability does not apply at all, – to including special legal norms pertaining to this problematic issue, in the structure of criminal codes, in the disposition of which there is an absence of several mandatory constituent elements of these particular criminal offences, thus unduly extending the provision of these norms in practice also in the cases not related to “easy death”. The deficiencies of legal acts are observed also in those few countries which allow a definite form of euthanasia and its practising by means of special laws. And most importantly, foreign legislators ignore such forms of terminating the lives of incurably ill persons as active and <b>passive</b> non-voluntary <b>euthanasia,</b> which depending {{on the nature of the}} offence requires an appropriate legal framework, which so far has not been observed...|$|R
40|$|We {{presented}} {{subjects with}} pairs of hypothetical scenarios. The action in each scenario harmed {{some people in}} order to aid others. In {{one member of the}} pair, the harm was {{a direct result of the}} action. In the other member, it was an indirect byproduct. Subjects preferred the indirect harm to the direct harm. This result could not be fully explained in terms of di#erences in judgments about which option was more active, more intentional, more likely to cause harm, or more subject to the disapproval of others. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a new bias in judgment, a tendency to favor indirectly harmful options over directly harmful alternatives, irrespective of the associated outcomes, intentions, or self-presentational concerns. We speculate that this bias could originate from the use of a typical but somewhat unreliable property of harmful acts, their directness, as a cue to moral evaluation. We discuss the implications of the bias for a range of social issues, including the distinction between <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia,</b> legal deterrence, and the rhetoric of a#rmative action...|$|R
40|$|Euthanasia {{has been}} a part of life in many {{cultures}} and it has been expressed in a multitude of ways. Euthanasia is not just a result of economic distress; it also has a basis in some religious belief systems. However, in the United States, economic survival of an entire group is not dependent upon the death of one or more individuals, and people are not chosen nor do they offer to sacrifice themselves for their survival of their families. Issues surrounding euthanasia include fear of death, fear of dying, fear of living, and fear of emotional and physical pain. The author discusses the differences between <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia,</b> and between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Further examined is the state of the euthanasia movement in the United States, as well as the development of the philosophical bases of the arguments for and against euthanasia. The author presents a history of the euthanasia movement within the last century. Methodology includes examination of a court case and analysis of case studies...|$|R

5000|$|The Japanese {{government}} has no official laws {{on the status of}} euthanasia and the Supreme Court of Japan has never ruled on the matter. Rather, to date, Japan's euthanasia policy has been decided by two local court cases, one in Nagoya in 1962, and another after an incident at Tokai University in 1995. The first case involved [...] "passive euthanasia" [...] (shōkyokuteki anrakushi) (i.e., allowing a patient to die by turning off life support) and the latter case involved [...] "active euthanasia" [...] (sekkyokuteki anrakushi) (e.g., through injection). The judgments in these cases set forth a legal framework and a set of conditions within which both <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia</b> could be legal. Nevertheless, in both of these particular cases the doctors were found guilty of violating these conditions when taking the lives of their patients. Further, because the findings of these courts have yet to be upheld at the national level, these precedents are not necessarily binding. Nevertheless, at present, there is a tentative legal framework for implementing euthanasia in Japan.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the {{portrayal}} of death in modern North American society in the highest circulating English language magazines available in Canada and published either in the United States or in Canada, in 1991, 1996, and 2001. The prevailing underlying frame/discourse of which there were a number of sub-variants, was the notion of the control of death. Stories focused on people taking control of death by 1) <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia,</b> 2) suicide with political and social motivations and messages, 3) suicide deaths among celebrities and the families of celebrities, 4) dramatic murders, 5) issues in the “right to die movement,” and 6) new techniques and technologies for life extension. There was a very small minority of articles on miscellaneous issues such as death rates and their variation across geographic region, social class, environmental condition, and cause. The article ends with discussion of the ways that this portrayal of death obfuscates the real lack of control most North Americans, particularly those who are poor or “racialized,” have over the timing, or circumstances of death. In addition, as a critical discourse analysis, it discusses the interests that are served by this perspective...|$|R
40|$|The thesis titled "Sanctity of life - defence of {{bioethics}} principle" {{focuses on}} current ethical issues concerning the {{human life and}} medicine. The defence of the Sanctity of life doctrine, whose importance is diminishing due to current social changes and technological advances, {{will be based on}} both church and secural arguments. The aim of the thesis is to explain the doctrine and try to prove that it is still valid even beyond the religious field. The focus of the study narrows to the problems of intentional withdrawing treatment causing death, practise of <b>passive</b> and active <b>euthanasia</b> and negative implications connected with such a practise. Further, the principles and opinions of two bioethic doctrines Sanctity of life and Quality of life will be compared for both of which expressions such as dignity, value of human being and quality of life are very important. However, it is necessary to say, that it is the interpretation of these key points and especially the conclusions drawn from them what divides these two principles essentially.

KEY WORDS: tragic moral choices; omission bias; direct vs. indirect harm; Kant. Judgments about decisions often favor options that lead to worse consequences than the alternatives. In the endowment effect, people are unwilling to give up their endowment for what they would otherwise prefer to it (Kahneman et al., 1990). In omission bias, people are unwilling to bring about a preferred outcome through harmful action, when the alternative involves omission that is even more harmful (Ritov and Baron, 1990; Spranca et al., 1991). Many preference reversals show that some means of eliciting choices must lead to nonoptimal outcomes, that is, outcomes that the decision maker herself would find less desirable than the available alternatives (e. g., Hsee et al., 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|Los avances de la {{medicina}} en el área tecnológica respecto de la aplicación de métodos de soporte vital en el paciente crítico y las modificaciones culturales que se han operado en la sociedad contemporánea con relación al derecho de los pacientes a decidir sobre el final de sus vidas, hacen imprescindible disponer de una definición de eutanasia que atienda la vigencia de este nuevo escenario. La exclusión de las llamadas formas pasivas y en general de la omisión como procedimiento o conducta posible para la provocación de la muerte y la necesidad de la voluntariedad explícita del paciente delimitarían muy concretamente el concepto de eutanasia. Del mismo modo, una referencia concreta sobre el modo de provocar la muerte debería integrar obligatoriamente su definición. Así, la eutanasia significaría básicamente provocar la muerte de un paciente portador de una enfermedad mortal, a su requerimiento y en su propio beneficio, {{por medio de}} la administración de un tóxico o veneno en dosis mortal. Esta definición muy restrictiva separaría la eutanasia de los casos de rechazo de tratamiento, aunque se produjera la muerte como resultado del mismo, y también de las situaciones en que la abstención o el retiro de un soporte vital en el paciente crítico permite la llegada de la muerte. Technological {{progress in}} medicine regarding the application of life-sustaining treatment in the critical patient and the cultural changes {{that have taken place}} in contemporary society with respect to the patients' right to decide over the end of their lives, demand the existence of a definition of euthanasia that will acknowledge this new scenario. The concept of euthanasia would be very specifically limited by the exclusion of so-called <b>passive</b> forms of <b>euthanasia</b> and of omission as a possible procedure to cause death and the need for the explicit request of the patient involved. Likewise, the definition of euthanasia should include a specific reference to the means through which death is to be achieved. Euthanasia would thus be defined basically as causing the death of a patient suffering from a mortal disease, upon his or her request and for his or her own benefit, by administering a toxic or poisonous substance in mortal doses. This restrictive definition would differentiate euthanasia from cases of refusal to receive treatment, even if death is the consequence of such refusal, and also from cases in which life-sustaining treatment is withheld or withdrawn to enable the occurrence of death...|$|R
