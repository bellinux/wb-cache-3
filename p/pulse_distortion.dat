We investigated whether brachial artery pressure waves could be reconstructed from finger pressure measurements by correcting for the pressure gradient in addition to correction for <b>pulse</b> wave <b>distortion</b> with a previously described filter. Finger artery pressure (with Finapres), intra-arterial brachial artery pressure (BAP), Riva-Rocci/ Korotkoff (RRK), oscillometric, and return-to-flow (RTF) measurements were simultaneously performed in 57 healthy elderly subjects and patients with vascular disease and/or hypertension. A generalized waveform filter was used to correct for <b>pulse</b> wave <b>distortions.</b> Correction equations for the pressure gradient, based on finger pressure, RRK, RTF, or oscillometric measurements, were obtained in 28 randomly selected subjects and tested in 29.
