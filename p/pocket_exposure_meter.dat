50|$|Canon's sudden {{switch from}} professionally {{oriented}} SLR cameras to advanced amateur cameras happened in March 1964 {{when they left}} the Canon Canonflex range and launched the Canon FX with the FL lens mount. It has a built in CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> with a circular window on the right-hand camera front. The Canon FP without <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> was added later the same year. The cameras were well built, but the metering technology was several years behind the Minolta SR-7 which pioneered that technology in 1962. Then just half a year later, in the spring of 1965 Canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable Pellix. The new camera featured the much-expected TTL <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> facility, albeit employing the stop-down metering method.|$|R

50|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> uses a {{circular}} CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is to {{estimate}} the subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|R

50|$|The Pen EM, {{produced}} from 1965 to 1966, is a motorized Pen model. It has a 35mm f/2 lens, and a CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> allowing automatic or manual exposure.|$|R
50|$|However, by the 1960s the clamour for in-camera <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> was rising. It was {{possible}} to attach an external CdS (Cadmium sulfide) <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> to the later AP-derived models, but in 1960 the next breakthrough arrived. At the 1960 photokina camera show, Asahi exhibited the Spot-matic prototype. This camera took exposure measurements, via a spotmeter, through the taking lens, an incredible innovation. The camera excited tremendous attention and in 1964 the first production Spotmatic (hyphen dropped) emerged. The Spotmatic was virtually identical to the prototype; however, the spotmeter was replaced with an all-over average-reading <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> {{in order to give}} more consistent results. The camera was an instant success and was snapped up by the thousands, although Asahi had been beaten into production by the Topcon RE Super which went on sale in April 1963; the Topcon failed to attract the same degree of commercial success. The Spotmatic was replaced by the Spotmatic II with many upgrades 1971 - 1976.|$|R

50|$|Digital SLRs {{supporting}} {{live view}} or video {{will use the}} read out of the image sensor itself for <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> in these modes. This also applies to Sony's SLT digital cameras, which use the image sensor for <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> all the time.Up {{to the time of}} this writing (2012), no digital SLR or SLT camera on the market supported any form of real-time TTL flash metering using the image sensor. However, it can be expected that such methods will be introduced as image sensor technology progresses, given the advantages of metering with real-time feedback and without preflash.|$|R
5000|$|What was {{the meter}} {{adjustment}} knob {{on the top}} plate is now a fixed housing for the ASA/DIN scale. The selenium cell <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is now coupled to a [...] "setting wheel" [...] located on {{the very bottom of}} the lens mount. This setting wheel sets adjusts the camera's exposure value (EV) by changing (in a most complex fashion) the aperture and/or shutter rings {{at the same time that}} it changes the depth-of-field pointers on the camera's lens. When another button (located on the top plate) is pushed simultaneously, the setting wheel is also used to set the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter's</b> ASA/DIN setting.|$|R
50|$|Though {{it is not}} a single-lens reflex camera, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} for being the first camera having a serially integrated <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> (Gossen), capable of measuring light through its picture-taking lens, connected.|$|R

50|$|APEX made {{exposure}} computation {{a relatively}} simple matter; the foreword of ASA PH2.5-1960 recommended that <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> <b>exposure</b> calculators, and exposure tables be modified to incorporate the logarithmic values that APEX required. In many instances, this was done: the 1973 and 1986 ANSI exposure guides, ANSI PH2.7-1973 and ANSI PH2.7-1986, eliminated exposure calculator dials in favor of tabulated APEX values. However, the logarithmic markings for aperture and shutter speed required to set the computed exposure were never incorporated in consumer cameras. Accordingly, no reference to APEX was made in ANSI PH3.49-1971 (though it {{was included in the}} Appendix). The incorporation of <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> in many cameras in the late 1960s eliminated the need to compute exposure, so APEX saw little actual use.|$|R
