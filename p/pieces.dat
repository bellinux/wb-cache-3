5|$|All <b>pieces</b> {{struck at}} the Philadelphia mint, without mintmark.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{when one}} board finishes, play can {{continue}} on the other board. In this case, <b>pieces</b> in reserve can still be dropped, but no new <b>pieces</b> are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.|$|E
5|$|Austen sent short <b>pieces</b> {{of writing}} to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is {{manuscript}} evidence that Austen {{continued to work}} on these <b>pieces</b> as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposing}} <b>piece</b> {{is captured}} by displacement: That is, if a <b>piece</b> {{moves to a}} square occupied by an opposing <b>piece,</b> the opposing <b>piece</b> is displaced and removed from the board. A <b>piece</b> cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly <b>piece</b> (meaning another <b>piece</b> controlled by the moving player).|$|R
50|$|Capturing the {{checking}} <b>piece,</b> {{with either}} the king or another <b>piece.</b> If the checking <b>piece</b> is on a square next to the king, the king can capture the <b>piece</b> if the king does not move into a new check, i.e. if the <b>piece</b> is not protected by another enemy <b>piece.</b> Note that the <b>piece</b> which is pinned to the king cannot capture the checking <b>piece</b> because such a move will place the king in a check from the pinning <b>piece.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>piece</b> is said {{to attack}} (or threaten) an opponent's <b>piece</b> if, in the next move, it could capture that <b>piece.</b> A <b>piece</b> {{is said to}} defend (or protect) a <b>piece</b> of the defender's color if, in case the defended <b>piece</b> were taken by the opponent, the defender could {{immediately}} recapture. Attacking a <b>piece</b> usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked <b>piece</b> is undefended, or if the attacking <b>piece</b> is of lower value than the one attacked.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) <b>pieces</b> {{were struck}} for {{circulation}}, bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation <b>pieces</b> were initially struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d <b>pieces</b> presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy <b>pieces.</b> The design of the circulation 3d remained {{the same as that of}} the Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy <b>pieces,</b> intended for colonial use, were struck in 1838, 1843, and 1848.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the <b>pieces</b> to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken <b>pieces</b> are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken <b>pieces</b> are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of <b>pieces.</b> A move is completed {{only when the}} clock is pressed. Touch move is practiced to a lesser extent. When used, it applies to <b>pieces</b> in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposing}} <b>piece</b> {{is captured}} by displacement: That is, if a <b>piece</b> {{moves to a}} square occupied by an opposing <b>piece,</b> the opposing <b>piece</b> is displaced and removed from the board. A <b>piece</b> cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly <b>piece,</b> that is, by another <b>piece</b> controlled by the moving player. The one exception to this is the unique burn of the fire demon.|$|R
50|$|A {{player can}} capture an opponent's <b>piece</b> by landing their <b>piece</b> upon it. The {{captured}} <b>piece</b> {{is removed from}} the board and must start again. A <b>piece</b> cannot land on an opponent's <b>piece</b> that is on a resting square.|$|R
5000|$|When {{capturing}} the opponent's <b>piece.</b> The score is obtained by calculating the number value of player's <b>piece</b> which captures the opponent's <b>piece</b> and the captured <b>piece.</b> The mathematical operation used depends where the player's <b>piece</b> lands after the capture.|$|R
5|$|By convention, {{the game}} <b>pieces</b> {{are divided into}} white and black sets, and the players are {{referred}} to as White and Black respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 <b>pieces</b> of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The <b>pieces</b> are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken <b>pieces</b> can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The <b>pieces</b> are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The <b>pieces</b> are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, BBC Music {{created a}} music {{education}} scheme similar to Fantasia called Ten <b>Pieces,</b> intended to introduce children to classical music. Spanning two films (in 2014 and 2015), several <b>pieces</b> {{featured in the}} Fantasia films are also included.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relative}} pin is {{one where}} the <b>piece</b> shielded by the pinned <b>piece</b> is a <b>piece</b> other than the king, but it's typically more valuable than the pinned <b>piece.</b> Moving such a pinned <b>piece</b> is legal but may not be prudent, as the shielded <b>piece</b> would then be vulnerable to capture. (See diagram at right.) ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{represents}} a capture by <b>piece</b> × <b>piece,</b> not <b>piece</b> × square.|$|R
5000|$|In chess, a pin is a {{situation}} brought on by an attacking <b>piece</b> in which a defending <b>piece</b> cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending <b>piece</b> on its other side to capture by the attacking <b>piece.</b> [...] "To pin" [...] refers to {{the action of the}} attacking <b>piece</b> inducing the pin, and the defending <b>piece</b> so restricted is described as pinned.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta {{relocated}} the long lost S. parksi site. <b>Pieces</b> of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, {{were found in the}} quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more <b>pieces</b> will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether S. albertensis and S. parksi are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial Styracosaurus skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed Styracosaurus bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous <b>pieces</b> of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill <b>pieces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jade has {{a unique}} place in Chinese culture. The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the {{imperial}} collection, includes some 30,000 <b>pieces.</b> The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several <b>pieces</b> famed throughout history, as well as artefacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest <b>pieces</b> date from the Neolithic period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty <b>pieces,</b> on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of the}} Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved {{jewels and}} was {{responsible}} for the commissions of particularly lavish <b>pieces</b> of ronde-bosse—a newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold <b>pieces.</b> Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine <b>pieces</b> of tableaux d'or from Parisian goldsmiths.|$|E
5000|$|Knife #1 {{is moved}} {{horizontally}} {{from the left}} of <b>piece</b> X to its right. It divides <b>piece</b> X to two pieces: the left <b>piece</b> XL and the right <b>piece</b> XR.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>piece</b> {{landing on}} a square with an {{opponent}}'s <b>piece</b> not only sends the opponent <b>piece</b> {{back to the}} starting area but also sends the landing <b>piece</b> to its home square.|$|R
5000|$|Meeting: If a <b>piece</b> could capture another <b>piece</b> {{with the}} same value by landing on it, the <b>piece</b> stays in its {{location}} and the opponent's <b>piece</b> is taken from the board.|$|R
5|$|Major <b>pieces</b> {{were created}} at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising their activity. Some of the <b>pieces</b> assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual <b>pieces</b> would take up to two months to complete.|$|E
5|$|Notes: 1,023 <b>pieces</b> melted. White {{metal and}} zinc <b>pieces</b> {{are known to}} have been struck. The zinc <b>pieces</b> were {{allegedly}} fixed {{in the center of a}} target during the shooting festival. If hit, the shooter would be given a larger award.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the ceramic}} {{fragments}} recovered from Panorama Sector, 374 <b>pieces</b> have been dated to the Late Classic, representing 62% {{of the total}} ceramics found in the sector. The vast majority of these are domestic in nature. 234 <b>pieces</b> were dated to the Terminal Classic, representing the remaining 38%.|$|E
5000|$|Assault: If a <b>piece</b> {{with a small}} value, {{multiplied by}} the number of vacant spaces between it and another larger <b>piece</b> is equal to the larger <b>piece,</b> the larger <b>piece</b> is captured.|$|R
50|$|The {{first player}} must place a <b>piece</b> inside, or touching, the center circle. Then, every <b>piece</b> played must touch the <b>piece</b> {{previously}} {{placed on the}} board. So, on a player's turn, they must place a <b>piece</b> so it touches the <b>piece</b> that was just played by the previous player.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piece</b> en <b>piece</b> or <b>piece</b> sur <b>piece.</b> Similar to post-and-plank above: Uses short logs (e.g. 8' long) lying {{horizontally}} between upright posts, resembling post-and-beam construction (but usually {{lacking the}} complex notching seen with post-and-beam). <b>Piece</b> en <b>piece</b> typically uses a large (8"x 8") vertical corner post. It {{is important that}} a vertical component (often 3"x 6") be placed {{on both sides of}} each window and door.|$|R
5|$|Other notable piano <b>pieces</b> by Mendelssohn {{include his}} Variations sérieuses, Op. 54 (1841), the Rondo Capriccioso, {{the set of}} six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35 (written between 1832 and 1837), and the Seven Characteristic <b>Pieces,</b> Op. 7 (1827).|$|E
5|$|Other {{well known}} <b>pieces</b> by Janáček include the Sinfonietta, the Glagolitic Mass (the text written in Old Church Slavonic), and the rhapsody Taras Bulba. These <b>pieces</b> and the {{above-mentioned}} five late operas were all {{written in the}} last decade of Janáček's life.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken <b>pieces</b> are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken <b>pieces.</b> Once the <b>pieces</b> {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken <b>pieces,</b> with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the <b>pieces</b> render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken <b>pieces</b> are close to being done the temperature is raised and the <b>pieces</b> are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
25|$|The kings, drunken elephants, blind tigers, ferocious leopards, {{reclining}} dragons, Chinese cocks, old monkeys, evil wolves, generals, angry boars, cat swords, coiled serpents, dark spirits, Devas, go betweens and pawns only move one square at a time. If an opponent's <b>piece</b> {{occupies a}} square {{that is a}} possible destination for the moving <b>piece,</b> the opponent's <b>piece</b> may be captured by placing the moving <b>piece</b> on that square, and removing the opponent's <b>piece</b> from the board. If a friendly <b>piece</b> (that is, a <b>piece</b> controlled by the same player) occupies the square, the moving <b>piece</b> may not move in that direction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piece</b> {{moves are}} as in {{standard}} shogi, {{apart from the}} queen (妃将 or 妃 hishō or okisaki [...] "princess") and the knights (跳馬 or 跳 chōma), which move as in Western chess, and the lance, which can move directly forward or backwards (standard shogi knights and lances can only move forward.) An opposing <b>piece</b> is captured by displacement: That is, if a <b>piece</b> moves to a square occupied by an opposing <b>piece,</b> the opposing <b>piece</b> is displaced and removed from the board. A <b>piece</b> cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly <b>piece</b> (meaning another <b>piece</b> controlled by the moving player).|$|R
