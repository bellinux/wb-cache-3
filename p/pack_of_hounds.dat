5|$|Due to its graphic content, Ultime grida dalla savana has {{encountered}} censorship issues with certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut {{version of the}} film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. The cuts include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, {{the death of a}} fox by a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds,</b> and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{since the}} {{introduction}} of the hunting ban, a number of hunts have employed falconers to bring birds of prey to the hunt, due to the exemption in the Hunting Act for falconry. Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{article in}} the The Guardian on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the {{permitted}} exemption allowing them to use <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds</b> to flush foxes to guns (an exemption which is strongly opposed by people against hunting).|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{sport of}} fox hunting {{as it is}} practised in North America places {{emphasis}} on the chase and not the kill. It is inevitable, however, that hounds will at times catch their game. Death is instantaneous. A <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds</b> will account for their quarry by running it to ground, treeing it, or bringing it to bay in some fashion. The Masters of Foxhounds Association has laid down detailed rules to govern the behaviour of Masters of Foxhounds and their packs of hounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{traditional}} hunts {{have bought}} {{birds of prey}} and {{say that they are}} using hounds to flush foxes so that the bird of prey can hunt them. The Act requires that the intention must be [...] "for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal." [...] Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds.</b> If this view proves to be correct, then it is unlikely that such a use of dogs is lawful.|$|E
2500|$|Well-to-do hunters {{of the era}} were {{typically}} accompanied by a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds</b> and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would [...] "go to ground" [...] or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to be big enough to tackle the quarry, but not so big as {{to prevent them from}} maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark underground den without the help of human handlers.|$|E

2500|$|As Arthur Haygarth says in Scores & Biographies, John Willes was: [...] "...the originator, {{or rather}} the reviver, of round-armed bowling, and is said (though his {{daughter}} has {{never heard of the}} fact) to have caught the idea from seeing his sister so deliver the ball to him in practice when he was unwell. [...] The Cricket Field, however, speaking through William Beldham, states: Willes was not the inventor of that kind of round bowling—he only revived what was forgotten or new to the young folk. [...] Whether he bowled round in the present match (i.e., in 1806), cannot now be said, as this kind of delivery was not tolerated till about 1827, when it was permanently established by William Lillywhite, Jem Broadbridge and Mr George T Knight. In the MCC v Kent match on 15 July 1822, Mr Willes commenced playing for his county but, being no-balled, he threw down the ball in high dudgeon, left the ground immediately, and (it is said) never played again. [...] Mr Willes was also a great sportsman, and kept a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds</b> at Sutton. [...] This place, shortly before his death, he was obliged to leave, and he removed to Staunton, near Gloucester, where he died, in fearfully reduced circumstances on 5 August 1852, aged 74. [...] No tombstone has been erected to his memory".|$|E

60|$|And {{then all}} the birds rose up, and {{streamed}} away in long black lines, north, and north-east, and north-west, across the bright blue summer sky; and their cry was like ten thousand <b>packs</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds,</b> and ten thousand peals of bells. Only the puffins stayed behind, and killed the young rabbits, and laid their eggs in the rabbit-burrows; which was rough practice, certainly; but a man must see to his own family.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{attempt to}} specifically hunt a fox with hounds was in Norfolk, in the East of England, in 1534, where farmers began chasing down foxes with their dogs {{as a form}} <b>of</b> pest control. <b>Packs</b> <b>of</b> <b>hounds</b> were first trained specifically to hunt foxes in the late 17th century, with the oldest such fox hunt {{likely to be the}} Bilsdale in Yorkshire.

50|$|In February 2002 the Scottish Parliament voted by eighty {{three to}} thirty six to pass {{legislation}} to ban hunting with hounds.
