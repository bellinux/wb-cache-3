Finish {{blanking}} {{is one of}} {{the precision}} shearing processes and it has some features such as the formability of a high ratio of the burnished surface, lower surface expansion ratio of the burnished surface.

40|$|International audienceSome {{parts of}} {{electrical}} machines are built from stacks of thin steel sheets, {{for which the}} coarse grain microstructure allows for minimizing magnetic losses. The fabrication process of these parts usually involves punching operations that generate important defects on the edges. Since these alterations {{may result in a}} degradation of the fatigue strength, this study aims at elaborating on a fatigue design strategy for such punched parts. To reach this objective, high cycle fatigue tests are performed on different specimens with either <b>punched</b> or polished <b>edges.</b> The results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens. Scanning electron microscope observations of specimen facture surfaces reveal that defects on <b>punched</b> <b>edges</b> are at the origin of the fatigue cracks. The influence of temperature is also investigated. Fatigue tests are performed at ambient temperature (20 °C) and at 180 °C. According to the experimental results, no significant influence on the median fatigue strength is observed. Since crack initiation always occur on the edges, additional investigations are performed to characterize how edges are altered by punching operations. Residual stresses are determined on <b>punched</b> <b>edges</b> using x-ray diffraction techniques. As a consequence of punching, important tensile residual stresses exist along the loading direction. In association with the stress concentration caused by geometrical defects, residual stresses promote crack initiation and fast crack propagation. For a better understanding of crack initiation, edge geometries are scanned with a 3 D optical profilometer, allowing us to identify the critical defect.

An attempt is made to assess and quantify the initial damage state and the damage evolution during mechanical testing of a <b>punched</b> <b>edge</b> and a machined edge via a recently developed 3 D imaging technique called synchrotron radiation computed laminography. This technique allows us to observe damage in regions of interest in thin sheet-like objects at micrometer resolution. In terms of new experimental mechanics, steel sheets having sizes and mechanical boundary conditions of engineering relevance can be tested {{for the first time with}} in situ 3 D damage observation and quantification. It is found for the investigated DP 600 steel that the fracture zone of the <b>punched</b> <b>edge</b> is rough and that needle-shape voids at the surface and in the bulk follow ferrite-martensite flow lines. During mechanical in situ testing the needle voids grow from the fracture zone surface and coalesce with the sheared zone. In contrast, during in situ mechanical testing of a machined edge the damage starts away from the edge (∼ 800 μ m) where substantial necking has occurred. Three-dimensional image analysis was performed to quantify the initial damage and its evolution. These data can be used as input and validation data for micromechanical damage models. To interpret the experimental findings in terms of mechanical fields, combined surface digital image correlation and 3 D finite element analysis were carried out using an elasto-plastic constitutive law of the investigated DP steel.

Recently there has been a growing interest in the designing and manufacturing the muffler tube due to the strict environmental regulations. The technique of perforating on the muffler tube has been largely affected by the shear clearance. And considering the concentration of the force around the <b>punch</b> <b>edge,</b> it is essential to reduced it through the punch radius. In this research, finite element analysis has been carried out to predict optimal forming conditions of the muffler tube using DEFORM TM- 3 D.

According to the simulation results, when the shear clearance is 0. 04 mm, the punch radius is 0. 05 mm and the value of plate holder force is 250 KN, the relation of load-stroke for punch is optimized.

The use of punching process to obtain these components specially affects their mechanical behavior and fatigue strength. This work aims at studying the influence of punching operations on the fatigue behavior of a Fe-Si alloy. High cycle fatigue tests are performed on different smooth specimen configurations with either <b>punched</b> or polished <b>edges.</b> Results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens compared to polished ones. To understand {{the origin of the}} fatigue failure on punched specimens, SEM observations of the fracture surfaces are carried out. They reveal that crack initiation always occurs on a punch defect. Additional experimental techniques are combined to characterize how the edges are altered by punching. The impact of punching operations on residual stresses and hardening is then investigated. Residual stresses are quantified on <b>punched</b> <b>edges</b> using X-ray diffraction techniques. Important tensile residual stresses exist in the loading direction as a result of punching operations. Also, according to XRD analyses and micro-hardness measurements, the hardened zone depth is about 200 µm. To dissociate the respective influences of strain hardening, residual stresses and geometrical defects, a heat treatment is applied to both punched and polished specimens in order to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the high cycle fatigue resistance. Results show that the geometry of defects {{is one of the most}} influent parameters. Consequently, a finite element model is developed to simulate the influence of edge defects on the fatigue strength of punched components. A non-local high cycle fatigue criterion is finally used as post-processing of FEA to consider the effect of defects and the associated stress-strain gradients in the HCF strength assessment...|$|R

To study edge fracture behavior of AHSS, a comprehensive hole expansion test (HET) program has been carried out on a DP 780 sheet. Specimen with three different edge conditions (milled edge, water jet cut <b>edge</b> and <b>punched</b> <b>edge)</b> are manufactured and tested. Results reveal that the hole expansion ratio (HER) of the present DP 780 sheet is around 38  % for milled specimen and water jet cut specimen, and about 14  % for punched specimen. A novel method of a central hole specimen tension is also introduced for edge fracture study, showing a similar trend as found in HET. The paper briefly presents a procedure and the results for a full calibration of the DP 780 sheet for plasticity and fracture, where a hybrid testing/simulation method is used to obtain parameters for Hill 48 plasticity model and modified Mohr–Coulomb fracture model. The finite element simulation gives an accurate prediction of HER, as well as the load displacement response and specimen deflection distribution in the hole expansion tests on uncracked material. The correlation between simulation and tests on central hole specimen also turns out to be very good.

Furthermore the possibility to recovery the magnetic and energetic original properties by mean of subsequent annealing treatments is reported too. The proposed methodology {{is based on a}} full experimental approach. Five toroidal cores, with the same geometrical dimensions, have been assembled overlapping a different number of laminations shaped as concentric rings. The rings have been obtained by means of a punching process: in this way the five cores have consistent differences in terms of <b>punched</b> <b>edge</b> length. The comparison between the magnetic and energetic properties on the five cores has put in evidence in qualitative and quantitative ways the punching process effects. In order to quantify the recovery of the magnetic and magnetic properties of the magnetic material, an annealing process has been applied on five other cores, twins with the first five. In addition, the cores have been tested at several frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to 100 Hz and the separation between eddy current and hysteresis losses has been obtained. The experimental test on the annealed cores has highlighted a heavy recovery of the hysteresis loss increase due to the punch process and a reduction of the global specific iron losses. The annealing process allows recovery of the specific losses with a reduction of about 40 %, due to a hysteresis contribution reduction. On the base of the results obtained on the cores two twin 11 kW induction motor have been assembled. The first one with a standard stator core, the second one with an annealed stator core.

Due to the significant dearth {{of research on}} <b>punching</b> shear at <b>edge</b> steel column, this study focuses on the design and performance of a novel shearhead system proposed for edge connection. By considering multi-stage processes and parameters that influence punching shear failure, both numerical and experimental studies were adopted. Firstly linear finite element analysis was employed to study {{the relationship between the}} continuous structure and the representative specimen; in order to support decisions on boundary conditions that create the similitude. A nonlinear (NLFEA) model was proposed where various concrete material constitutive models were compared and contrasted. The Total Strain crack model was adopted on the ground that it accounts for the tensile strength of cracked concrete which was ignored in previous theoretical model that lead to poor prediction of punching shear. By considering the appropriate material constitutive model for concrete and steel, material parameters, appropriate modelling scheme capable of predicting punching shear was formulated. The adopted modelling scheme was validated using previous research work. Numerical results reveal that punching shear is influenced most significantly by concrete tensile strength, fracture energy. The shearhead assembly was design with using ACI 318 - 05 and Newzealand codes recommendations with some modifications. These are only codes that provide design guidance on shearhead. Experimental and numerical results show that the shearhead contributes appreciably to punching shear capacity of the edge connection.

The potential risk of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) limits the widespread application of AHSS, {{making it one of the}} hottest topics in materials engineering and the automobile industry. The current work focused on the hydrogen-induced cracking of 1180 MPa steels for car body constructions. Various mechanical tests and forming tests to investigate internal hydrogen assisted cracking as well as hydrogen environment assisted cracking were conducted, concerning the automobile production processes and conditions during the life of a car. Tests of component-similar samples were carried out to compare laboratory results with those from the situation close to reality. The susceptibilities of various steels to HE were characterized and compared. The test methods were evaluated in the terms of differentiation and simplicity. Additionally, the material- and process-immanent factors on HE-susceptibility were elucidated and discussed. The results obtained in this work reveal that the immersion test with U-bend samples and the incremental loading test are appropriate to evaluate the HE-susceptibility for the material release process. Factors such as the presence of retained austenite, the high content of carbon equivalent and the coarse grain size increase the HE-susceptibility of AHSS. However, the addition of carbide-immanent elements Ti and Nb, and the alloying elements related to pitting corrosion resistance like Cr, Mo, N reduces the material HE-susceptibility. In the production processes the welding point and <b>punched</b> <b>edges</b> are sensitive to HE. The strain state during the forming process and the corrosive surroundings during the life of a car are also significant in the safe application of AHSS in car bodies.
