40|$|American {{vice presidents}} have become {{influential}} and powerful political figures. Yet, {{they are not}} popularly elected; since 1940, they have been personally selected by the <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> themselves. This thesis examines these selections in further detail, seeking to identify which characteristics the <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> {{look for in a}} running mate. The reseach question is the following: Which factors explain the vice presidential selections from 1940 to 2008 ? The theoretical framework for the thesis is a limited one, since the selection of vice presidents has yet to attract much scholarly interest. There are, however, three discernable theories in the literature. First, there is the ticket-balancing theory, representing the traditional explanation on the subject. It expects <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> to select running mates that complement them in some way, come from large states and/or have rivalled them for the presidential nomination. The theory of increased complexity, on the other hand, claims that these traditional selection criteria {{is only part of the}} explanation and should be supplemented by a set of modern selection criteria. Finally, the theory of changed dynamics contends that traditional selection criteria no longer govern the selections. Now, the presidential nominees' primary concern is to select a running mate with political experience. The three theories are assessed comparatively, through the use of a conditional logistic regression. The data is provided by Douglas Kriner and Jody Baumgartner. The evaluation of the theories indicates that the ticket-balancing theory has less explanatory power than the two other theories. Thus, the thesis proposes a synthesis model that combines the theory of increased complexity and the theory of changed dynamics. This model shows that <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> generally have chosen ambitious running mates that enjoy much media coverage, whilst they do not pick running mates that rivalled them for the presidential nomination. Also, a difference over time is observable: Prior to 1976, <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> tended to pick running mates from populous states, but the same tendency is not existent after 1972. Lastly, the <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> have probably been conscious of the running mates' genders and ethnic backgrounds: Some have wanted the tickets to be demographically balanced, whilst most would not even consider the possibility of such balance...|$|R
