40|$|Abstract: Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) protection {{has been}} a very important reliability issue in microelectronics, especially for integrated <b>circuits</b> (ICs). ESD <b>protection</b> design for giga-Hz high-speed input/output (I/O) circuits {{has been one of the}} key challenges to implement high-speed interface circuits in CMOS technology. Conventional on-chip ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> at the I/O pads often cause unacceptable performance degradation to high-speed I/O <b>circuits.</b> Therefore, ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> must be designed with minimum negative impact to the high-speed interface circuits and to sustain high enough ESD robustness.

Without the field oxide boundary across the p/n junction of diode structure, the proposed PMOS-bounded and NMOS-bounded diodes can sustain much higher ESD stress, especially under the reverse-biased condition. Such PMOS-bounded and NMOS-bounded diodes are fully process-compatible to general CMOS processes without additional process modification or mask layers.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the {{susceptibility}} of integrated circuits to electrostatic discharge (ESD) induced damages has justified the use of dedicated on-chip <b>protection</b> <b>circuits.</b> Design of robust <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> remains a challenging task because ESD failure mechanisms have become more acute as device dimensions continue to shrink.

50|$|The doubly-fed {{generator}} rotors are typically wound with 2 to 3 {{times the number}} of turns of the stator. This means that the rotor voltages will be higher and currents respectively lower. Thus in the typical ± 30% operational speed range around the synchronous speed, the rated current of the converter is accordingly lower which leads to a lower cost of the converter. The drawback is that controlled operation outside the operational speed range is impossible because of the higher than rated rotor voltage. Further, the voltage transients due to the grid disturbances (three- and two-phase voltage dips, especially) will also be magnified. In order to prevent high rotor voltages - and high currents resulting from these voltages - from destroying the IGBTs and diodes of the converter, a <b>protection</b> <b>circuit</b> (called crowbar) is used.|$|E
