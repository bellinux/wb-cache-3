40|$|Murine L 1210 leukaemia cells expressing {{either the}} reduced folate carrier (RFC) or the {{membrane}} folate receptor (MFR) were studied in vitro and in vivo {{to assess the}} dynamics of membrane transport of two categories antifolates; folate-based inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (methotrexate, edatrexate, aminopterin, PT 523, and PT 644) and thymidylate synthase (TS) [CB 3717, raltitrexed, <b>plevitrexed</b> (BGC 9331), pemetrexed and GW 1843]. The potency of in situ inhibition of TS {{was used as an}} endpoint to analyze the in vitro dynamics of RFC/ MFR-membrane transport of these antifolates. Both for L 1210 -RFC and L 1210 -MFR cells, the potency of in situ TS inhibition was closely correlated with increasing aYnities of these transporters for the antifolates (r = 0. 64, P < 0. 05 and r = ยก 0. 65, P < 0. 05, respectively). Within the group of antifolates for which MFR had a low binding aYnity, those that had the ability to become polyglutamylated, were more potent inhibitors of TS in situ activity than non-polyglutamatable antifolates. In vivo activity of methotrexate, edatrexate, raltitrexed and pemetrexed was assessed in L 1210 -RFC and L 1210 -MFR bearing mice that were fed either a standard or a folate-deWcient chow. Dietary folate depletion signiWcantly reduced the MTD for methotrexate (sevenfold), edatrexate (sevenfold), raltitrexed (50 -fold) and pemetrexed (150 -fold). Based on increased life spans, antitumor eVects of methotrexate and edatrexate were markedly better in L 1210 -RFC bearing mice on the folate-deWcient chow (ILS: 455 and 544...|$|E
