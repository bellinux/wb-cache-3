5|$|Saint Anselm {{came out}} of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s with no major {{disturbances}} or riots on campus despite various bomb threats called into campus, often from parties outside the college.

Students, faculty and members of the monastic community held prayer services and rallies throughout campus after the shootings.|$|E
