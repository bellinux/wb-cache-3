40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is {{scientific}} substantiation {{of the importance of the}} individual characteristics of the age specific youth development which will result in the rational modelling of studentsâ€™ physical education. Methodology and research methods. The methods involve collection of experimental data carried out by means of evaluation of motor abilities and general intelligence of students. Motor abilities of students were studied by measuring of strength (dead lift dynamometry), strength endurance (<b>pull-up),</b> <b>speed</b> and power abilities (standing jump), as well as speed ability (running 30, 60 or 100 m, depending on age), aerobic endurance (running 1000 or 3000 m, depending on age). The dynamics of integral physical preparedness (DIPP) of each student was calculated by calculation the arithmetic mean values of the growth rates of the development of motor abilities. Assessment of General Intelligence (GI) of the 8 th, 10 th and 11 th-grades school pupils as well as the 1 st to 3 rd year students was carried out through the test of R. Amthauer in the adaptation of L. A. Yazykova, and school pupils of the 6 th grade were assessed through the Intelligent Test (GIT). Results. Discrepancies in the dynamics of the mental and motor areas development of maturing personality, which are interpreted as individual characteristics of the age specific development are experimentally revealed. Individual psychological differences leading to the different susceptibility to the development of motor and intellectual abilities appearing in adolescence and early adolescence are analysed. A leading role of activity in formation of the individual characteristics of the age specific development is substantiated. The conclusion of necessity to formulate to the students differing in individual characteristics of the age specific development differentiated in the complexity requirements and motor tasks in the course of physical training is made. Scientific novelty. For the first time scientific evidence of sustained differences in the dynamics of the physical fitness of students with different levels of general intelligence is obtained on the basis of the experimental research. Scientific substantiation of factors affecting the formation of the individual characteristics of the age specific development is given. Practical significance. The findings serve as the basis for developing of the differentiated approach to the organization of physical education, taking into account individual characteristics of the age specific development. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} one/rev rotor {{aerodynamic}} loads which arise in tiltrotor aircraft during airplane-mode high <b>speed</b> <b>pull-up</b> and push-over maneuvers is examined using a coupled rotor/fuselage dynamic simulation. A modified eigenstructure assignment technique {{is used to}} design a controller which alleviates the in-plane loads during high pitch rate maneuvers. The controller utilizes rotor cyclic pitch inputs to restructure the aircraft short period and phugoid responses {{in order to achieve}} the coupling between pitch rate and rotor flapping responses which minimizes the rotor aerodynamic loading. Realistic time delays in the feedback path are considered during the controller design. Stability robustness in the presence of high frequency modeling errors is ensured through the use of singular value analysis...|$|R
