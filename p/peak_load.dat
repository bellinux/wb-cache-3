5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E

We present an IT network model that projects both average and <b>peak</b> <b>loading</b> for a system that is expanding traffic at multiple data sources. The average loading is modeled by independently calculating the traffic growth for all data sources. The future cumulative load distribution is calculated by taking into account historical sources of parameter correlations and scaling to account for future average growth.

25|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} (CAES) {{is a way}} to store energy {{generated}} at one time for use at another time using compressed air.

Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives. Large scale applications must conserve the heat energy associated with compressing air; dissipating heat lowers the energy efficiency of the storage system.|$|E

25|$|Time of Day {{metering}} (TOD), {{also known}} as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this {{can be used to}} automatically control usage {{on the part of the}} customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage, or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the utilities to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also Demand-side Management (DSM).|$|E

40|$|Ship {{structures}} are frequently subjected to random loads which are mainly induced by waves. These are interrupted by harbour times where {{loading and unloading}} cause different static loads as well as single <b>peak</b> <b>loads.</b> The effect of various static <b>loads</b> and single <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> on fatigue life was investigated in a parallel research project at the University of Rostock by experiments and computations for different structural components and random loads. In the project described here, special aspects have been investigated: 1. computation of the linear and non-linear stress distribution in a complex structural component typical for ships, i. e. the intersection between a longitudinal and a transverse web, and prediction of the crack initiation life using different approaches. 2. calculation of the accumulated damge for load sequences with changing mean stress and single <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> with the objective to verify simplified methods for practical application. The {{results show that the}} crack initiation life can be predicted with sufficient accuracy also for complex structures if local approaches are applied. However, the fatigue life of notches subjected to compressive stresses is far underestimated. Concerning load sequences with changing mean stress and single <b>peak</b> <b>loads,</b> simplified approaches are possible if partial stress spectra are considered, which have to be derived taking into account the rainflow counting method.

30|$|The {{daily average}} grid load {{profiles}} {{for four months}} are shown in Fig.  4. As observed in the figure, the active power demand varies between 150 kW and 410 kW in the Fall season. The maximum loading without PEV loads at this transformer is 40 % of the rated power. The peak and lowest demands occur around 21 : 00 and 05 : 00, respectively. The time frame where <b>peak</b> <b>loading</b> occurs also coincides with the vehicle home arrival times. According to the triple tariff determined by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) of Turkey, the peak times correspond to the hours between 17 : 00 and 22 : 00. As shown in the figure, <b>peak</b> <b>loading</b> mostly occurs in these hours but also extends beyond 24 : 00. If the loads were shaved according to the peak hour definition by EPDK, the peak shaving operation would not be fulfilled effectively. Therefore, to determine the <b>peak</b> <b>loading</b> region depending on the load profile, a new reference line is used which was described in Section III-B.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} new guidance {{concerning the}} hydrodynamic loads on submerged intake structures located {{in shallow water}} under breaking and non-breaking waves. Results {{from a series of}} experiments conducted in a large wave flume at 1 : 15 scale to study the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a generic intake structure located on a sloping seabed in shallow water below breaking and non-breaking irregular waves are presented. Based on analysis of the experimental data, empirical relationships are developed to describe the <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> in terms of characteristic wave parameters such as significant wave height and peak wave period. The distribution of the <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> across different parts of the intake structure is also described.
