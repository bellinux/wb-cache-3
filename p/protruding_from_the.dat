5|$|The Temple of Al-lāt {{is largely}} ruined {{with only a}} podium, a few columns and the door frame remaining. Inside the compound, a giant lion relief (Lion of Al-lāt) was {{excavated}} and in its original form, was a relief <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> temple compound's wall.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it {{is located}} {{underneath}} the western sector of the palace {{at a depth of}} almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.|$|E

5|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The exterior of the building has about fifty total ornaments <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> building's corners at five different floors in a way similar to the gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles, (a nod to the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States), while the 31st-floor contains gargoyles and replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps at its corners. The building is constructed of masonry with a steel frame, as well as metal cladding, and currently contains a total of 3,862 windows on its facades.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December, Pellew agreed formal {{terms for}} the {{surrender}} of Revolutie, Pluto, Kortenaar and the Dutch East Indiaman Rustloff that were anchored in Griessie. However, when British boats entered the harbour {{it was discovered that}} Cowell had issued orders for all four ships to be scuttled, their wrecks <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shallow water. Unable to remove the ships, Pellew ordered their remains burnt, while British landing parties spread throughout the town, burning the military stores and destroying the cannon that had been removed from the ship. Another landing party took possession of the remains of the battery at Sambelangan and demolished it. British operations were complete by 11 December and Pellew then ordered the squadron to withdraw and return to India.|$|E
5|$|The ancient cathedral {{was modeled}} on the Assumption Cathedral of the Kiev Monastery of the Caves. It used the Greek cross plan {{prevalent}} {{during the time of}} the Kievan Rus, six pillars, and three apses. A miniature church, likely a baptistery, adjoined the cathedral from the south. There was also a tower with a staircase leading to the choir loft; it was incorporated into the northern part of the narthex rather than <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main block as was common at the time. It is likely that the cathedral had a single dome, although two smaller domes might have topped the tower and baptistery. The interior decoration was lavish as its high-quality shimmering mosaics, probably the finest in Kievan Rus, still testify.|$|E

5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1836, a group of five {{fishermen}} caught their nets on timbers <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on , Henry Abbinett became {{the first person to}} see the Mary Rose in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, John Deane and William Edwards, were employed. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet, Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the Board of Ordnance for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and the fishermen who had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing the fishermen a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the Mary Rose from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid on 25 April 1926. Deteriorating economic conditions associated with {{onset of the}} Great Depression necessitated the scaling back of the project. The original cathedral, less its sanctuary, was retained as the nave of an expanded cathedral.

25|$|The {{tower is}} in fact {{composed}} of three distinct architectural elements: the central round tower, a smaller secondary tower (containing a spiral staircase), and a square corps de logis <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tower.

25|$|The Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie, is an aquatic being which reputedly inhabits Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands.

Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933.
