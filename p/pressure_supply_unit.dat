40|$|To achieve {{automatic}} labeling {{on the end}} {{surfaces of}} bundles of round steels for the steel plants, {{on the basis of}} the analysis of round steel production process, a set of automatic system for labeling on the round steel end surfaces of bundles is designed. The system includes the robot visual location unit, the label supply unit, the <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit,</b> the automatic labeling unit, the laser ranging unit, and the host computer communication control unit, etc [...] In the system, the robot visual location unit provides the round steel center location, and the automatic labeling unit implements automatic labeling on the round steel. The system is tested under lab condition, which shows the system can effectively solve the artificial labeling problems such as fault paste and leakage paste of workers, and realize efficient and stable automatic labeling. The system can be used in sleel plants for automatic labeling on the end surfaces of bundles of round steels...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} in <b>supply,</b> a <b>unit</b> must be within 20 movement points of a <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> that is part of a <b>supply</b> chain. Unsupplied <b>units</b> are unable to move or attack, and defend at half strength. <b>Supplied</b> <b>units</b> can move and defend normally, and attack at half strength. Units within 8 MP of a <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> receive a higher level of supply, and can attack at full strength. By expending a <b>supply</b> <b>unit,</b> the combat strength of units within 8 MP is temporarily doubled ("Maximum Attack Supply").|$|R

50|$|Supply is a {{key factor}} in this game, {{as it was in the}} {{historical}} campaign. Supply is typically provided by <b>supply</b> <b>units,</b> which are indicated by markers on the map. Each side must have a chain of these markers back to a supply base, with each <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> within 20 movement points of the next. <b>Supply</b> <b>units</b> can be captured or moved about by each player's truck unit, but both sides normally only receive one such unit. As the truck only has 40 MP and must move back and forth to carry the <b>supply</b> <b>units,</b> this can severely hinder the advance of a supply line. Additional truck units may be generated by immobilising combat units.|$|R

40|$|A {{device for}} the AC switch-on {{limitation}} of an inductive power <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) features {{a set of}} primary electrical AC power switches (23, 45) connected in series and a phase control circuit which enables {{the connection between the}} primary winding (4) and the AC power supply (25, 26) which is delayed after the instant of switch-on. The control electrode (44, 45) of the initial electrical AC power switch (23) of the phase control circuit with power supply backup (30) is connected to the output of a control circuit which enables a synchronized igniting voltage to be generated when the power <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) is switched on from a preset (60, 61) phase angle of between 90 and 0 degrees before a zero crossing (115) of the AC power supply (2, 25, 26). The igniting voltage can be suppressed in order to switch off the power <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) prior to reaching a zero crossing (115) of the AC power supply (2, 25, 26). A capacitor (86) connected in parallel with the power <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) enables the remanence to be set before switch-on and after switch-off so that the power <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) can be switched on under any conditions without the risk of an inrush peak current in excess of the load current...|$|R
