40|$|Since April 2007, health {{insurance}} companies in Germany have been entitled to negotiate drug discount contracts (DDCs) with pharmaceutical manufacturers for particular drugs. DDCs commit pharmacists to dispense the drug made by this manufacturer. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how DDCs are implemented in pharmacy routines and what implications DDCs have for the everday drug supply. Methods: A standardized questionnaire on DDCs and their impact on the drug supply was developed according to the previous literature, piloted and distributed to pharmacies in Baden-Württemberg. Results: Eight hundred four pharmacists and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>assistants</b> participated in the study. The implementation of DDCs implies significant extra work for pharmacists, particulary the additional need for customer counseling and education (99. 1 %), additional logistical requirements and more complex data processing needs. Patients are reported to get confused (97 %) and angry (96. 9 %) about non-transparent drug substitutions, and medication errors occur (60. 1 %). Conclusion: DDCs, besides having implications for prescibers and patients, also have a substantial impact on pharmacists and pharmacies.

40|$|Abstract: We {{carried out}} the study to assess, using field surveys and {{personal}} dosimetry, the potential exposure of pharmacists and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>assistants</b> to 60 Hz magnetic fields in a medical center of Taiwan. Field surveys were conducted twice in the pharmacy where two workers were randomly selected and solicited to wear personal dosimetry instruments for a full-shift assessment of personal exposure. We used an EMDEX II for on site measurements and did not consider any specific instrument or equipment for health care services as potential sources of magnetic field. The {{results showed that the}} average magnetic flux densities for the selected areas were between 0. 63 mill-Gauss (mG) and 2. 23 mG, while the full-shift time-weighted-average exposure for the two selected workers was 4. 98 mG and 6. 54 mG, respectively. Both inadequate consideration for the field survey of the temporal variability in magnetic flux densities over the workday and that the monitored workers spent almost half of the full-shift working in places outside of the study areas may have contributed to such discrepancy in results between field survey and personal dosimetry. This study suggests that the potential for elevated exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields in health care settings does exist, and that using job title as a surrogate for magnetic fields exposure classification might entail certain degrees of misclassification. Although limited in its scope and sample size, the study presented here seems to demonstrate the inadequacy of using stationary workplace measurements for the assessment of personal occupational exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields...|$|R

Inspite of the course offered to dispensers in ADDOs by the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority; on detection and treatment of common infectious diseases; there has been a gap on patient’s assessment, diagnosis, treatment and counselling tasks in accordance with the evidence based standards. This study assessed the dispensers’ knowledge, drugs stocked and dispensing practises in ADDOs in Morogoro Region. A cross-sectional analytical study of 220 randomly selected dispensers from 220 ADDOs in the three Districts of Morogoro Region; conducted between October and December 2012. Questionnaire interview sessions conducted to assess knowledge of malaria symptoms and reported practises. A checklist was used to assess presence of anti-malarial drugs, treatment supplies and guidelines available. The actual practises were assessed using the “Simulated clients” method. Data analysis was done using SPSS software. Chi square test was used to compare proportions and a p-value of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Of the total dispensers, Nurse Assistants 206 (94 %), Nurse Officers 9 (4. 1 %); Clinical Officers 3 (1. 4 %) and <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Assistants</b> 2 (0. 9 %). More than half (54 %) of them attained secondary while the rest had primary education. 185 (84. 1 %) of the total, trained TFDA special course.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Under {{reporting}} of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare personnel {{is a common}} problem of many Pharmacovigilence programs. Lack of involvement of healthcare professionals such as pharmacists and other pharmaceutical dispensers has been cited {{as one of the}} reasons for under reporting. Pharmaceutical dispensers in the community pharmacies are in unique position by virtue of their training and profession to observe ADRs in patients, as many patients often try to avoid doctor consultation fees by visiting community pharmacies. The knowledge and ability of dispensers in Tanzanian community pharmacies to identify and report ADRs is however unknown. Study objective: To determine the knowledge, attitude and practices of dispensers in community pharmacies in Dar es Salaam towards the ADRs reporting. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted involving 254 dispensers from selected retail pharmacies in Dar es Salaam region. SPSS version 16 was used for data entry, cleaning and subsequently analysis. Results: The majority of personnel working in community pharmacies are non pharmaceutical professionals i. e 52 % were nurse assistants. Community dispensers have limited knowledge and practices with regard towards ADRs reporting. Only 13. 8 % of respondents had good ADRs reporting knowledge, while only 8. 7 % had ever submitted ADRs reports to the relevant authorities. There was a significant difference in the level of knowledge with regard to ADRs reporting between Pharmaceutical professionals (i. e Pharmacists, Pharmaceutical technicians and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>assistants)</b> and non <b>Pharmaceutical</b> professionals (P value = 0. 000). The knowledge levels correlated positively with profession and attendance of continuous professional education courses (CPE). The majority of dispensers (68. 9 %) however had a positive attitude towards ADRs reporting. Conclusion and Recommendations: Community pharmacies dispensers in Dar es Salaam have limited knowledge and experience with regard to ADRs reporting. Thus community pharmacies in Dar es Salaam cannot presently act as centres to collect data on ADRs effectively.

40|$|Background: The city of Dar es Salaam {{is growing}} very rapidly in all sectors. The {{increase}} {{of the population in}} the city also reflects the need of pharmaceutical services. However, delivery of pharmaceuticals to the society should be in accordance to direction given in the prescription, except for over the counter drugs (OTC). But, there has been a tendency for prescription medicines being dispensed without prescription order. Study Objective: To investigate prescription challenges facing community medicine outlets in delivery of pharmaceutical services in Dar es Salaam region. Materials and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was conducted from October 2012 to June 2013. A total of 228 participants were interviewed (where 140 pharmacies and 88 DLDM), obtained by calculating 30 % of eligible participants within the strata population plus 10 % for attrition rate. They were selected by simple random sampling technique using computer software package from a strata population list, to have equal representation from Pharmacy and DLDM. Questionnaires, simulated client who was appeared at medicines outlet to buy prescription medicines without a prescription and physical observation of prescription book and prescriptions retained for the whole year 2012, were used to interview medicines dispenser in the pharmacy and in the DLDM. The views of the stakeholders (i. e. MSH and PST) and specific organizations (i. e. MoHSW and Regulatory authorities) relevant to this study were sought. Results: Among 228 respondents participated in the study, 61. 4 % (140) were from the pharmacies and 38. 6 % (88) from DLDM. The majority of them 82. 9 % (189) being female while male being only 17. 1 % (39). Professionally, 10. 5 % (24) of respondents were pharmacists, 9. 7 % (22) were pharmaceutical technicians, 4. 4 % (10) <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>assistants</b> and the rest 75. 4 % (172) were none-pharmaceutical professions (i. e. medical doctor, clinical officers, nurse midwifes and nurse assistants). Among the none-pharmaceutical personnel carders who are medicine dispensers 65. 8 % (150) were nurse assistants. However, 47. 7 % (82) of all non pharmaceutical personnel participants received training on ADDO while the majority that is 52. 3 % (90) was not. The majority of the medicine outlets i. e. 90 % (126) of pharmacies and 97. 7 % (86) of DLDM sell prescription only medicines without a prescription. However, among 6 respondents who did an in-depth interview, they all agreed on having a prescription challenges in the health system. Out of all medicine outlets 228 participated in the study, 38. 2 % (87) that prior have shown to have prescription book, only 25. 9 % (59) that kept record in their prescription book. However, 32 % (73) of medicine outlets that retained prescription copies for the whole year 2012, only 22 % (50) that had real stored prescription copies. Conclusion: Despite the existing effort to alleviate the problem of selling prescription medicines without prescription at the level of medicine outlets, yet there is a significant problem of malpractice which has been continued within the health system, it has now developed into being a character within the entire health sector. This study has found to be like treating symptoms while the causative agent left untreated. Pharmacy Council should strengthen its inspection on the medicines delivery points in private health facilities both by type of medicines stored and by level of medicine dispensers, should enforce the existing laws in order to keep balance between enforcing regulation and performance of the dispensers. Yet, how profit aspirations and internet services contribute to self medication is still not known. Recommendations: The government in collaboration with other stakeholders should train more qualified medicine dispensers. To develop an agency that will be responsible for preparation, distribution and monitoring the use of prescription at all levels by using its number and also it will be overseeing the conduct of all professions as well as to use multi-sector approach within the health sector to sensitize use of prescription for prescription only medicines. And to establish health guidelines that directing private hospitals and dispensaries to prepare and use duplicated prescription copies.

Study participants: A pharmacist or (if unavailable) the most experienced drug dispenser Results: No private hospital pharmacies mate all the quality requirements; however all have qualified pharmacist only 88. 7 % had a Pharmaceutical Technician {{and none of them}} had an <b>Assistant</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> technician. All hospital pharmacies had Dispensing and Storerooms. Only 80 % of the pharmacy had all minimum required furniture and equipment in Dispensing room. No pharmacies had all equipment for dispensing. Books used for reference, most of the hospital pharmacy. cies were using the British National Formulary and Tanzania National Formulary while fewer reported to be using the TFDA List of Registered Medicines (13. 3 %), or the National Essential Drugs List (20 %) and Good Dispensing Manual (8. 7 %). Only 73. 3 % had Expired Drugs Book and inspection Reports Registers book and almost % had prescription only medicines book and controlled drugs Book, few had books for Complaints Handling (40 %), Visitors (27. 8 %), and Written procedure for maintenance of cold chain products (8. 7 %) Among the hospital pharmacies studied 39 % do not train their staff pharmacy members at all, 27 % train their staff pharmacy members per year. The same percentage (27 %) carryout staff training when need arise and the remaining 8 % train their staff pharmacy members after each six months. Almost all interviewed hospital pharmacies practice Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with only 1 % deviating from this practice.

40|$|Occupational {{diseases}} {{are a significant}} issue worldwide. These diseases cause major economic and social problems and influence statistics representing sick-leave periods, disabilities, and even deaths. In the developed countries, work within {{the health care system}} is considered among the jobs that are associated with highest risk of developing occupational skin diseases, diseases caused by biological materials as well as illnesses of musculoskeletal systems. In the European Union, approximately 15 % of the employees state that they spend over a half of their working day in the environment that is polluted with toxic materials. Within the health care system and the social care sector, 17 % of the employees manage or are exposed to toxic materials and products, while 12 % work in the environment where, in the air that they breathe, there are aerosols, dust, and biological materials. Between 4. 0 % and 13. 0 % of the European Union employees think that their immediate work environment is directly related with health problems. Up to 13 % of the personnel working in the health care system and the social care sector are convinced that chemical materials present in the work environment serve as causes of skin problems that they experience. In the United States, up to 14 % of the health care personnel develop bronchial asthma, an illness that is caused by working conditions. Moreover, 43 % of nurses and 29 % of doctors experience micro-traumas (pricking – in the majority of cases). As a result, they can be affected by biological materials. In Europe, the risk of musculoskeletal diseases is highest in the spheres of agriculture, construction works, and health care sector. The standardized rates of musculoskeletal system diseases for 100, 000 employees are highest in the health care and the social care sectors, i. e. 4, 260 cases. Up to 37. 5 % of the health care and the social care personnel experience work related stress, 15. 0 % ─ depression, and 10. 3 % ─ anxiety. These employees suffer from fatigue which they experience as a consequence of psychological stress caused by long-time contact with suffering (ill) people or as a reaction to a patient’s death. 5. 3 % of the health care and the social care personnel experience abuse at work places, and 15. 7 % ─ threats. In recent years, abuse and threat at work places, as a major factor influencing work environment, has received much attention. There had been earlier reports regarding victims’ pain, emotional distress, physical invalidation, and ruining of a career though, only in recent years, the problem has been subjected to scholarly investigation. An in-depth research has been performed in Scandinavian countries, where there exist important factors such as informed society, state financed studies, and strict laws governing abuse. In 2003, 13, 682 doctors, 2, 372 dentists, 26, 229 nurses, 2, 390 pharmacists, 1, 245 <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>assistants,</b> and 7, 894 other specialists with university or college degree worked the health care sector in Lithuania. In the same year, health care personnel constituted 3. 74 % {{of the total number of}} employees in Lithuania. The data, if interpreted with regard to the occurrence of occupational diseases, reveals a peculiar phenomenon – the occurrence of occupational diseases among the health care system personnel is only 1. 75 % of the diagnosed occupational diseases in Lithuania or 0. 0009 % of the total number of the employees in Lithuania. The present study aims to assess the interdependence between health problems among nurses and work environment in the health care institution (X) as well as to suggest means for the prevention of health problems. For the fulfillment of the aims, the following objectives were formulated: 1. 	To investigate data obtained from the nurses regarding their subjective assessment of health condition and work environment. 2. 	To determine and to assess the prevailing health related problems and to investigate their dependence on chemical factors within work environment of the nurses in the institution (X). 3. 	To determine and to assess the prevailing health related problems and to investigate their dependence on psychological factors within work environment of the nurses in the institution (X). 4. 	To determine and to assess ergonomic work conditions and to delineate interdependence with the impairment of musculoskeletal system. The novelty of the present research is embedded in the fact that it has been the first time that a complex study of the interdependence between health problems of the health care sector personnel and their work environment has been conducted. Within the Lithuanian context, for the first time, research into ergonomic work conditions of nurses has been done using research framework developed at Cornell University, USA (Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire). This has been used to determine the relationship between ergonomic factors of work environment and health problems of the musculoskeletal system. The present research will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the specificities related to work conditions of nurses in health care institutions of Lithuania. By extension, it will help find ways to reduce hazardous factors within work environment. The relationship between health problems and work environment determined in the present study will enable to define priorities leading to improvement of work conditions not only in the target institution but also in other health care institutions of Lithuania. 	The data obtained in the present research have already been presented as study material for undergraduate and graduate students of Kaunas University of Medicine. The topic of the present research has been central in presentations delivered at three conferences; two articles published in reviewed scholarly journals abroad, and in a Lithuanian reviewed scholarly magazine...|$|R
