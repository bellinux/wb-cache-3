To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a <b>proper</b> <b>reason,</b> then a boat would come to take them over.

2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, {{there is always}} the possibility that a small electric spark will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as a}} kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, it may not be a Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the <b>proper</b> <b>reason</b> it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to saying that you cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E

6000|$|The brougham was a {{token of}} harmony, of the fine {{conditions}} papa would this time offer: he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a four-wheeler behind for the boxes. The four-wheeler with the boxes on it was actually there, but mamma was the only lady {{with whom she had}} ever been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a private carriage. Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, still more private, somehow, than mamma's; and when at last she found herself quite on top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she put to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the continuity of a certain sentiment. [...] "Did papa like you just the same while I was gone?" [...] she enquired--full of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence. She had bethought herself that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be only intermittent and for the season. Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst into one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was, seemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and make her jump. Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied: [...] "Why, you little donkey, when you're away what have I left to do but just to love her?" [...] Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had a merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria. Then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely: [...] "I shall make him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that to you I shall carry you straight off and we'll go and live somewhere together and be good quiet little girls." [...] The child couldn't quite make out why her father's speech had been horrid, since it only expressed that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as [...] "immense." [...] To enter more into {{the truth of the matter}} she appealed to him again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn't been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now. [...] "Of course she has, old girl--where else could the poor dear be?" [...] cried Beale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who protested that unless he straightway [...] "took back" [...] his nasty wicked fib it would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too and his house and his tiresome trouble--all the impossible things he had succeeded in putting on her. Beale, under this frolic menace, took nothing back at all; he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating his extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that she was not to listen to his bad jokes: she was to understand that a lady couldn't stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully <b>proper</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

These assumptions are about continuity of solution space and differentiability {{of the objective}} function. Fortunately, meta-heuristic methods are not limited by such assumptions. We are usually seeking an optimum or even proper values for non-differentiable measurement functions in real-world problems. Moreover, calculating partial derivatives may be so hard and computationally expensive for multivariate functions in real-life problems. Searching discrete solution space is another challenge in real-world problems.

Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have <b>proper</b> <b>reasons</b> and rationales for arriving at a particular decision.

[...] Accordingly, the court set aside the second and third rezoning refusals as they did not comply with the law. The court ordered the municipality to reconsider the congregation's application. The congregation had argued that such as a remedy was inadequate because it argued that the municipality was likely to again refuse the application, though with <b>proper</b> <b>reasons.</b> However, the court rejected this argument because it implies that the congregation was entitled to a particular substantive decision, instead of merely to a fair process.
