40|$|Purpose: As a {{continuation}} of a previous paper [1], the report demonstrates the various possibilities of float <b>polishing</b> utilizing the present improved magnetic compound fluid (MCF). The MCF developed by one of authors, Shimada, in 2001, was improved {{by the addition of}} α-cellulose, thereby achieving a clearance as great as 8 mm as shown in another paper [1]. The present paper describes the possibility of the application of the MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique with α-cellulose. Design/methodology/approach: First, the results obtained under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of the MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique are described. These conditions include the various shapes of the magnet employed in the <b>polishing</b> tool, magnetic field strength, the concentration of α-cellulose, the motion of the specimen, the existence of a magnet fixed underneath the <b>polished</b> specimen, and initial surface roughness. Secondly, the present MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique can be used in many types of <b>polishing,</b> including <b>polishing</b> the inner surface of an acrylic resin tube, a wide flat surface {{through the use of a}} orbital <b>polishing</b> tool, and simultaneous float <b>polishing</b> of all surfaces of a three-dimensional complex shape. In addition, as other examples, the <b>polishing</b> on the integrated circuit (IC) substrate is shown. Findings: By the various <b>polishing</b> conditions of the MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique, the <b>polishing</b> effect is changed. On the other hand, as for the many applications of the MCF float <b>polishing,</b> inner surface, wide flat surface, rough initial surface, three-dimensional complex shape and IC substrate can be <b>polished.</b> Research limitations/implications: The data under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of the MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique helps to clarify the present <b>polishing</b> technique’s possible practical applications. As shown in a previous paper [1], since MCF contains long magnetic clusters, the present <b>polishing</b> technique allows float <b>polishing</b> with large clearance. Therefore, many applications of the MCF float <b>polishing</b> are useful in the <b>polishing</b> fields. Practical implications: The present study indicates the practical application in the <b>polishing.</b> Originality/value: The present technique of MCF float <b>polishing</b> is new in the field of float <b>polishing.</b> In addition, the ordinary float <b>polishing</b> technique having large clearance has not been proposed.

5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the <b>Polish</b> Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the <b>Polish</b> state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary <b>Polish</b> detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported <b>Polish</b> sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's <b>Polish</b> Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there.

5|$|In many respects, {{the history}} of the <b>Polish</b> Underground State mirrors that of the <b>Polish</b> non-communist {{resistance}} in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland's Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the <b>Polish</b> capital of Warsaw, {{at a time when the}} <b>Polish</b> defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from <b>Polish</b> Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century <b>Polish</b> National Government and World War I-era <b>Polish</b> Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the <b>Polish</b> Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the <b>Polish</b> state continued to administer its occupied territories.|$|E

30|$|As the <b>polishing</b> {{surface is}} highly nondeterministic, {{one of the}} reasons is that the <b>polishing</b> path of the tool affects the removal considerably.

Therefore, the study of removal function of different <b>polishing</b> path has a very important significance. A lots of <b>polishing</b> paths in mechanical <b>polishing</b> process can be found in literatures [13]-[18]. The ultimate goal of the research about different <b>polishing</b> removal function is to select an optimal <b>polishing</b> path so as to avoid any under-polishing and over-polishing phenomenon and ensure the uniformity of the <b>polishing</b> process. Meanwhile, it can also present a clear understanding of the various factors that influence the <b>polishing</b> quality.
