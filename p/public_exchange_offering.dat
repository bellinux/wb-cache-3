5000|$|Private <b>exchanges</b> and <b>public</b> <b>exchanges,</b> {{also known}} as <b>public</b> health {{insurance}} <b>exchanges,</b> both enable the purchase of benefits through an online marketplace. However, private exchanges are offered by employers for use by active and/or retired employees and include health insurance {{and other types of}} benefits. <b>Public</b> <b>exchanges,</b> on the other hand, were established under the Affordable Care Act to give individuals the opportunity to purchase health insurance, often with a government subsidy if eligible. Private exchanges are operated by private entities such as brokers, carriers and technology companies, while <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> are operated by individual states or the federal government or via a federal/state partnership. Finally, private exchanges typically offer varying degrees of decision support, or ways to guide employees through the benefits selection process, through education and system recommendations. Private exchanges may be accessed by employees throughout the year to review their benefits or make qualifying changes to their coverage, whereas <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> currently lack decision support and can only be accessed for Open Enrollment except {{in the case of a}} qualifying event.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of markets when traders are {{given the opportunity to}} create their own market, as on the internet. On the internet, <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> have in many cases been replaced by private exchanges. We use experiments to investigate possible reasons for the failure of <b>public</b> <b>exchanges.</b> In our experimental markets, when traders make an offer, they decide whom to inform about the offer. Participants typically inform all traders {{on the other side of}} the market, but not on their own side, resulting in a private, not a <b>public</b> <b>exchange.</b> This private exchange leads to the same outcomes in terms of prices and efficiency as a double auction. When we impose transaction costs on the buyers, only the sellers make private offers, which results in an inefficient market. When we provide incentives for sellers to inform each other, most of the sellers reveal a strict preference to hide offers from rivals. However, when sellers do share price information, they attain a higher price and benefit collectively. ...|$|R
