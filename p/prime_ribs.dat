5000|$|While Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm {{were run}} by the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), Operation Provide Comfort came under the {{authority}} of the U.S. European Command (EUCOM), headquartered in Vaihingen, Germany. On-ground humanitarian aid was provided by the 353rd Civil Affairs Command, Bronx, New York City, and by subordinate units 432nd Civil Affairs Battalion, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and 431st Civil Affairs BN, Little Rock, Arkansas. These units were relocated to Turkey and Northern Iraq after completing missions in Kuwait. They were soon joined by Lieutenant Colonel Ted Sahlin's 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which had only returned to the U.S. two weeks before after having been deployed to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait for the past 10 months. The base camps that were established for Kurdish refugees were nicknamed Camp Jayhawk and Camp Badger after college mascots. Other camps were established in Silopi, Turkey the first troops to arrive were the 36h CES from Bitburg Air Base Germany, the 36th CES which built all base camp and facilities for multi-national troops sent to assist with the operation. Smaller [...] "detachment" [...] camps were also built in and around Zakho, Iraq and Sirsenk, Iraq by these same members and were led by USAF Prime BEEF commander Captain Donald Gleason from Ramstein Air Force base and USAF <b>Prime</b> <b>RIBS</b> personnel from RAF Bentwaters. He led a team of fifteen that is now known as the first Air Force unit to enter Iraq. Supplies for these camps were sourced from a variety of areas including units that were returning to the U.S., Coalition countries, European military stocks, and civilian contractors in the U.S. Many supplies had to be airdropped due to restrictions by the Turkish government for entering Iraq through their border.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>rib</b> is {{generally}} prepared by cooking to low temperatures for long times {{to attain the}} desired tenderness and juiciness. Destruction of Salmonella spp. in blade tenderized <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> was examined by following cooking procedures commonly used by chefs. Beef ribs (boneless) were inoculated with Salmonella spp. to attain initial surface levels of about 5. 75 log 10 CFU/cm 2. The ribs were blade tenderized (one pass) using a Ross blade tenderizer. Each was split into two equal sections. One half was cooked to a target internal temperature of 110 {{and the other half}} to 120 °F, then tempered at room temperature for up to 60 min and placed in a holding oven (120 °F) for up to 120 min. Reductions of 4. 54 and 4. 80 log 10 CFU/g were attained for roasts removed from the oven at 110 and 120 °F, respectively. Even though <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> preparation utilizes very low cooked product temperatures, the long cooking time and tempering period result in substantial process lethality and a safe final product...|$|R

40|$|Beef <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> is a {{delicacy}} cooked at {{low temperatures}} for long period and extended hot holding prior to consumption. Due {{to the potential}} survival and outgrowth of foodborne pathogens, this process may pose a public health risk. Considering {{an increase in the}} availability of non-intact beef, the microbial safety of the preparation of <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> from intact and mechanically tenderized beef was evaluated. In the first study, lethality of the <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> (from intact and non-intact, blade tenderized beef) cooking process to Salmonella spp. was evaluated. Boneless beef rib eye was surface inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of Salmonella spp. to obtain ca. 5. 9 log CFU/g. The inoculated blade tenderized subprimals were passed with the fat side facing the blades to prepare non-intact beef rib eye. The subprimals were seared for 15 min at 260 °C, cooked at 121 °C to internal temperatures of either 37. 8 or 48. 9 °C and held at 60 °C for up to 8 h. The searing of blade tenderized rib eye resulted in 0. 63 log CFU/g reduction in Salmonella spp. and cooking to internal temperatures of 37. 8 and 48. 9 °C resulted in 2. 86 and 3. 58 log CFU/g reduction in Salmonella spp., respectively. Subsequent holding of the blade tenderized <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> at an oven temperature of 60 °C for 8 h resulted in an increase of 1. 99 log CFU/g in Salmonella spp. population. Thermal processing of intact rib eye resulted in 5. 22 and 5. 54 log CFU/g reduction of Salmonella spp. population after cooking to 37. 8 and 48. 9 °C respectively. Subsequent holding at 60 °C during 8 h resulted in an increase in Salmonella spp. population of 1. 07 and 0. 44 log CFU/g, respectively. In the second study, the growth of C. perfringens during hot holding and cooling was evaluated. Ground rib eye was dispensed in 5 -g pouches, inoculated to obtain 2. 5 spores/g of C. perfringens, and vacuum-packaged. C. perfringens spores were heat activated and the pouches with the inoculated meat were held at 43 or 49 °C. Hot holding of inoculated rib eye resulted in germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores by 6. 5 and 6. 05 log CFU/g. Abusive cooling of cooked <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> from 57. 2 to 5 °C within 6, 9, 12, and 15 h resulted in C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth by 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 2. 2 log CFU/g respectively. Use of non-intact rib eye can pose an enhanced risk of foodborne illness when <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> is cooked to low end point temperatures, held for extended periods of times at these low temperatures, and cooled at slow rates.
