5|$|Not listed is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable 'acquisition', the 2001 {{merger with}} Time Warner to become AOL Time Warner. Due {{to the larger}} market {{capitalization}} of AOL, it gained ascendancy in the merger, with its executives largely displacing Time Warner's despite AOL's far smaller assets and revenues. AOL was spun off as its own independent company from Time Warner in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} temperature record can be reconstructed from sedimentary evidence. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> useful {{indicator of}} past climate is the fractionation of oxygen isotopes, denoted '18O.

5|$|To {{have reached}} its {{enormous}} size within its relatively short (geologically speaking) 600,000 to 1,000,000 years of life, Mauna Loa would logically {{have had to}} have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history, and extensive charcoal-based radiocarbon dating (<b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on Earth) has amassed a record of almost two hundred reliably dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara {{became famous}} {{in the field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, in the court of Vikramaditya VI. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were Sangita Chudamani, Sangita Samayasara and Sangita Ratnakara.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

5|$|By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E
5|$|By the Iron Age, Scotland {{had been}} {{penetrated}} by the wider La Tène culture. The Torrs Pony-cap and Horns are <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impressive {{of the relatively}} few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain. The Stirling torcs, found in 2009, are a group of four gold torcs in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the Greek and Roman worlds.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Scotland was {{targeted}} by Nazi Germany {{largely due to}} its factories, ship yards and coal mines.http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/world_war2/scotlands_blitz/ Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant air-raid in Scotland was the Clydebank Blitz of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area. 528 {{people were killed and}} 4,000 homes totally destroyed.|$|E
