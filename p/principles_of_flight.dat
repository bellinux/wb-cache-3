5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> and human factors.

5|$|In 2000, Duxford {{announced}} plans for the redevelopment of Hangar 1, previously known as the 'Superhangar', which {{was built in the}} 1980s. The plans would expand the building by 40%, providing more display and conservation space, improve internal conditions, and enable the museum's British and Commonwealth aircraft collection to be brought under cover. Planning permission was received later that year. The project cost £25 million and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the East of England Development Agency and BAE Systems, which contributed £6 million.

25|$|The {{different}} velocities {{of the air}} {{passing by}} the wing, the air pressure differences, the change in direction of the airflow, and the lift on the wing are intrinsically one phenomenon. It is, therefore, possible to calculate lift {{from any of the}} other three. For example, the lift can be calculated from the pressure differences, or from different velocities of the air above and below the wing, or from the total momentum change of the deflected air. Fluid dynamics offers other approaches to solving these problems—and all produce the same answers if done correctly. Given a particular wing and its velocity through the air, debates over which mathematical approach is the most convenient to use can be mistaken by novices as differences of opinion about the basic <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E

Following a short introduction, the paper is organised in three main sections. First we review the basic <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> ranging using time correlated single photon counting. Second, we present some basic theory of how data is acquired from multiple surfaces. Third, we present some initial measurements on common transparent objects.

40|$|Innovative {{teaching}} experimental {{activities for}} {{secondary school students}} have been developed in order to introduce some aerodynamic concepts, {{with the aim of}} making science subjects such as mathematics and physics more attractive. Post-graduate students of Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and teachers of Deutsche Schule Madrid (DSM) have constructed a small wind tunnel. The main goal has been to provide a tool for secondary school students to become familiar with the scientific method developing curiosity, imagination, initiative, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students of DSM have performed wind tunnel experiments, resulting in a successful and amusing experience. The students were able to relate the experimental results obtained with the physic <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight,</b> previously explained in class.

40|$|Purpose. This article {{appears to}} be {{essential}} both {{from the point of}} view of theoretical understanding of the processes of transformation of social identity, and {{from the point of view}} of practical problem solving related to social human behavior and social groups.

The results of the study are that regional identity is weakly pronounced and negative in nature due to the adverse factors of formation of territorial communities of the Republic of Komi. Awareness of the complex problems related to economic and transport fragmentation of the region make necessary the formation of regional identity as a mechanism of integration of the community in Russian society.
