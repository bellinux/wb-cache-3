50|$|Various {{researchers}} have undertaken extensive life cycle assessments of biodegradable polymers {{to determine whether}} these materials are more energy efficient than polymers made by conventional fossil fuel-based means. Research done by Gerngross, et al. estimates that the fossil fuel energy required to produce a kilogram of <b>polyhydroxyalkanoate</b> (PHA) is 50.4 MJ/kg, which coincides with another estimate by Akiyama, et al., who estimate a value between 50-59 MJ/kg. This information {{does not take into}} account the feedstock energy, which can be obtained from non-fossil fuel based methods. Polylactide (PLA) was estimated to have a fossil fuel energy cost of 54-56.7 from two sources, but recent developments in the commercial production of PLA by NatureWorks has eliminated some dependence of fossil fuel-based energy by supplanting it with wind power and biomass-driven strategies. They report making a kilogram of PLA with only 27.2 MJ of fossil fuel-based energy and anticipate that this number will drop to 16.6 MJ/kg in their next generation plants. In contrast, polypropylene and high-density polyethylene require 85.9 and 73.7 MJ/kg, respectively, but these values include the embedded energy of the feedstock because it is based on fossil fuel.|$|E

40|$|Increased and {{accelerated}} global economic activities {{over the past}} century have led to interlinked problems that require urgent attention. The current patterns of production and consumption have raised serious concerns. In this context, greater emphasis has been put on the concept of sustainable economic systems that rely on technologies based on and supporting renewable sources of energy and materials. Average UK households produce around 3. 2 million tonnes of packaging waste annually whereas 150 million tonnes of packaging waste is generated annually by industries in the UK. Hence, the development of biologically derived biodegradable polymers is one important element of the new economic development. Key among the biodegradable biopolymers is a class known as <b>polyhydroxyalkanoates.</b> <b>Polyhydroxyalkanoates</b> (PHAs) are a family of polyhydroxyesters of 3 -, 4 -, 5 - and 6 -hydroxyalkanoic acids, produced by a variety of bacterial species under nutrient-limiting conditions with excess carbon. These water-insoluble storage polymers are biodegradable, exhibit thermoplastic properties and can be produced from renewable carbon sources. Thus, there has been considerable interest in the commercial exploitation of these biodegradable polyesters. In this review various applications of <b>polyhydroxyalkanoates</b> are discussed, covering areas such as medicine, agriculture, tissue engineering, nanocomposites, polymer blends and chiral synthesis. Overall this review shows that <b>polyhydroxyalkanoates</b> are a promising class of new emerging biopolymers. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the degradation of 10 -cis-heptadecenoic acid was found to be unaffected by the presence of rumenic acid in the media. Efficient degradation of rumenic acid was found to be independent of the Delta(3, 5),Delta(2, 4) -dienoyl-CoA isomerase but instead relied on the presence of Delta(3),Delta(2) -enoyl-CoA isomerase activity. The presence of the unsaturated monomer 3 -hydroxydodecenoic acid in <b>polyhydroxyalkanoate</b> derived from rumenic acid degradation was found to be dependent on the presence of a Delta(3),Delta(2) -enoyl-CoA isomerase activity.

40|$|Degradation of {{fatty acids}} having cis-double bonds on even-numbered carbons {{requires}} {{the presence of}} auxiliary enzymes {{in addition to the}} enzymes of the core beta-oxidation cycle. Two alternative pathways have been described to degrade these fatty acids. One pathway involves the participation of the enzymes 2, 4 -dienoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase and Delta(3) -Delta(2) -enoyl-CoA isomerase, whereas the second involves the epimerization of R- 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA via a 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase or the action of two stereo-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases. Although degradation of these fatty acids in bacteria and mammalian peroxisomes was shown to involve mainly the reductase-isomerase pathway, previous analysis of the relative activity of the enoyl-CoA hydratase II (also called R- 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase) and 2, 4 -dienoyl-CoA reductase in plants indicated that degradation occurred mainly through the epimerase pathway.
