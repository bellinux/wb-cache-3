40|$|Small fish often {{approach}} and "inspect" a detected predator from a short distance. This apparently paradoxical behaviour {{has been shown}} experimentally to incur a risk of death. To have a net benefit predator inspection behaviour must be advantageous. We tested experimentally whether a closer inspection distance per se provides inspecting three-spined sticlebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with more information about a <b>pike's</b> (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius)</b> hunger state. This prediction was confirmed: test fish that {{had been assigned to}} a close inspection distance started foraging earlier after they had inspected a satiated pike compared to those that had inspected a hungry pike. The fish could not assess the pike's hunger state as precisely from a far inspection distance. This was shown by a significant interaction between hunger state of the pike and inspection distance on the time to start foraging. The sticklebacks used the information gained from inspecting the predator because they attacked their own prey more frequently after they had inspected a satiated pike. This effect was most apparent when the fish attackeda high Daphnia density (which impairs vigilance) more frequently after they had seen a satiated pike from a close distance...|$|R
25|$|Although {{only one}} native fish species has become extinct in the Loire, namely the European sea {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser sturio) in the 1940s, the fish population is declining, mostly {{due to the}} decrease in the spawning areas. The latter are mostly affected by the industrial pollution, construction of dams and drainage of oxbows and swamps. The loss of spawning grounds mostly affects the <b>pike</b> (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius),</b> which is the major predator of the Loire, as well as eel, carp, rudd and salmon. The great Loire salmon, a subspecies of Atlantic salmon, {{is regarded as the}} symbolic fish of the river. Its population has decreased from about 100,000 in the 19th century to below 100 in the 1990s that resulted in the adoption of a total ban of salmon fishing in the Loire basin in 1984.

The two largest known reports are from coastal California and along the Porcupine River in Alaska, with fish making up 3.6% and 3.5% of the diets, respectively. Most reported species are trout and salmon from the Salmo and Oncorhynchus genera, although other species have also been hunted, including suckers (Catostomus), Sacramento perch (Archoptiles interruptus) and the northern <b>pike</b> (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius).</b> Fish have apparently been captured in Scotland on rare occasions, although they {{have not been}} reported in the breeding season diet. Golden eagles have been observed around the Sea of Okhotsk (especially along Northern Japan) to join large numbers of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Steller's sea eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus) in winter to scavenge and capture various, locally abundant fish amongst ice-floes. Perhaps the most improbable prey reported in the golden eagle's diet are insects. They've been reported in small quantities in the French Pyrenees, the Italian Alps and Bulgaria. There is no information on how golden eagles capture insects or what kind of insects they hunt, although slower, larger, terrestrial insects like large beetles seems likely.|$|E

Length (pike and perch) and age (perch and whitefish) were the strongest explanatory factors for the Hg fluctuations. Fish caught in December (pike and whitefish) had the highest Hg concentrations, while the concentrations in May were higher than in September for all 3 species, statistically significant for perch (P< 0. 0001) and close to significant for pike (P= 0. 07).  Higher δ 15 N signatures were found in December and May compared with September, but these differences {{might be related to}} fish body size variations.

40|$|Biomanipulation {{was carried}} out in order to improve the water quality of the small hypertrophic Lake Zwemlust (1. 5 ha; mean depth 1. 5 m). In March 1987 the lake was drained to {{facilitate}} the elimination of fish. Fish populations were dominated by planktivorous and benthivorous species (total stock c. 1500 kg) and were collected by seine- and electro-fishing. The lake was subsequently re-stocked with 1500 northern <b>pike</b> fingerlings (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius</b> L.) and a low density of adult rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus). The offspring of the rudd served as food for the predator pike. Stacks of Salix twigs, roots of Nuphar lutea and plantlets of Chara globularis were brought in as refuge and spawning grounds for the pike, as well as shelter for the zooplankton. The impact of this biomanipulation on the light penetration, phytoplankton density, macrophytes, zooplankton and fish communities and on nutrient concentrations was monitored from March 1987 onwards.

40|$|Traditional {{fisheries}} management theory supports aggressive exploitation {{of old and}} large fish to maximize a stock's biomass production and yield. Here we present an age-structured fish population model with multidimensional density-dependence to test the hypotheses that protection of large, fecund individuals is beneficial for the population and seleted fisheries variables and that effects of maternal size on early survival rate change the resilience and fisheries productivity of a <b>pike</b> population (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius</b> L.) exploited by recreational angling. We find that, compared to the traditional regulatory approach of management by small minimum- length limits (so that culling of large fish is encouraged), preservation of large and old individuals through harvestable-slot length limits promises considerable benefits for fisheries quality, without compromising the long-term conservation of the population. We also find that ignoring maternal effects on early survival of offspring might overestimate the equilirium spawning stock abundance by up to 17 % and the predicted harvest by up to 11 %, potentially putting pike populations at risk from overharvest if size-dependent maternal effects are ignored in fisheries models. If the findings from our simulation study hold for empirical systems, they suggest altered harvest regulations in many of consumptive pike recreational fisheries are needed to protect large individuals {{to a greater extent}} that currently pursued...|$|R

2500|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{are only}} an occasionally {{contributor to the}} diet in many regions. Most of the 30 or so species recorded have been taken as supplemental prey in Spain, i.e. several lizards (including geckos), frogs and toads, snakes and, to a lesser degree, turtles. One species widely and commonly reported in Europe outside of the Iberian region is the [...] common frog (Rana temporaria). It was the leading prey, making up 45% of the prey found at nests in Rogaland, Norway. Also, the common frog was the second most abundant prey species in studies from southern Sweden, Valais and Engadin in Switzerland, Verbano-Cusi-Ossola, Italy and an enormous study from Slovakia, in the latter 10,476 frogs recorded making up 28.2% of the prey. There are no records of vicious fights between snakes and Eurasian eagle-owls as there are with the great horned owl, with the horned owl sometimes losing its life after attacking a snake. Perhaps with their larger size and greater power, the eagle-owl can more easily overpower any snakes they encounter, although most snakes in Europe and temperate Asia are not particularly large. Like the golden eagle, the eagle-owl may attack spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). In Lebanon, a “large adult” tortoise, which {{would be at least}} as heavy as the eagle-owl itself, was among their food items, although how they handle and eat this large, hard-shelled prey is not clear. Eurasian eagle-owls also opportunistically prey on fish, although never in large numbers, as fish are likely to be taken incidentally while hunting for other prey such as water birds. This species is known to take a greater diversity of fish (more than 30 species verified) and is more widely reported to hunt them than the great horned owl. Most of the fish recorded are medium-sized, with at least 10 each of various kinds of carp or cod, but several species averaging more than [...] in mature mass have been taken, including common barbell (Barbus barbus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), northern <b>pike</b> (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius)</b> and a few species of trout, even bigger marine predators like the anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and European conger (Conger conger). However, in many cases small, young specimens may be caught of these large fish species rather than full-grown adults. Several species of insect and invertebrate have been identified in eagle-owl pellets. In some cases, these may be undigested insects in the stomachs of birds eaten by the eagle-owl but Eurasian eagle-owls have been verified as actively hunting insects and aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crabs before. Especially diverse in the diet are ground-based beetles, at least 20 species have been identified mainly those in the Carabus (ground beetle) genus.|$|E

40|$|Longtime {{tradition}} of fisheries in Czechoslovakia which {{dates from the}} 12 th century has some specific characteristics. Traditional technology of carp culturing (two and four years culturing) has been kept on 52 000 ha of fish farms basing its production by using natural fish food which gives the best quality of consumption fish. The results of the culture are: After {{the first year of}} culturing the average individual weight was 30 — - 50 g, {{at the end of the}} second year 250 - 500 g, at the end of the third year 1200 - 1800 g and at the end of the fourth year 2200 - 3000 g. Due to geographic and climate conditions in Czechoslovakia the individual weight could be even after the third year of life 2000 - 2800 g applying some specific technology. One of the method of the intensive fish production on carp ponds is polyculture. There is a list of fish used in polyculture with carp: predatory fish: <b>pike</b> fish (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius),</b> <b>pike</b> perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), sheat (Siluris glanis), eel (Anguilla anguilla), rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), (Coregonus lavaetus maraena, Coregenus peled), herbiovorous fish — grass carp, big head and silver carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Aristichthys nobilis) and tinch fish (Tinea tinea). Besides traditional technologies new industrial methods of intensive fish culturing are introduced using channels and net cages. An intensifications of fish culturing was enabled by artificial spawing of fish in the warm waste waters of energetic and industrial objects. The basic force in the development of fisheries in Czechoslovakia is scientific and researching activity as well as education.

40|$|With {{only one}} species of <b>pike</b> in Europe (<b>Esox</b> <b>lucius</b> Linnaeus, 1758), <b>Esox</b> {{systematics}} was considered settled for decades. However recent taxonomical studies of European pikes {{led to the}} discovery of two new species: Esox cisalpinus Bianco & Delmastro, 2011 from Northern and Central Italy, and Esox aquitanicus Denys et al. 2014 in the South-West of France. Within E. lucius sensu stricto, three different evolutionary lineages were identified with mitochondrial markers, a North-European, a South-European (Danubian), and a circumpolar lineage (Skog et al., 2014). French Northern pike belongs to the North-European lineage, but it is commonly reared in ponds and traded since the Middle Age at least, and it is widely stocked in open waters since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, leading to introgression with native populations (Launey et al., 2006). E. cisalpinus is similarly threatened by the non-native E. lucius (Gandolfi et al., 2014). Previous studies on pikes mostly used various mitochondrial loci, leading to dataset dispersion. We then developed a mitogenomic approach proved efficient for Teleost systematics in the last 15 years (Miya & Nishida, 2015). This study unifies fine-scale pike phylogeography using the complete mitochondrial genome for 13 E. lucius, 6 E. aquitanicus and 2 E. cisalpinus samples. The results distinguish the 3 pike species as well as the 3 lineages of E. lucius from Skog et al. (2014). The presence of individuals from the South-European and circumpolar lineages might result from stocking operations. Finally, molecular dating with reanalysis old fossil calibrations places the European pikes diversification during the late Miocene (E. aquitanicus vs. the others), the late Pliocene (E. cisalpinus vs. E. lucius), and the Pleistocene ice ages (E. lucius lineages).
