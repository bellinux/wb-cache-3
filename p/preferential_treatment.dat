At the same time, China also allowed mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis. As Hong Kong is already a free port, the <b>preferential</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are perceived to be}} more beneficial to Hong Kong than to China. From the perspective of China's overall strategy in trade liberalization, preferential trade with Hong Kong is consistent with the strategy of a regional approach, which is a supplement to the global approach with the World Trade Organization. ...|$|R

He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment,</b> and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> of the capital by the state. It {{was not until the}} middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E

5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment,</b> it is known primarily as a euphemism for mass murder used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his tour}} of duty Nash had been wary of <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> towards him due to his fame and opposed any {{attempts}} to promote him, which he believed he did not deserve.

Following his return to Australia, Nash sold War Bonds and appeared at war-related charity functions, including one where he raised an additional £100 by singing to the large crowd.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised. He promised to release all political prisoners.|$|E

Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers.

Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'.

These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full.

40|$|What are {{the effects}} of {{institutional}} subversion on small business development, fiscal policies, economic growth, and firm performance? This paper provides an empirical investigation of institutional subversion in Russia’s regions. We develop a complete account of <b>preferential</b> <b>treatments</b> to the largest regional firms in texts of regional legislation during 1992 - 2000 and use the concentration of <b>preferential</b> <b>treatments</b> {{as a proxy for}} legislative subversion. Based on cross-section and panel data analysis, we find that regional institutional subversion has an adverse effect on small business growth, tax collection, social public spending, and federal tax arrears. At the firm-level, regional political influence generates substantial gains to firms both in the long and the short run. These firms exhibit faster growth in sales, market share, and employment compared to their counterparts who are not politically connected. Firms that exercise political influence have higher profitability despite the lower labor productivity. We check the robustness of these results by looking at an alternative proxy for potential subversion based on size concentration in regional economies. The alternative approach produces similar results...|$|R

5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political parties are ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish monarchy {{appointed}} {{their own}} candidates {{to most of}} the political offices in the viceroyalty, usually favoring Spaniards from Europe. In most cases, the appointees had little knowledge of or interest in local issues. Consequently, there was a growing rivalry between criollos and peninsulars (those born in Spain). Most criollos thought that peninsulars had undeserved advantages and received <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> in politics and society. The lower clergy had a similar sentiment about the higher echelons of the religious hierarchy. Events developed at a slower pace than in the United States independence movement. This was in part because the clergy controlled the entire educational system in Spanish America, which led the population to hold the same conservative ideas and follow the same customs as in Spain.|$|E

Johnson County officials were upset that the group was not kept locally at Ft. McKinney. The general in charge of the 6th Cavalry felt that tensions were too high for the prisoners to remain in the area. Hundreds of armed locals sympathetic to both sides of the conflict were said to have gone to Ft.

5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E

When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
