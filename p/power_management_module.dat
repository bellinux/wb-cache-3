Uncoordinated operation of these knobs not only leads to suboptimal operation {{but may also}} cause unsafe behaviors. Coordination methods have thus been proposed to jointly control the power knobs and performance.

This occurs, for instance, in commodity software that runs on multiple platforms, and emerging cloud hosted applications that operate on platforms outside developers’ control and alongside unknown other workloads.

40|$|International audienceBiological {{fuel cells}} are devices capable of {{directly}} transforming chemical to electrical energy via electrochemical reactions involving biochemical pathways. Among others, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use bacterial metabolism at the anode to produce electricity {{from a wide}} range of organic substrate. While the idea of harvesting energy produced by MFCs is sprouting, two major issues need to be addressed: low power densities and high manufacturing cost. A typical 1 liter reactor produces no more than 10 mW of electrical power, while the costs of the materials to manufacture it is above 30 €. High price is caused by the use of nafion and platinum respectively in the membrane and the cathode. A lowcost (and low power density) MFC was built. Earthen membrane replaced nafion and biocathode replaced platinum cathode. Other more common works investigate single chamber air-cathode reactors where the membrane and the cathode are combined. Recent multidisciplinary works on reactor designs, electrodes, substrate and bacterial communities address price and performance issues altogether. In the near future, electrical engineers will contribute by designing adapted <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>modules</b> to capture and make use of the harvested energy. The way is long before MFCs can reach the present competitiveness of other renewable energy sources like photovoltaic modules.

40|$|Abstract: As {{information}} and communications technology matures, {{the nature of}} the infrastructure that supports it evolves and specializes. While the telephone infrastructure had been built as a network with central offices acting as hubs, the {{information and}} communications technology maintains a similar structure, but instead, has hubs of specialized Internet data centers which house the routers and servers. This paper updates one of the first studies to document the electricity consumption and power distribution within an Internet data center. For this study, electricity billing data, metering data, and facility floor space allocation data were used to calculate computer room, total computer room, and building power densities for July 2002. The results of this 2002 study indicate that although the data center had expanded its operations by roughly 33 % from the previous year and increased the electricity demand associated with the computer equipment by 55 %, the total computer room power density �which includes cooling and auxiliary equipment � remained the same as the previous year at 355 W/m 2. The facility’s efforts to improve energy efficiency offset the energy demand from an increased, electrically active, computer room area. The energy-efficiency measures included better optimization of power distribution units, <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>modules,</b> computer room air-conditioning units, alterations to operating conditions, facilitywide reductions in lighting, and improved facility controls. A key recommendation is to expand this research to address the need to develop metrics to capture the energy efficiency of the data network throughput...|$|R

This paper, for the first time, presents a combined power extraction with adaptive full analogue <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>module</b> (PMM) for increased piezoelectric energy harvesting. The PMM is adaptive to variations in the amplitude and frequency of vibration subjected to the piezoelectric strain energy harvester (SEH) and adaptive to different connected electrical loads, where it is used to power up a wireless sensor node (WSN).
