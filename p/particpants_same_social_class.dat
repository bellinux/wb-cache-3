40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>class</b> {{standardisation}} {{has been}} proposed as a method for separating the effects of occupation and "social" or "lifestyle" factors in epidemiological studies, by comparing workers in a particular occupation with other workers in the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> The validity of this method rests upon two assumptions: (1) that social factors {{have the same effect}} in all occupational groups in the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> and (2) that other workers in the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> as the workers being studied are free of occupational risk factors for the disease of interest. These assumptions will not always be satisfied. In particular, the effect of occupation will be underestimated when the comparison group also has job-related exposures which cause the disease under study. Thus, although adjustment for <b>social</b> <b>class</b> may minimise bias due to social factors, it may introduce bias due to unmeasured occupational factors. This difficulty may be magnified when occupational category is used as the measure of <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> Because of this potential bias, adjustment for <b>social</b> <b>class</b> should be done only after careful consideration of the exposures and disease involved and should be based on an appropriate definition of <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> Both crude and standardised results should be presented when such adjustments are made...|$|R

40|$|The earlier {{practice}} of assigning {{all members of}} a family to the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> {{as that of the}} household head, typically the father, has in recent years been replaced by either basing individual class position on one's own occupation or of one of the family members, not necessarily the father. These various practices have been extensively scrutinised for more than 20 years. The validity of the approaches has chiefly been tested by checking how well they account for the variation in some criteria, mostly class identification, political attitudes and voting behaviour. Here it is shown, using census data from Sweden, that mortality-rate differences between <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> covering the period 1991 - 1997 are greater {{for both men and women}} when both spouses are assigned to the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> on the basis of the dominance approach, where the labour market position of either spouse may determine the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> of the family. It is suggested that the common observation that class differences are smaller among women than among men may, at least to some extent, be the result of establishing a woman's class position on the basis of her own occupation rather than the labour market position of her spouse. <b>Social</b> <b>class</b> Measurement Mortality Conventional, individual and dominant approaches Sweden...|$|R

Our questionnaire survey similarly demonstrated that about 97 % of the respondents attributed their business successes to these social networking groups. About 93 % of the respondents had obtained business inspiration by meeting people at the market and participating in social networking activities.

5000|$|In the United States, the {{immigrant}} paradox {{is a phenomenon}} wherein immigrant youth have superior developmental outcomes than do native-born youth. Immigrants are also less likely to exhibit antisocial behavior than native-born Americans, though {{the generalizability of the}} [...] "paradox" [...] has been questioned. This phenomenon may be largely due to supportive social relationships, such as between adolescents and their parents. The phenomenon has also been attributed to immigrants' ability to work into the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> they belonged to in their original country. Other evidence suggests that the educational advantage of first-generation U.S. immigrant children may be entirely accounted for by race and maternal education.|$|R

There was social mobility in the sample: 45% of men were upwardly mobile, 14% were downwardly mobile and 41% were socially stable. IQ at age 11 had a graded relationship with participant's <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> <b>Same</b> effect was seen for father's occupation. Men at midlife <b>social</b> <b>class</b> I and II (the highest, more professional) also had the highest IQ at age 11. Height at midlife, years of education and childhood IQ were significantly positively related to upward social mobility, while number of siblings had no significant effect. For each standard deviation increase in IQ score at the age 11, the chances of upward social mobility increases by 69% (with a 95% confidence). After controlling the effect of independent variables, only IQ at age 11 was significantly inversely related to the downward in social mobility. Which means that more years of education help a man to surpass his father's <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> and that low IQ makes a man prone to fall behind his father's <b>social</b> <b>class.</b>|$|R

After having shown evidence for credential inflation of three educational transitions, it was shown that credential inflation between two generations increased the likelihood of making a transition into tertiary education in the Netherlands, and into high school completion and into 4 -year university degrees in the United States. This supports the theory that education functions as a positional good, and if education loses value people need more of it in order to reach the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> as their parents.

For example, historian Tim Blanning notes that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the Bill of Rights 1689, in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary absolute monarchies such as France - a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.|$|R

50|$|By 1880 {{the members}} of the grand juries and baronial {{sessions}} were still overwhelmingly Unionist and Protestant, and therefore totally unrepresentative {{of the majority of the}} population of the areas they governed.

The Representation of the People Act 1884 created a much larger electorate that had very different needs and inevitably wanted to elect local representatives from outside a narrow social élite. By now public works such as roads and bridges were being funded increasingly by central government via the Office of Public Works.|$|R

Most of the research on women while adequately documenting these facts, fails to contextualise them in a social, economic and political setting which is often responsible for the problems in the first place. This serious shortcoming negates the efficacy of the well-intentioned and well-meaning solutions in redressing the gender balance. Unless one examines the structural factors which actually cause disease, both in men and women in underdeveloped countries, solutions will be ineffective.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century some upper-class Victorians became motorists; consequently, for the first time ever, {{regulation}} and policing intersected with this class of society. By 1905 so many concerns had been raised about compromised public order and safety that the Victorian State Government attempted to implement a Motor Car Bill based on its English predecessor (1903). Wealthy motorists possessed power and influence, however, which contributed to the postponement of legislation until 1910. Additionally, parliamentarians were drawn from the <b>same</b> <b>social</b> <b>class</b> as motorists, and, in creating regulation, they were potentially regulating their peers, colleagues and friends.

5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks.
