25|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete beam-column joints – various retrofit solutions {{have been proposed}} and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for {{reinforced concrete}} joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external <b>post-tensioning</b> to the joint {{in order to achieve}} flexural hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design.|$|E

40|$|The biaxial {{response}} of two bridge piers is experimentally investigated. A <b>post-tensioned</b> precast bridge pier with external replaceable mild-steel dissipaters is tested under biaxial loading. The {{performance of the}} <b>post-tensioned</b> bridge pier is compared with a conventionally reinforced monolithic bridge pier. The experimental biaxial response is then compared with previous uniaxial experimental testing of identical bridge piers to understand the influence of biaxial loading, specifically concerning <b>post-tensioned</b> rocking sections. A 3 -dimensional moment–curvature and moment–rotation analysis program is created to generate the monotonic section {{response of}} a conventional and <b>post-tensioned</b> bridge pier. After comparing {{the accuracy of the}} section analysis program to the experimental testing of the monolithic pier, the program is validated against the experimental testing of the <b>post-tensioned</b> bridge pier. This section analysis program is then used in the calibration of a macro-model to capture the entire cyclic response of the <b>post-tensioned</b> bridge pier. The macro-model adopts multiple linear-elastic compression-only springs at the rocking interface, combined with non-linear inelastic springs for each of the mild-steel dissipaters and returns encouraging results at both local and global levels. The paper concludes with a number of biaxial moment-interaction design charts for monolithic and <b>post-tensioned</b> bridge piers as a function of mechanical and geometric section properties.

Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers.

The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical <b>post-tensioning</b> which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) is {{a composite}} material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. [...] Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and <b>post-tensioning.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fallingwater, one of Wright's {{most famous}} private residences (completed 1937), {{was built for}} Mr. and Mrs. Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., at Mill Run, Pennsylvania. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was {{designed}} according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house {{was intended to be}} more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home. The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using limestone for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces. Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done.

Design/methodology/approach: Four tests of <b>post-tensioned</b> high-strength self-compacting concrete flat slabs were conducted under fire conditions. Numerical modelling using the commercial package ABAQUS was conducted to help interpret the test results. Findings: Two of the specimens with lower moisture contents demonstrated excellent fire resistance performance, while the others with slightly higher moisture contents experienced severe concrete spalling. Originality/value: The test results were discussed in respect of thermal profiles, deflections, crack patterns and concrete spalling.

The influence of different parameters was investigated, including tendon properties (i. e. diameter, roughness), duct properties (i. e. diameter, thickness, material), initial prestress, concrete strength, grout strength, grout voids, stirrups, and strands, on the tendon re-anchorage.

The phase I comprises the questionnaire survey which dealt with the construction practices of multi-storied buildings in Sri Lanka including slab construction. The advantages, disadvantages and cost comparison were carried out for the reinforced concrete and <b>post-tensioned</b> concrete slabs. Phase II covers two study parts; one is the work study {{and the other is}} designs. For the work study, three building projects were selected and their costs were analysed. It confirms that the main cost in a multi-storeyed building is attributable to the slab and beams.

40|$|<b>Post-tensioned</b> timber joints {{have been}} studied at the,nstitute of Structural Engineering at the ETH =urich.

The developed joint is characterised by a high degree of pre-fabrication and easy assembly on site. The glue-laminated timber moment-resisting frame featuring this joint shows great potential for timber frame structures especially for multi-storey buildings. Robust performance-based design criteria are a necessity for a s uccessful market implementation of the proposed system. A simplified analytical model was developed in order to predict the structural performance of the <b>post-tensioned</b> timber connection and facilitate preliminary performance-based design. This model was implemented in 2 penSees using a bi-linear rotational spring approach. The model was verified against an analytical model and validated against tests on a <b>post-tensioned</b> timber joints under gravity loading and under horizontal loading. Moreover, a complex numerical model was developed using 2 penSees to check the accuracy of the proposed preliminary design model. The preliminary design model was used to design fictitious moment-resisting <b>post-tensioned</b> glue-laminated timber frame structures using the loads prescribed in the Swiss code. The design process showed that neither the gravity loads nor the seismic load controlled the design. The design was governed by the lateral deformations due to wind.
