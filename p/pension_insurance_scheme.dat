5000|$|In Case E-8/00 Landsorganisasjonen (commonly {{referred}} to as ‘LO’) the EFTA Court had to provide an Advisory Opinion. The issue before the national court was whether a number of Norwegian municipalities had breached certain provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement for Municipalities when they transferred their occupational <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> from one supplier, KLP, a private mutual life insurance company wholly owned {{by members of the}} Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities, to other insurance companies. The municipalities submitted that several provisions in the Basic Collective Agreement were void because they infringed Articles 53 and 54 EEA, the provisions mirroring Articles 81 and 82 EC. The contested provisions stated, inter alia, that {{in the event of a}} change of the pension company, this should be discussed with union representatives; that before the decision-making body might begin to deal with a possible change of company relevant offers for a new occupational pension scheme should be put before those members of the pension committee who represent the parties to the collective agreement; that the occupational pension scheme had to be based on a financing system that is gender-neutral and does not have the effect of excluding older employees; that before the matter might be decided upon by the municipality there had to be approval from the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund; and that the pension scheme had to be taken note of by the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission. The EFTA Court found that the relationship between the national law of collective bargaining and the EEA competition rules must be assessed by applying the test established by the ECJ in Case C-67/96 Albany and in related cases. It concluded that on that basis, the contested provisions would prima facie fall outside the scope of Article 53 EEA. If, however, the national court found that the contested provisions do not pursue their purported objectives, the provisions, in light of the objectives actually pursued, fall within the scope of Article 53 EEA. If so, and if the national court found that these provisions in effect required the municipalities to obtain supplementary pension insurance services from specific insurers, thus excluding, or severely limiting, their possibility of selecting other qualified service providers, these provisions were also held capable of constituting a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 53 EEA. The Court held that, in any case, the good faith of the parties in concluding and implementing a collective agreement must also be taken into account. When examining the several elements of a collective agreement, the national court must consider their aggregate effect. Whether an agreement restricts competition, and thereby infringes Article 53 EEA, is a legal question that must be examined in light of economic considerations. The EFTA Court found furthermore that Article 54 EEA may apply if the national court were to find that the supplier of the occupational pension scheme, KLP, enjoyed a dominant position in the relevant market, that an identification might be made between the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities and the supplier, and that their conduct in relation to the conclusion or the implementation of the contested provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement had in practice prevented transfers of supplementary pension insurance schemes from KLP to other insurance companies, in order to protect the position of KLP.|$|E

40|$|The Czechoslovak {{communist}} retirement protection scheme {{resembled the}} Bismarckian earnings-related pensions, with new benefits close to final salaries {{and with their}} insufficient indexation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the reform processes in Czechia and the potential for a simple technical reform that would make the public retirement schemes understandable and efficient. In the process of the transition to capitalism under liberal Czech governments, the prevailing concept of the public retirement scheme changed to a Beveridge model of pensions not being related to previous wages. The insufficient valorisation of bend points was the main method of this transition. Modern international pension theory recommends the separation of a solidary pillar and an earnings-related pillar. After the Czech “small” pension reform, a basic technical reform may be simply realised, resulting in a higher flat-rate pension and an NDC <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> convenient to parties with programmes based on three basic welfare regimes.

40|$|Among {{the systems}} {{in place in}} {{different}} countries {{for the protection of}} the population against the long-term contingencies of old-age (or retirement), disability and death (or survivorship), defined-benefit social security pension schemes, i. e. social <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes,</b> by far predominate, despite the recent trend towards defined-contribution arrangements in social security reforms. Actuarial valuations of these schemes, unlike other branches of insurance, continue to be carried out almost exclusively on traditional, deterministic lines. Stochastic applications in this area, which have been restricted mainly to occasional special studies, have relied on the simulation technique. This paper develops an analytical model for the stochastic actuarial valuation of a social <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme.</b> Formulae are developed for the expected values, variances and covariances of and among the benefit expenditure and salary bill projections and their discounted values, allowing for stochastic variation in three key input factors, i. e., mortality, new entrant intake, and interest (net of salary escalation). Each deterministic output of the valuation is thus supplemented with a confidence interval, that is, a range with an attached probability. The treatment covers the premiums under the different possible financial systems for these schemes, which differ from the funding methods of private pensions, as well as the testing of the level of the Fund ratio when the future contributions schedule is pre-determined. Although it is based on a relatively simplified approach and refers only to retirement pensions, with full adjustment in line with salary escalation, the paper brings out the stochastic features of pension scheme projections and illustrates a comprehensive stochastic valuation. It is hoped that the paper will stimulate interest in further research, both of a theoretical and a practical nature, and lead to progressively increasing recourse to stochastic methods in social <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> valuation...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Rehabilitation {{following}} {{medical conditions}} is largely offered as in-patient service in Germany. Foreign-national residents use rehabilitative services {{less often than}} Germans and attain less favourable treatment outcomes. These differences are independent of demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics. Satisfaction with different aspects of rehabilitative care presumably affects the effectiveness of rehabilitative services. We compared the degree of satisfaction with different domains of the rehabilitative care process between Germans and non-German nationals residing in Germany. Methods We used data from a cross-sectional rehabilitation patient survey annually conducted by the German Statutory <b>Pension</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme.</b> The sample comprises 274 [*] 513 individuals undergoing medical rehabilitation in 642 hospitals during the years 2007 – 2011. Participants rated their satisfaction with different domains of rehabilitation on multi-item scales. We dichotomised each scale to low/moderate and high satisfaction. For each domain, a multilevel adjusted logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine differences in the levels of satisfaction between German and non-German nationals. Average marginal effects (AMEs) and 99. 5 % CI were computed as effect estimates. AMEs represent differences in the probability for the occurrence of the outcome. Results Turkish nationals had a higher probability for being less satisfied with most aspects of their rehabilitation, with AMEs ranging between 0. 05 (99. 5 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 09) for ‘satisfaction with psychological care’ and 0. 11 (99. 5 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 14) for ‘satisfaction with treatments during rehabilitation’. Patients from former Yugoslavia and from Portugal/Spain/Italy/Greece were as satisfied as Germans with most aspects of their rehabilitation. Conclusions Turkish nationals are less satisfied with their rehabilitative care than other population groups. This may be attributable to {{the diversity of the}} population in terms of its expectations towards rehabilitation. Rehabilitative care institutions need to provide services that are sensitive to the needs of all clients. Diversity management can contribute to this process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Germany, the {{proportion}} of foreign national residents receiving an invalidity pension is {{higher than that of}} Germans. Lower utilization and effectiveness of medical rehabilitation are presumed to be the main reasons. We aimed to examine whether differences in utilization and effectiveness of medical rehabilitation between Germans and foreign nationals are attributable to differences in socio-demography, socio-economic background and health status. Utilization of rehabilitation was analyzed for household members aged 18  years or above enrolled in the German Socio-Economic Panel in 2002 - 2004 ( =  19, 521). Effectiveness of rehabilitation was defined by the occupational performance at the end of rehabilitation. It was examined by using an 80 % random sample of all completed medical rehabilitations in the year 2006 funded by the German Statutory <b>Pension</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> ( =  634, 529). Our study shows that foreign nationals utilize medical rehabilitation less often than Germans (OR =  0. 68; 95 %-CI =  0. 50; 0. 91). For those who do, medical rehabilitation is less effective (OR for low occupational performance =  1. 50; 95 %-CI =  1. 46; 1. 55). Both findings are only partially attributable to socio-demographic, socio-economic and health characteristics: After adjusting for these factors, ORs for utilization and low occupational performance were 0. 66 (95 %-CI =  0. 49; 0. 90) and 1. 20 (95 %-CI =  1. 16; 1. 24), respectively. It can be concluded that differences in the utilization and effectiveness of medical rehabilitation between Germans and foreign nationals cannot be explained only by socio-economic differences or poorer health before rehabilitation. In addition, factors such as the ability of the rehabilitative care system to accommodate clients with differing expectations, and migrant-specific characteristics such as cultural differences, seem to play a role...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the rehabilitation process of drug addicts there are many possibilities to introduce and implement occupational rehabilitation measures early on. The literature available on this subject, however, gives the impression that these opportunities have been too rarely used so far. This is essentially put down to the treatment concept, which is organised pre-dominantly according to medical and psychological factors, the insufficient sensitisation of the parties involved concerning the clients' occupation-related requirements and possibilities, as well as poor co-operation between therapists and benefit providers (in particular pension insurance and labour administration), which in turn are caused by the institutional and legal distinction between medical and occupational rehabilitation. The major fault found in connection with this is the insufficient occupational promotion of unemployed drug addicts who have undergone or are undergoing psychiatric treatment. The information available signalises that occupational promotion measures are implemented relatively seldom for individuals with addictions. Furthermore it is clear that data on the number of or the success of the activities in question is not available to a sufficient degree either in quantitative or qualitative terms for them to be assessed adequately. Owing to the immense damage to the economy that can occur as a result of rehabilitation for drug addicts not being implemented at all, or being implemented too late or insufficiently, the monitoring of efforts towards occupational rehabilitation seem, however, to be particularly pressing even if {{it is likely to be}} linked with considerable difficulties in the documentation and evaluation of the measures because of the multitude of potential activities and participants. Against the background of this there is a plea for the scientifically supported evaluation research to be expanded to cover the occupational rehabilitation of drug addicts. Aprecondition for this is, however, improved access to information on the various activities made available by benefit providers and those providing the services in this field. This data should then preferably be evaluated by neutral third parties - and not predominantly by the rehabilitation establishments, as has been the case so far; in this way it should be possible to obtain reliable statements on the quality of the measures with regard to structure, process and results. Possible starting points would be quality assurance systems such as those introduced recently in the field of medical rehabilitation of the compulsory <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> " (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Suchtkranke, berufliche Rehabilitation - Erfolgskontrolle, berufliche Reintegration - Förderung...|$|E
40|$|This study {{occupies}} {{itself with}} legal aspects of invalidity from youth. It represents {{an issue that}} is very significant from the social point of view although not regulated as single problem by law. However the whole theme infiltrates to another specific fields: social insurance, assessment medicine, psychology, juristic section, medicinal issue, ethics, upbringing and special pedagogy in a broad meaning. Current Czech law regulation of theme concerning benefits for persons with long-term unfavorable health state is based on concept of full and partial invalidity pension as benefits within <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> and pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Generally full and partial invalidity pension benefits originate from reduction of gainful activity and reaching of relevant time period of pension insurance. According to a survey it is evident that number of awarded full and partial invalidity pensions has increased in Jihočeský" region. Respecting diagnostic flags structure the greatest occurrence of full invalidity pensions from youth has been recorded in group of intermediate cephalonia. Solving of social insurance of the elderly is planned under the pension reform at the present. The main goal of invalidity pension is permission to live {{as close as possible to}} normal state thus to face up to a handicap and to secure appropriate family, social and work life. In fine we could deduce that there should be confirmation of obligatory conversion of full invalidity pension to old-age pension when reaching retirement age within Czech pension reform. In my study I have focused on some factors decisive for occurrence of full or partial invalidity. It represents socially significant problems in broad range of relations that establish or could establish. Long-term loss or reduction of ability to work have negative impact not only on individuals but also affect social status of their families and thus negatively influence the whole society. Exclusion from work process traumatizes young people. Pension benefits provided to the disabled from youth are not deduced from tolled premiums. That is the reason I think this should be solved out of the pension insurance system as well as pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Costs on these benefits would be compensated by state budget within pension insurance system in the near future with perspective of transmission of these benefits to other social scheme. In this connection it is necessary to emphasize that mankind should be made sure that there is basic perception and crucial aim of social welfare in focusing on level and quality of life of individuals and their families not affected by unfavorable social or economic influences as well as their health state and well-being that will not be compounded by diseases and injuries.

40|$|The Austrian Federal {{government}} is striving {{to achieve a}} balanced national budget for 2002. In terms of budgetary distribution, {{it is assumed that}} the Länder (Federal states) will deliver a surplus of 0. 75 percent of GDP, whereas the communities will arrive at a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Federal budget could then have a deficit margin of 0. 75 percent of GDP. The budget proposed for 2002 meets this stability target. Current economic prospects, however, will not help to achieve the objective of a balanced budget. The Federal government attempts to meet its budgetary goal by raising additional (tax) revenues and by instituting savings on the expenditure side. Compared to 2000, the one-time effects on the revenue side of the 2002 budget are markedly lower, {{while at the same time}} the overall tax ratio is rising. Apart from ATS 1 billion, all of the additional revenues from taxation, which are estimated at about ATS 28 billion, will flow into Federal budget. At the same time, the Länder have raised their consolidation contribution to the Federal budget from ATS 2. 29 billion (from 2001) to ATS 4. 29 billion. Federal expenditures show substantial shifts due to budget consolidation. Altogether, both personnel expenses and transfers in the 2002 budget follow the original targets. The preliminary result for 2000 indicates that objectives were met, so that a solid foundation was built for the budgets for 2001 and 2002. The 2002 budget makes it clear that Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft is now investing a substantial part of the funds for construction and buildings which were formerly invested directly under the Federal budget. As a consequence, construction investment is noticeably lower in the Federal budget (at € 197 million in 2002, it is posted at more than 40 percent below the 2000 figure), whereas expenditure on rents has risen by almost € 400 million between 2000 and 2002. Other expenditure items similarly illustrate that the Federal {{government is}} increasingly outsourcing works and services to third parties rather than rendering them directly. Transfer payments are mostly within the scope of social expenditure. More than half of these payments are made to cover old-age pensions. At ATS 177. 3 billion (€ 12. 9 billion) in 2002, they will be 8. 2 percent higher than in 2000. The greater part of this sum is used as Federal contribution to the statutory <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> (including equalisation payments) and transfers to the equalisation funds held by the pension insurance institutions. Apart from covering old-age pensions, a substantial share of the transfer payments involves family subsidies. The new child-care benefit (payable as of 2002) will make for a considerable increase of this item. Taking into account the abolishing of the parental leave benefit, the new child-care benefit will call for another ATS 6. 4 billion (€ 0. 46 billion) by 2002. Two components on the expenditure side will make an important contribution to budget consolidation: interest on the national debt and transfer payments to other public bodies. Lower budget deficits will make for interest payments in 2002 at roughly the 2001 level. Payments to other territorial authorities and funds are budgeted at ATS 113. 4 billion in 2002 (compared to ATS 113. 2 billion in 2000), as a consequence of the Federal government's attempt to reduce its financing functions.

This paper also suggests that policies to strengthen the public finances and improve product and labor market performance are needed {{to lay the groundwork}} for Greece to follow the Irish path of high and sustained real-income growth.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors {{predicting}} which employees receive employer-funded commercial <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> contributions in Shanghai's zhenbao (town insurance) program, introduced by the Shanghai Government in 2003. Design/methodology/approach – A series of hypotheses are developed to examine whether employees with characteristics that make them more influential constituencies will be more likely to receive voluntary commercial <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> contributions. The hypotheses are tested through application of a ReLogit model to data on 103, 095 employees enrolled in the town <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> in one district as at the end of 2004. Findings – The study finds that only a small proportion of individuals in the sample receive commercial <b>pension</b> <b>insurance.</b> The most important determinant of whether an employee received commercial <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> is his or her level of education. Research limitations/implications – The study provides support for the societal corporatist perspective that employers who place a premium on human capital and invest significant resources in the skills of their workers will favor social policies that target benefits to a selected group of workers to reward their performance and foster commitment. A limitation of the research is that it is based on data collected soon after the town <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> was introduced. The low level of employee coverage may improve once employers become more familiar with the operation of the scheme. Practical implications – Employers should consider social insurance as a labor market strategy to retain staff and enhance the human resource base of the firm. Originality/value – Little attention has been given to the role of employer-funded social insurance within the ambit of labor market strategies designed to enhance the human resource base of the organisation. This is the first study to use micro level data to examine the determinants of voluntary employer contributions to social insurance.

40|$|The Federal {{government}} attained {{the goal}} of budget consolidation in 1997. The net deficit declined to 2. 6 percent of GDP. The other territorial authorities have also exceeded their goals. Thus, the general government deficit totaled only 2. 5 percent of GDP, and Austria has easily met the budget deficit criterion {{for participation in the}} European Economic and Monetary Union. Fiscal restraint, however, does not only serve to meet the "Maastricht criteria", but also to gain maneuvering room for fiscal policy in the medium term. More than half of the reduction in the deficit during the years 1996 - 97 was achieved by savings on the expenditure side. Tax measures also contributed to the reduction in the deficit. The 1999 draft budget is set to stabilize the deficit ratio. The favorable development must not be jeopardized, however, by additional claims on the Federal budget, a caveat that is also necessary in view of the EU Stability Pact. The outlay structure has undergone significant shifts. This {{can be traced to the}} establishment of new public sector entities (railroads, Post Office, Federal real estate agency) as well as new modes of financing public investment (leasing). The result is a shift in infrastructure investment from the public to the private sector. An important task of the Federal government remains the financing of pensions. About 20 percent of total expenditures are allocated to this item. In addition to funding the pensions to Federal civil servants (including those in the railroad system and the postal service), the Federal government contributes large amounts to the <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> Despite various reform measures, the Federal contributions are set to rise to ATS 59. 6 billion in 1999, from ATS 57. 5 billion in 1997. An important component of Federal social expenditures is assistance to families. Family allowances are scheduled to be raised in 1999 (in addition, income tax deductions for children will be increased). These measures will require additional funds of ATS 3 billion. Reductions in tax revenues also amount to ATS 3 billion; in sum, additional funds allocated to family assistance will total ATS 6 billion in 1999. More funds are budgeted for active labor market policies, especially within the framework of the National Action Plan. In 1999, ATS 3 billion are allocated to these programs. Within the support programs for the manufacturing and small business sectors, the emphasis is shifting from the traditional measures (such as subsidized loans) to measures fostering technological innovation. Moreover, regional programs, some of which are co-financed by the EU, are also gaining in importance. The most important source of revenue of the Federal budget are taxes, which cover about two thirds of expenditures. As a result of various measures, tax revenues rose substantially in 1996 - 97. In 1997, the tax ratio reached a record high. It is expected to decline slightly in 1998 - 99, as a result of the termination of one-off effects and new provisions regarding the taxation of families with dependents. Revenues from the value-added tax and other excise taxes are expected to rise slowly, with a rate of growth below that of GDP. In 1997, receipts from privatization totaled ATS 17. 2 billion, constituting an important source of revenue. For 1999, privatization receipts are budgeted considerably lower, at ATS 3 billion. The 1997 budget deficit was financed entirely in the form of schilling debts. As a result, the share of debt denominated in foreign currencies in the total Federal debt fell from 21. 2 percent in 1996 to 20. 7 percent in 1997.

40|$|Social {{insurance}} originally {{started as}} a system {{for the protection of}} the employed and gradually expanded to include the self-employed and rural population. In Japan a nation-wide coverage of medical care and <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> for all was attained in 1961. Since then，the social <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> have grown as more and more people have become employees throughout the period of economic growth. But lately the tendency has reversed and many female adults came to join the labor market as low-paid part- timer workers. As they try to maintain the status of dependant of their husbands' <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> by managing their income below the threshold，they do not contribute to the cost of social insurance. The aim of the paper is to show that a standard contribution principle can be applied to employees as well as the self-employed and to present a fair mechanism for allocating resources to all the schemes，according to the standard benefit cost of each.

40|$|The public {{pension system}} in Austria redistributes 15 {{percent of the}} gross {{domestic}} product within a pay-as-you-go-system to retirees. The extent of money transfers is not only determined by the systems gradual maturity but also by exogenous factors like demographic change, more volatile job relations and adjusting participation rates of the labour force. In a pay-as-you-go-system this generates financial pressure and finally shifts the redistribution pattern between generations. Austria's pension system is income based and designed to protect the retiree's living standard. Early pension reforms until the mid 1980 's concentrated on increasing contribution rates. Negative labour market effects from high wedges between net and gross wages forced more recent reforms to stress actuarial measures, thereby redesigning the systems towards a more contribution based system. The main group at which financial cuts were targeted are future retirees. This is in line with international experience on pension reforms. The pension reform of 1997 harmonised the increments used to calculate new pensions at 2 percent for each insurance year. The maximum retirement pension (80 percent of the basis of assessment) can thus be obtained after 40 insurance years. At the same time, a system of actuarial discounts was introduced as a first attempt to raise the retirement age: each year of retirement before the regular retirement age (60 for women, 65 for men) makes for a reduction of 2 percent from the base of assessment. The reduction was capped in order to avoid hardships. Both reforms entered into force at the start of 2000, thereby strengthening the insurance principle of the retirement pension. As a further incentive to retire later, the period for calculating the basis of assessment for early retirement will be gradually extended to 18 years, starting in 2003. The transition phase will not be completed until 2020. The delayed effectiveness of the 1997 reform means that it does not yet have any visible financial effect on the federal contribution to the <b>pension</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Actually, the actuarial discounts currently produce a counter-incentive, speeding up early retirement. The retirement age for direct pensions nevertheless did not vary much over the past years. Average figures thus do not show a rush towards early retirement. The pension reform 2000 is characterised by budgetary consolidation efforts of the federal government. The financially most important part reduces the attractiveness of early retirement schemes by raising the discount to 3 percent per year and the minimum age for early retirement to 56 ½ and 61 ½ years, respectively. By relying on more rigorous admission criteria the government makes shure to achieve financial targets at the cost of formulating actuarial correct discounts and by restricting the possibility of individual choice with respect to the retirement age.
