50|$|Some European- and Asian-manufactured {{military}} and sporting ammunition uses Berdan primers. Removing the spent primer from (decapping) these cases requires {{use of a}} special tool because the <b>primer</b> <b>anvil</b> (on which the primer compound is crushed) {{is an integral part}} of the case and the case therefore does not have a central hole through which a decapping tool can push the primer out from the inside, as is done with Boxer primers. In Berdan cases, the flash holes are located to the sides of the anvil. With the right tool and components, reloading Berdan-primed cases is perfectly feasible. However, Berdan primers are not readily available in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Boxer primers {{are similar}} to Berdan primers with one major difference: the {{location}} of the anvil. In a Boxer primer, the anvil is a separate stirrup piece that sits inverted in the primer cup providing sufficient resistance to the impact of the firing pin as it indents the cup and crushes the pressure-sensitive ignition compound. The primer pocket in the case head has a single flash-hole in its center. This positioning makes little or no difference to the performance of the round, but it makes fired primers vastly easier to remove for re-loading, as a single, centered rod pushed through the flash hole from the open end of the case will eject the two-piece primer from the primer cup. A new <b>primer,</b> <b>anvil</b> included, is then pressed into the case using a reloading press or hand-tool. Boxer priming is universal for US-manufactured civilian factory ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|Since its introduction, the M855A1 {{has been}} criticized for its St. Mark’s SMP842 {{propellant}} causing increased fouling of the gun barrel. Post-combat surveys have reported no issues with the EPR in combat. A series of tests found no significant difference in fouling between the old M855 and the M855A1. However, manufacturers have reported [...] "severe degradation" [...] to barrels of their rifles using the M855A1 in tests. The Army attributes pressure and wear issues with the M855A1 to problems with the primer, which they claim to have addressed with a newly designed primer. It uses a modified four-pronged <b>primer</b> <b>anvil</b> for more reliable powder ignition, with a stab crimp rather than a circumferential crimp to better withstand the new load’s higher chamber pressure, increased from [...] to [...] During Army carbine testing, the round caused [...] "accelerated bolt wear" [...] from higher chamber pressure and increased bore temperatures. Special Operator testing saw cracks appear on locking lugs and bolts at cam pin holes on average at 6,000 rounds, but sometimes as few as 3,000 rounds during intense automatic firing. Firing several thousand rounds with such high chamber pressures can lead to degraded accuracy over time as parts wear out; these effects can be mitigated through a round counter to keep track of part service life. Weapons with barrel lengths shorter than the M4 firing the M855A1 also experience 50 percent higher pressures than a full-length M16 rifle barrel, which can cause port erosion that can boost the automatic fire rate, increasing the likelihood of jams.|$|E
50|$|Factory {{ammunition}} {{was produced}} by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and <b>primer</b> has <b>anvil),</b> others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole cartridge and <b>primer</b> has no <b>anvil).</b> Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan primer. Berden primed cartridges also have a double flash hole, making their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin.|$|R

5000|$|All modern shotgun shells (excluding {{specialized}} rimfire [...]22 [...] "snake loads" [...] or birdshot cartridges) are centerfire. They use a large, specific shotgun primer that {{is based}} on the Boxer system, in that the <b>primer</b> contains the <b>anvil</b> against which the primary explosive is compressed by the firing pin and deformation of the primer cup.|$|R
5000|$|Berdan primers {{are named}} after their American inventor, Hiram Berdan of New York who invented his first {{variation}} of the Berdan primer and patented it on March 20, 1866, in [...] A small copper cylinder formed the shell of the cartridge, and the primer cap was pressed into a recess in {{the outside of the}} closed end of the cartridge opposite the bullet. In the end of the cartridge beneath the primer cap was a small vent-hole, as well as a small teat-like projection or point (later to be known as an anvil) fashioned from the case, such that the firing pin could crush the <b>primer</b> against the <b>anvil</b> and ignite the propellant. This system worked well, allowing the option of installing a cap just before use of the propellant-loaded cartridge as well as permitting reloading the cartridge for reuse.|$|R
