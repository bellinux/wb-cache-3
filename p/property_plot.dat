Most property is 1930s-1960s semi-detached or detached houses with gardens on verge or tree-lined roads. The railway here benefits from seating at peak times but gives lower speed {{of access to}} the City of London relative to the South West Main Line developments of Elmbridge. Wide roads and parking provide strengths of the borough. The largest plots of garden measure only around an acre not covering any of the grassy plain, western outlying farms or boundary-lining trees in the far east and west. Lower Sunbury has numerous pubs, independent restaurants. A dog-free meadow permitting informal cricket and football is near the main parade of shops at which annual carols are held and at the regatta time in August a celebratory street market takes place.|$|E

One of the roads of the intersection extends into the extreme background at center. Along {{the sides of the}} road, lines of automobiles can be seen. Several automobiles are also visible traveling along the street, as well as a large railcar. To the far left, a large rectangular building surrounded by a line of automobiles can be seen. Three arched entryways line the base of the building, while small windows cover the facade. Small decorations can be seen along many of the windows. In the background at left, a large plot of empty land has been marked off and labeled "A". Similarly, a section of buildings to the right has been labeled "B".

40|$|This paper mainly {{uses the}} method of Urban Morphology to study the {{transformation}} process of urban form of Xiguan historical district in Guangzhou, P. R. China. The paper tries to analyze the transformation process through studying the background of politics, economy, society, culture and natural condition of Xiguan area. It further discusses the structural feature and transformation rule, as well as analyzes the hidden dynamics. Considering time as the main factor, the paper mainly focuses on two aspects—form elements and dynamics, trying to study the relation between each other. The paper aims at concluding the overall transformation feature and rule of Xiguan area and bringing up some perspectives on the protection and continuity of traditional urban fabric and culture {{in the process of}} urban renewal. The body of this paper is organized through tracing the transformation of urban form in different periods of time. First, to study the foundation of form transformation through demonstrating the construction background of Xiguan area before Qing Dynasty; Second, to discuss separately the form feature of Qing Dynasty, the period of the Republic of China and the period after the foundation of New China. The form feature is mainly analyzed in several aspects as the street feature, <b>property</b> <b>plot,</b> building type, land use and street space; Finally, to summarize the transformation rule on the basis of overall analysis of transformation feature of Xiguan area, and then to conclude the main dynamics of form transformation, as well as to discuss the practical significance for the protection of Xiguan historical district and urban renewal.

30|$|This {{article is}} {{composed}} as follows. In Section “TG-QHR distribution”, TG-QHR distribution is introduced. In Section “Structural properties of TG-QHR distribution”, TG-QHR distribution is studied {{in terms of}} various structural <b>properties,</b> <b>plots,</b> sub-models and descriptive measures {{on the basis of}} quantiles. In Section “Moments and inequality measures”, moments, incomplete moments, residual life functions and inequality measures and some other properties are theoretically derived. In Section “Characterizations”, TG-QHR distribution is characterized via (i) ratio of truncated moments; (ii) hazard function; (iii) reverse hazard rate function and (iv) elasticity function. In Section “Maximum likelihood estimation”, estimates of the parameters of TG-QHR distribution are obtained via maximum likelihood method. In Section “Simulation studies”, simulation studies are performed on the basis of graphical results to illustrate the performance of MLEs. In Section “Applications”, the significance and flexibility of TG-QHR distribution is tested through different measures by application to two real data sets. Goodness of fit of TG-QHR distribution is checked via different methods. Conclusion is given in Section “Conclusions”.|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a marked rise in middle Anglo-Saxon settlement research, as archaeologists have become increasingly aware {{of the way in}} which this transformative period in English history can be recognised through habitation sites. Though a period during which individuals and institutions seemingly wielded unprecedented new power, archaeologists have struggled to identify many of the processes or ‘motors’ by which such authority was articulated in the landscape. This paper concerns itself with understanding one such driver, demonstrating how early medieval kings shifted power from tribute-orientated regimes to ones rooted in agricultural exploitation. The Church was fundamental to this shift in authority, and was used as a means of consolidating new power relations. In order to sustain more permanent clerical communities, the Church developed core agricultural areas surrounding their centres, known as inland, upon which were established early types of ‘home farm’. In addition to their functional purpose middle Anglo-Saxon ‘home farms’ were subject to exceptionally high degrees of spatial ordering. Such definition of settlement space, which now included <b>property</b> <b>plots</b> and houses defined by boundaries of unprecedented permanence, allowed elites to shape and consolidate perceptions of social order in the landscape. Power was now being materialised, not only through agricultural production but also through the lived experience of rural communities, as a social hierarchy which considered the place of kings as divinely appointed became firmly established...|$|R
