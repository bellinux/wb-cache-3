The name had techie cachet in its day (Piet Zwart's NKF kabel catalogue of 1927 is well-known) and is primarily metaphorical and allusive, a pun referring to both the monolinear construction of the face, {{and the role of}} type as a means of communication.|$|R

5000|$|As an {{engineer}} at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise ("Johnson-Nyquist noise"), {{the stability of}} feedback amplifiers, <b>telegraphy,</b> <b>facsimile,</b> television, and other important communications problems. With Herbert E. Ives, he helped to develop AT&T's first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classic paper on stability of feedback amplifiers. [...] The Nyquist stability criterion can now be found in all textbooks on feedback control theory.|$|R

In particular they discuss conferencing from studios and work-places, system variants (such as sound conferencing, and picture conferencing with still and with moving pictures), and terminals for conferencing (using telephones, sound, <b>picture</b> and <b>facsimile).</b> They give examples of work-place systems for sending documents and personal data...|$|R

The first satellite, ARABSAT- 1 A, has already been launched in a geostationary orbit and placed at 19 degree East longitude. The second in this series will be located around 26 degree East longitude, while the third will be stored in the ground. One of the two satellites in orbit will act as a standby, but {{may be used to}} provide additional services if required. Each of the two satellites in orbit can provide services such as telephony, telex, data transmission, <b>telegraphy,</b> <b>facsimile,</b> radio and television broadcasting. This satellite system will provide educational broadcasting, video teleconferencing and emergency communicationsIEEE, New York, NY, US...|$|R
40|$|Amateur Radio {{service is}} defined as a radio {{communications}} service (covering both terrestrial and satellite) in which a station is used for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, by duly authorized persons who are interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without any pecuniary interest [4][7]. Amateur radio, often called ham radio, is both a hobby and a service that uses various types of radio communications equipment to communicate with other radio amateurs for public service, recreation and self-training. A participant is called an amateur radio operator, or a ham [2]. No one knows for sure why amateur radio operators are called hams; the original meaning has been lost over the years. Many theories exist as to the meaning of "ham", but nothing concrete. Amateur radio operators have been around since the beginning of radio, but the Amateur Radio Service did not come along until the advent of a licensing body. Amateur radio operators enjoy personal wireless communications with each other and are able to support their communities with emergency and disaster communications if necessary, while increasing their personal knowledge of electronics and radio theory. An estimated six million people throughout the world are regularly involved with amateur radio [3]. Millions of amateur radio operators communicate daily with each other directly or through ad hoc relay systems and amateur satellites [7]. Amateur radio operators have traditionally been recognized as {{an important part of the}} radio community and several frequency bands throughout the whole spectrum are allocated by ITU to this service internationally as well as in our Spectrum Plan [7]. With regard to the spectrum use, all frequencies are shared or common to all amateur radio operators and no frequency is assigned for the exclusive use of any amateur station. Amateur radio operators cooperate in selecting transmitting channels to make the most effective use of the allocated frequencies. Amateurs do not broadcast their transmissions; they have two-way communications with other amateurs. In fact, it is illegal for amateurs to broadcast information for the general public on the amateur radio bands or communicate with non-amateurs. Activities that amateurs radio operators can do with their radios are diverse. The following list stated examples of their activities. •Communicate around the world. •Converse around town with small portable VHF and UHF transceivers. •Help in emergencies and natural disasters situations •Build theirs own radios, transmitter, receiver and antennas. •Communicate through orbiting satellites. •Communicate with astronaut while orbiting the earth. •Experimental with amateurs TV (ATV), Slow-Scan TV (SSTV), or send still-frame <b>pictures</b> by <b>facsimile.</b> •Participate in transmitter hunt games or maybe build your own directional finding equipment. •Participate in the activity of communication required for search and rescue activities...|$|R
