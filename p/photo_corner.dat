5000|$|Basic {{materials}} include {{background papers}} (including printed and cardstock paper), <b>photo</b> <b>corner</b> mounts (or {{other means of}} mounting photos such as adhesive dots, photo mounting tape, or acid-free glue), scissors, a paper trimmer or cutting tool, art pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like thermo-tac). More elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, rubber stamps, craft punches, stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing tools and personal die cut machines. A lot of time people who enjoy scrapbooking will create their own background papers by using the tools mentioned along with [...] "fancy" [...] textured scissors.|$|E
5000|$|Unbound materials, usually single-sheet items, {{need to be}} {{attached}} securely to the mounts, unless matted or encapsulated. Metal fasteners, pins, screws, and thumbtacks should not come {{in direct contact with}} any exhibit items. [...] Instead, <b>photo</b> <b>corners,</b> polyethylene, or polyester film straps may hold the object to the support. Objects may also be encapsulated in polyester film, though old and untreated acidic papers should be professionally deacidified before encapsulation. Avoid potential slippage during encapsulation - when possible, use ultrasonic or heat seals. For objects that need to be hung (and that may require more protection than lightweight polyester film), matting would be an effective alternative.|$|R

5000|$|Another major {{function}} of the mat in archival framing (where the mats used are made of acid-free and lignin-free paper) comes into play during the mounting process. In archival framing, paper items are not typically glued down to the backing, as it prevents anyone in the future {{from being able to}} safely and easily remove it to replace damaged frames, backing or mats, and can make restoration of a damaged document or art piece more difficult. Typically, such items are instead held in place against the backing with mylar [...] "photo corners" [...] (tiny triangular pockets into which the corners of the paper are put). The added (though slight) weight of mats can help hold a piece in place while also helping to hide the backing and <b>photo</b> <b>corners.</b> In archival framing, the mats are not glued to the piece or backing, but are [...] "hinged" [...] to the backing with tape, though if more than one mat is used, the mats are typically glued to each other.|$|R

40|$|Artists making books {{often use}} {{photography}} {{as a means}} of recording a narrative of places or their travels, but what if they are documenting something that isn’t actually there at all? A few examples of the artists who inspired me to do the talk are: Scott McCarney (USA) publishes many books in his biography / autobiography series. As we get older, the more we forget, and for McCarney, the more things he accumulates in recompense. His 2007 edition Photographs, is an empty book, a reproduction of an early 20 th Century photography album with text annotations and <b>photo</b> <b>corners</b> with the pictures removed. Dedicated to anyone’s lost family histories. Kurt Johannessen (Norway) photographed flying rocks for his book flygande steinar. Frans Baake (The Netherlands) travels to islands around the world, to gather photographs for his books. But he cannot always access the land, some are private islands, some impossible to reach, so, in 2004 he produced Never Been There, a collection of islands photographed from nearby or from a distance. As he says, the artist has been to the specific regions in order to say that he hasn’t been there: Wow, how many places he didn’t visit!' In my own Flowers in Hotel Rooms series, these small photographic books document my actions in tribute to characters in novels I am reading, but these aren’t real events. They involve an impromptu stage set and camera, depending on what I am reading and what I can find to quickly produce a postcard-sized image in a hotel room. Dinner and a Rose was a collaboration with the poet Nancy Campbell, in tribute to Patricia Highsmith's Ripley quartet. This included hosting a one-day dinner party for invited guests, at which the meals and drinks mentioned in the books were served. Ripley is neither seen or referred to in the book or the video. TOAST: A Night on Weevil Lake, a collaborative book and video produced on World Book Night, Saturday 5 th March 2011. A tribute to Douglas Coupland's novel The Gum Thief, which consisted of an evening of nothing being cooked, no hosting and Chinese food having to be ordered in and eaten off of paper plates from Staples. And finally, No Dutch Details, Tom Sowden and Sarah Bodman, January 2011. A video-book tribute to Ed Ruscha’s Dutch Details produced whilst travelling. Produced on an intercity train from Amsterdam Schiphol to Enschede, The Netherlands between 19. 47 and 20. 00 on Sunday 16 th January 2011. The film recreates the zoom-in image format of Ruscha’s Dutch Details, as a chronological tribute to of all his books published between 1963 and 1978, but using only props found or created in miniature that could be photographed on the train. The film, of course fails to produce a faithful reproduction of any of Ruscha’s books, as the end titles indicate...|$|R

5000|$|A serious policy dispute emerged, however, {{when the}} President {{announced}} in July that the nation's largely untapped oil resources {{would be open}} to foreign exploration via contracts to be signed with the state oil concern, YPF. This was a reversal of a policy adopted by Frondizi with his 1954 treatise, Petróleo y Política, as well as during the campaign, and elicited strong opposition from Gómez. The dispute, though not public at its outset, became the subject of an ongoing series by the satirical news magazine, Tía Vicenta, after its editor, Juan Carlos Colombres, learned of a series of meetings Gómez held with Admiral Isaac Rojas, General Domingo Quaranta (Director of State Intelligence), and others. The periodical referred to the controversy for five months with a <b>corner</b> <b>photo</b> of Gómez in an insert beside an epigraph asking: ¿A mi por que me miran? ("Why are you all looking at me?").|$|R
5000|$|One of its {{recurring}} topics was {{the ban on}} Peronism, {{which its}} editorials referred to often and in violation of Decree Law 4161/56 (the decree, signed by President Pedro Aramburu in 1956, prohibited any mention of or references to exiled populist leader Juan Perón or Peronism). Another political controversy whose coverage made Tía Vicenta memorable was the dispute between President Arturo Frondizi and Vice President Alejandro Gómez regarding Frondizi's decision in 1958 to open the nation's oil fields to foreign exploration (a reversal of Frondizi's earlier stance). The Vice President had not made his opposition to this policy in public. The covers of Tía Vicenta, however, appeared {{for a number of}} weeks with a <b>corner</b> <b>photo</b> of Gómez in a circular insert with an epigraph asking: ¿A mi por qué me miran? ("Why are you looking at me?"). Gómez was forced to resign by the President in November, merely six months after their swearing in.|$|R
5000|$|Romanesque Revival {{architecture}} {{was very}} popular in Hartford City, and at least 7 of the District's contributing buildings were built using this style. [...] This style of architecture is known for round arches {{in many of the}} openings. [...] Smooth surfaces, sometimes with belt courses are also typical. A variation of the Romanesque Revival architectural style known as Richardsonian Romanesque was popular in America {{near the end of the}} 19th century, when much of the construction around Hartford City's courthouse took place. [...] The courthouse and Presbyterian Church are outstanding examples of Henry Hobson Richardson's variation in Romanesque Revival style. [...] (See <b>photos</b> herein.) A <b>corner</b> tower, arched windows, recessed entrances, steeply pitched roofs, and multiple exterior textures (rustication) are typical of this style of architecture. [...] The Richardsonian Romanesque buildings differ from the original Romanesque Revival buildings by having rough-textured exterior surfaces instead of all-smooth surfaces. [...] The Hotel Ingram, Kirshbaum, and Weiler buildings were built in Romanesque Revival style with arched windows and multiple exterior textures, but they were not identified in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form as Richardsonian (see photos of all three buildings herein.) ...|$|R
