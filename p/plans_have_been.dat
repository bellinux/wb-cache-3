5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{rejected}} by the company. Such a center section would be low-floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made for new trams to be ordered.|$|E
5|$|As a result, <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{made for}} a major urban {{extension}} in the town, mainly {{to the east of}} the railway station.

5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E

5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport.

5|$|Because of {{atypical}} scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has {{a controversial}} season number discrepancy {{in which many}} are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between American Dad! creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker hinted that an American Dad! movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written.

5|$|Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall {{stations}} were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 {{by members of}} the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no longer has a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} the conflict, and after the war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} in 1972, Highway427 follows {{what was}} originally a two lane roadway known as Highway27, {{as well as}} a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway7 over the following twenty years. A short arterial extension was later built, though this section is designated as York Regional Road99 (Zenway Boulevard). <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> announced to extend Highway427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive; construction will begin in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.|$|E

5|$|Lerkendal opened as a {{multi-purpose}} stadium on 10 August 1947, as {{the main}} football and athletics stadium in Trondheim. Originally the venue was mostly used by the football teams SK Freidig and FK Kvik, and Rosenborg did not became a tenant until 1957. A new grandstand with roof was completed in 1962, and floodlights were installed in 1968. The oldest of the current stands were built in 1996, along with new lighting. Three more grandstands were built between 2000 and 2002, which also saw {{the removal of the}} athletics facilities and the sale of the stadium from Trondheim Municipality to Rosenborg. Further expansions <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> launched, to increase capacity by filling in the corners and possibly by building a retractable roof.|$|E
