25|$|Medical {{underwriting}} is {{a health}} insurance term {{referring to the}} use of medical or health information in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the underwriting process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more indepth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.|$|E

40|$|Federally subsidized crop {{insurance}} {{has a long}} history of underwriting losses. These losses may be due to <b>premium</b> <b>rating</b> procedures that do not account, as fully as possible, for differences in yield loss risk across farms. If farmers understand their own yield loss risk in more detail than is reflected in {{crop insurance}} <b>premium</b> <b>rates,</b> an information asymmetry may be leading to adverse selection or moral hazard. Regional differences in underwriting losses suggest that the effect of asymmetric information is relatively large where inter-farm yield variability is also relatively large. An econometric model is used to identify asymmetric information in crop insurance <b>premium</b> <b>rating.</b> A simulation model is used to compare existing crop insurance <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> to alternative rates calculated using yield loss risk measures based on existing, farm-specific yield history data. Both models are applied to crop/region combinations where inter-farm yield variability is relatively low (non-irrigated corn in the Corn Belt region) and where inter-farm yield variability is relatively high (non-irrigated, continuously cropped wheat in the Northern Plains). Region-wide asymmetric information effects are identified for both regions, but the asymmetric information effect is found to be larger in the high variability region. This difference explains at least part of the inter-regional difference in underwriting losses. The simulation analysis suggests that, on average, across an entire region, <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> derived from a farm-specific measure of yield variability are closer to actuarially fair <b>rates</b> than RMA <b>premium</b> <b>rates.</b> At a county- and farm-level, however, it is much more difficult to say, with a high level of statistical confidence, whether these alternate <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> are closer than RMA rates to the actuarially fair rates. To provide a foundation for the crop insurance models, an econometric model of crop yields is estimated and used to separate total yield variation into systematic and random components. Random yield variation is tested against several common distributions, including normal, gamma, and beta. The effect of aggregation on the representation of both systematic and random yield variation is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Retirement {{planning}} {{is a very}} important part of every middle-aged person’s life. Deferred whole life insurance and annuity contracts can be purchased by periodic payments during the deferment period and allows the contract holder to buy the protection they need before retirement. Special death benefits are often attached to such contracts which will increase <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> but also offer the contract holder protection during the deferment period. My project takes a look at <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> for both basic contracts and contracts that return premium payments with interest if death occurs in the deferment period. I have used male and female mortality tables from the Society of Actuaries website and I have used Microsoft Excel to calculate <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> and to display the premium calculations. I have also used smoker and non-smoker mortality tables to see how smoking affects <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> for individuals age: 20 - 50. My Excel project contains tables and graphs of <b>premium</b> <b>rates</b> for annuity and insurance contracts for males, females, smokers, and non-smokers in the United States. My results have shown that smokers should consider buying deferment protection if they start begin payments during their mid 30 s and plan on paying until their mid to late 50 s. Smoker mortality rates are noticeably higher around age 45 so smokers should either pay for extra protection or purchase basic contracts with shorter deferment periods. The most efficient option for average citizens is to start payments on a 10 - to 20 -year deferment contract around the age of 30...|$|R
