25|$|Although WCW tried all {{it could}} to {{alleviate}} the strain of debt in early 2001, the financial burdens proved too heavy to bear for the promotion and its new parent, AOL Time Warner. Once it gained the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> off WCW, AOL Time Warner looked to unload its financial albatross. A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff {{and a group of}} private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place. However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head Jamie Kellner formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from FOX and NBC.|$|E

Producer Deeley pursued De Niro for The Deer Hunter {{because he}} felt that he needed De Niro's star <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> a film with a [...] "gruesome-sounding storyline and a barely known director". [...] "I liked the script, and [...] had done a lot of prep," [...] said De Niro. [...] "I was impressed." [...] De Niro {{prepared}} by socializing with steelworkers in local bars and by visiting their homes. Cimino introduced De Niro as his agent, Harry Ufland. No one recognized him. De Niro claims this was his most physically exhausting film. He explained that the scene where Mike visits Steven in the hospital for the first time was the most emotional scene that he was ever involved with. De Niro was a last-minute replacement for Roy Scheider, who dropped out of the production two weeks before the start of filming due to [...] "creative differences"; Universal managed to keep Scheider to his three-picture contract by forcing him into doing Jaws 2 (1978).|$|E
2500|$|For {{businesses}} where {{floating charges}} were created before 2003, and in eight types of corporate insolvencies in the Insolvency Act 1986, sections 72B to 72GA, an older procedure of administrative receivership remains available. These companies are capital market investments; public-private partnerships with step in rights; utility projects; urban regeneration projects; large project finance with step in rights; financial market, system and collateral security charges; registered social landlords; and rail and water companies. Until the Enterprise Act 2002, creditors who had contracted for a security interest over a whole company could appoint their own representative to seize {{and take a}} company's assets, owing minimal duties to other creditors. Initially this was a right based purely in the common law of property. The Law of Property Act 1925 gave the holder of any mortgage an incidental <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the secured property once the power became exercisable. The receiver was appointable and removable only by, and was the sole the agent of, the mortgagee. In companies, secured lenders who had taken a floating charge over all the assets of a company also contracted for the right upon insolvency to manage the business: the appointed person was called a [...] "receiver and manager" [...] or an [...] "administrative receiver". The Insolvency Act 1986 amended the law so as to codify and raise the administrative receiver's duties. All receivers had a duty to keep and show accounts, and administrative receivers had to keep unsecured creditors informed, and file a report at Companies House. By default, he would be personally liable for contracts that he adopted while he ran the business. For employment contracts, he could not contract out of liability, and had to pay wages if he kept employees working for over 14 days. However, the administrative receiver could always be reimbursed for these costs out of the company's assets, {{and he would have}} virtually absolute management powers to control the company in the sole interest of the floating charge holder.|$|E

It is said that Peter, passing along the street one day, stopped to listen to Menzikoff as he was singing a song or telling a story to a crowd of listeners. He was much diverted by one of the songs that he heard, and at the close of it he spoke to the boy, and finally asked him what he would take for his whole stock of cakes and pies, basket and all. The boy named the sum for which he would sell all the cakes and pies, but as for the basket he said that belonged to his master, and he had no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it.|$|E

6000|$|... "But now {{everything}} is changed, {{and the change}} has taken place chiefly from one cause--namely, the disuse of money. At first, {{it was thought that}} some sort of circulating medium must be used, that life could not be transacted without it. But life began to go on perfectly well, when each dwelt in the place assigned him, which was no better and no worse than any other; and when, after he had given his three hours a day to the obligatory labors, he had a right to his share of food, light, heat, and raiment; the voluntary labors, to which he gave much time or little, brought him no increase of those necessaries, but only credit and affection. We had always heard it said that the love of money was the root of all evil, but we had taken this for a saying, merely; now we realized it as an active, vital truth. As soon as money was abolished the power to purchase was gone, and even if there had been any means of buying beyond the daily needs, with overwork, the community had no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> to the individual.

6000|$|O but, says Christ, {{the land}} is undivided; no man has his part set out and turned over to himself; besides, my brethren yet are under age, and I am made their guardian; they have not <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the land for ever; {{the land is}} mine; also my Father has made me feoffee in trust for my brethren, {{that they may have}} what is allotted them when they are all come to a perfect man, [...] "unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" [...] (Eph 4:13).

And what can Satan say against this plea? Can he prove that Christ has no interest in the saints' inheritance? Can he prove that we are at age, or that our several parts of the heavenly house are already delivered into our own power? And if he goes about to do this, is not {{the law of the land}} against him? Doth it not say that our Advocate is [...] "Lord of all," [...] (Acts 10:36), that the kingdom is Christ's, that it is laid up in heaven for us, (Eph 5:5, Col 1:5); yea, that the [...] "inheritance which is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, is reserved in heaven for us, who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation" [...] (I Peter 1:4, 5). Thus therefore is our heavenly inheritance made good by our Advocate against the thwartings and branglings29 of the devil; nor can our new sins make it invalid, but it abideth safe to us at last, notwithstanding our weaknesses; though, if we sin, we may have but little comfort of it, or but little of its present profits, while we live in this present world. A spendthrift, though he loses not his title, may yet lose the present benefit, but the principal will come again at last; for [...] "we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." ...|$|E
