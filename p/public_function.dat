5|$|The DMK party {{celebrated the}} success of Nadodi Mannan with a <b>public</b> <b>function</b> on 16 October 1958 at the Tamukkam Ground in Madurai. The function, which was {{attended}} by 200,000 people, saw Ramachandran being taken in a procession on a chariot drawn by four horses and garlanded twice. He was awarded a golden sword worth 110 pounds by the party leader C. N. Annadurai and member V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. Ramachandran later donated the sword to the Kollur Mookambika Temple. The film's 100th day theatrical run celebrations were held on 30 November 1958 at the Alagappa College in Madurai.|$|E
5|$|The General Services Administration (GSA) {{attempted}} {{to dispose of}} the Federal Reserve Bank Building through its surplus federal property procedures, but by November 2014 received no compelling applications from government agencies and organizations with a <b>public</b> <b>function.</b> A public auction began on December 5, 2014, with a starting bid set at $5 million, and was initially set to end on January 28, 2015; in late January, bids rose to near $10 million between the eight bidders and forced the auction's deadline to be extended into the following month. Bidding closed on February 7, 2015, with a high bid of $16 million submitted by an undisclosed bidder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a <b>public</b> <b>function.</b> These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E

25|$|The {{first record}} of Alexios in a <b>public</b> <b>function</b> {{was at a}} synod at the {{imperial}} Palace of Blachernae, along with his brother John, on 12 May 1157. He also participated along with John in the synod of March 1166. In both cases, Alexios is recorded without any rank or title, among the imperial relatives. In May/June 1167, following the dismissal and banishment of the hitherto holder, Alexios Axouch, Alexios Komnenos assumed the high office of prōtostratōr. He appears with this rank in the synod of February 1170 against John Eirenikos. Sometime during the period where he held the office of prōtostratōr, i.e. 1167–76, Alexios fell gravely ill, and his wife donated a richly embroidered veil to the Church of the Saviour at the Chalke Gate, an occasion celebrated by an anonymous court poet.|$|E

500|$|In Richardson's {{previous}} novels, {{the letters}} operated {{as a way}} to express internal feelings and describe the private lives of characters; however, the letters of Grandison serve a <b>public</b> <b>function.</b> [...] The letters are not kept to individuals, but forwarded to others to inform a larger community of the novel's action. In return, letters share the recipients' responses to the events detailed within the letters. This sharing of personal feelings transforms the individual responders into a chorus that praises the actions of Grandison, Harriet, and Clementina. Furthermore, this chorus of characters emphasises the importance of the written word over the merely subjective, even saying that [...] "Love declared on paper means far more than love declared orally".|$|E
500|$|For a {{decision}} by a body to be amenable to judicial review, United Kingdom and Singapore law requires the decision to have some public element, and not to relate exclusively to private law matters. The public element is determined by considering if the body's power stems from a legal source (the [...] "source test"), or if {{the nature of the}} body is that it is carrying out some <b>public</b> <b>function</b> (the [...] "nature test"). If the power exercised by a body has a legislative source, it will ordinarily be amenable to judicial review in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, but this is not an invariable rule and decisions without a sufficient public element will not be amenable to review. The latter is also the result when a body is regarded has having acted pursuant to a contract between it and the aggrieved party, rather than having exercised its statutory powers.|$|E
500|$|Bribery {{of foreign}} public {{officials}} {{is a distinct}} crime under Section 6, {{in line with the}} OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. A person will be guilty of this offence if they promise, offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as [...] " [...] an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a <b>public</b> <b>function</b> for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of [...] "through a third party" [...] is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid committing a crime, although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed. Unlike with general bribery offences, there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.|$|E
