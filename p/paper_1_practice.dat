40|$|ABSTRACT This paper compares {{different}} normative {{and institutional}} paradigms of journalism {{with respect to}} peaceful conflict resolution and democratic communication. It begins with the problematic but still dominant “regime of objectivity, ” and then considers three contemporary challengers: peace journalism, alternative media, and media democratization/communication rights movements. The paradigms are compared in terms of such factors as public philosophy, epistemological assumptions, characteristic practices, institutional entailments, relationship to dominant institutions and power structures, allies and opponents, and antagonisms and synergies between them. I conclude with strategic considerations for cultivating social justice-oriented journalism. Struggles for peace and justice are also struggles for democratic communication. That is a core premise of this <b>paper.</b> <b>1</b> Communication <b>practices</b> and institutions (particularly journalism as a culturally central form of storytelling) are interwoven with movements for and against social justice, with contemporary processes of peace and war, 2 This paper explores possibilities for transforming journalism so that it might bette...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} control of requirements evolution in an avionics safety-critical system. Metrics {{can be used to}} manage (e. g., control and predict) requirements evolution. The results point out issues in the use of metrics for controlling requirements evolution in the case study. Moreover, they provide new evidence, which suggests a product line oriented management method for requirements. The empirical analysis supports a number of remarks that are described through the <b>paper.</b> <b>1</b> Introduction Current <b>practice</b> in Software Engineering [1, 13, 17] emphasises the need for iterative development processes refining the software product in all its related representations (e. g., software requirements specification, design specification, testing activities, source code, etc.).

40|$|This study {{partially}} replicates McManus and Marsden (2016), {{who found}} that providing L 1 explicit information (EI) plus task-essential practice led L 2 learners to make more accurate and faster interpretations of French morphosyntax.

40|$|Agricultural {{decision-making}} {{to control}} nonpoint source (NPS) water pollution {{may not be}} efficiently implemented, {{if there is no}} appropriate cost-benefit analysis on agricultural management practices. This paper presents an interval-fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) model to deal with the trade-off between agricultural revenue, NPS pollution control, and alternative practices through land adjustment for Wuchuan catchment, a typical agricultural area in Jiulong River watershed, Fujian Province of China. From the results, the lower combination of <b>practice</b> <b>1,</b> <b>practice</b> 2, practice 3, and practice 7 with the land area of 12. 6, 5. 2, 145. 2, and 85. 3 hm(2), respectively, could reduce NPS pollution load by 10 %. The combination yields an income of 98, 580 Chinese Yuan/a. If the pollution reduction is 15 %, the higher combination need <b>practice</b> <b>1,</b> <b>practice</b> 2, practice 3, practice 5, and practice 7 with the land area of 54. 4, 23. 6, 18. 0, 6. 3, and 85. 3 hm(2), respectively. The income of this combination is 915, 170 Chinese Yuan/a. The sensitivity analysis of IFLP indicates that the cost-effective practices are ranked as follows: practice 7 > practice 2 > <b>practice</b> <b>1</b> > <b>practice</b> 5 > practice 3 > practice 6 > practice 4. In addition, the uncertainties in the agriculture NPS pollution control system could be effectively quantified by the IFLP model. Furthermore, to accomplish a reasonable and applicable project of land-use adjustment, decision-makers could also integrate above solutions with their own experience and other information...|$|R
