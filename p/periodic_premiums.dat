40|$|We {{consider}} the unit-linked endowment with guarantee and <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums,</b> where at each premium payment date {{the insurance company}} invests a certain fraction of the premium into a risky reference portfolio. In the dual random environment of stochastic interest rates with deterministic volatilities and mortality risk, and for a fixed guarantee, simple analytical lower and upper bounds for the fair periodic premium are explicitly derived. We also consider contracts with guaranteed minimum benefits that vary over time and we obtain tight lower and upper bounds for both fair <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums</b> and guaranteed minimum benefits that increase over time. The numerical illustrations of our results reveal that the analytical bounds are very tight. Moreover, the simple, fast and very reliable analytical numerical calculations with controlled accuracy avoid time consuming Monte Carlo calculations and are almost always preferred by practitioners.

40|$|Assuming {{constant}} {{interest rates}} Brennan and Schwartz (1976, 1979) obtained the rational insurance premium on an equity-linked insurance contract {{through the application}} of the theory of contingent claims pricing. Further considerations with deterministic interest rates have been discussed in Aase and Persson (1992) and in Persson (1993). Analysing the single premium case Bacinello and Ortu (1993 b) allow for the short term interest rate to develop in accordance to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In a paper from 1994 they consider extensions to both the single and the <b>periodic</b> <b>premium</b> model. This paper presents a model similar to the one by Bacinello and Ortu (1994) for the <b>periodic</b> <b>premium</b> case with a stochastic interest rate dynamic. It is shown that the insurance contract includes an Asian-like option contract. Sufficient conditions on the guaranteed amount for the existence of a solution are derived. As no closed form solution will be obtained, we discuss different numerical approaches and apply Monte Carlo simulations with a variance reduction technique.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} how model misspecification {{associated with}} both interest rate and mortality risk influences hedging decisions of insurance companies. For this purpose, diverse risk management strategies which are risk–minimizing when model risk is ignored come into consideration. The {{effectiveness of these}} strategies is investigated {{by looking at the}} distribution of the resulting hedging er-rors under the combination of both sources of model risk. The analysis is based on endowment assurances which include an investment element together with a sum assured. Normally, the customer contributes <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums.</b> Compared to an upfront premium, this poses an additional risk to the insurance company. Since the premium payments stop {{in the case of an}} early death, it is not known today how many premium payments will be forthcoming. Theoretically, a loan corresponding to the present value of the expected delayed premium payments must be asked for by the insurance company in order to implement his hedging decisions. Therefore, we also consider how model risk affects this borrowing decision...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{net loss of}} a life {{insurance}} company issuing equity-linked pure endowments {{in the case of}} <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums.</b> Due to the untradability of the insurance risk which affects both the in- and outflow side of the company, the issued insurance claims cannot be hedged perfectly. Furthermore, we consider an additional source of incompleteness caused by trading restrictions, because in reality the hedging of the contingent claims is more likely to occur at discrete times. Based on Møller [Møller, T., 1998. Risk-minimizing hedging strategies for unit-linked life insurance contracts. Astin Bull. 28, 17 - 47], we particularly examine the situation, where the company applies a time-discretized risk-minimizing hedging strategy. Through an illustrative example, we observe numerically that only a relatively small reduction in ruin probabilities is achieved {{with the use of the}} discretized originally risk-minimizing strategy because of the accumulated extra duplication errors caused by discretizing. However, the simulated results are highly improved if the hedging model instead of the hedging strategy is discretized. For this purpose, Møller’s [Møller, T., 2001. Hedging equity-linked life insurance contracts. North Amer. Actuarial J. 5 (2), 79 - 95] discrete-time (binomial) risk-minimizing strategy is adopted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} the net loss of a life insurance company issuing identical equity-linked pure endowment contracts {{in the case of}} <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums.</b> Un-der this construction, financial risks as well as the mortality risk are included. Based on Møller (1998), we particularly investigate the situation where the company applies a time-discretized risk-minimizing hedging strategy, i. e., a trading restriction is imposed on a continuous-time risk-minimizing strategy. Therefore, the considered model is incomplete where the incompleteness results not only from the mortality risk but also from the trad-ing restrictions. Through an illustrative example, it is observed from the simulations that a substantial reduction in the ruin probability is achieved by using the time-discretized risk-minimizing strategy. However, as the hedging frequency is set higher, this advantage almost disappears, because a higher frequency leads to more hedging errors which con-stitute {{a vital part of the}} hedger’s net loss. In order to improve the simulated results, another type of discrete-time risk-minimizing strategy is taken into consideration. It is obtained by discretizing the hedging model instead of the hedging strategy. For this pur-pose, Møller’s (2001) discrete-time (binomial) risk-minimizing strategy is adopted. For both strategies, a number of sensitivity analyses are carried out, e. g. how the ruin proba-bility changes with the fair combination of the minimum interest rate guarantee and the participation rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} binomial {{model is}} a discrete time analogue (or approximation) of the compound Poisson model of classical risk theory.

40|$|Investments in {{any form}} of {{financial}} product, other than a bank deposit at the risk-free interest rate, involve some sort of risk due to the volatility of the economy. Interest rate risk is the most critical risk factor affecting fixed income securities. However, the growing credit derivatives market is based primarily on credit or default risk. This is the risk caused by {{the possibility that a}} company will have financial troubles and will have to default on payments which it owes to its lenders. US treasury securities are considered to be free of credit risk because they are backed by the government. In order to protect investors from this risk, the credit derivatives market emerged with various products whose sole purpose is to hedge credit risk. A credit derivative is a contract between a protection buyer and a protection seller to transfer the credit risk of an asset without the actual transfer of the asset. The most fundamental credit derivative is the credit default swap. In a credit default swap, the protection buyer makes <b>periodic</b> <b>premium</b> payments to the protection seller in exchange for the promise that if default occurs, the protection seller will receive the defaulted security and repay the protection buyer a percentage of what was owed.

40|$|Pure level term {{insurance}} is the simplest life insurance product. A policyholder pays {{a series of}} equal <b>periodic</b> <b>premiums.</b> If he dies during the term of the policy, his nominee gets the sum assured from the insurer. Instead, if he survives the term of the policy, the insurance company does not pay anything to him. Still, this simple product was not offered in the Indian market till recently. Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India was a government monopoly. LIC offered only the so-called ‘bundled products’, namely, Whole Life, Endowment, Money-Back etc. Such bundled products combine the insurance and savings products into one. A consumer thus could choose {{only one of the}} available benefit bundles: some life insurance, some tax benefits and some (uncertain) investment returns. Fortunately, things are changing. Since the liberalization of the insurance industry, several private insurers have entered the market with pure term insurance products. This has forced LIC also to offer its own term insurance product. Aggressive pricing by competing insurers has led to a dramatic reduction in premiums. Insurers are also targeting specific buyer segments like high net-worth individuals, younger salary earners, workingwomen etc. New distribution channels like corporate agencies, including banks, have been permitted. Given their simplicity, term products may be the first to be pushed through such new channels, at significantly lower distribution costs than the traditional agency channel.

40|$|Whether it {{concerns}} a private individual, a corporate, {{a financial institution}} or even a government, we all obey the rule that he who lends money to a counterparty is exposed {{to the risk of}} financial loss, in case the borrower fails to honor the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement. One speaks of default by the obligor and, broadly, refers to the associated risk as credit risk. As in the traditional life and non-life insurance industry,bilateral contracts are developed, by financial institutions, that allow for a risk-transfer between the lender (the protection buyer) and a third party (the protection seller). The protection seller agrees to cover(part of) the loss suffered by the lender in the (uncertain) event of adefault by the borrower (the reference entity). In return for this assurance, the protection buyer pays a <b>periodic</b> <b>premium</b> to the protection seller. Like insurance products, the value of these so-called credit derivatives depends entirely on the underlying (credit) risk. Moreover, thesecontracts can generally be entered into cost-free. No initial payment is required by either of the parties in order to close the deal. Such instruments are called unfunded. However, unlike traditional insurance contracts, credit derivatives can be traded. The corresponding market has seen an exponential growth over the last fifteenyears. From almost nothing in 1995, the total market notional now exceeds 30 trillion (1012) U. S. dollar, according to recent estimates (mid 2009). Moreover, by now this market is well-established, strictly-regulated and (highly) liquid. No doubt, the major catalyst for this immense succes is that, by mitigating risk exposures, credit derivatives can be used to offset and reduce the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Basel II Capital Accord (2004). The latter agreement provides a unified framework for minimal capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline, but fails to adopt a standardized approach with regard to assessing credit risk. On the contrary, under the internal ratings-based approach institutions are encouraged to usetheir own internal measures for the key drivers of credit risk, powering the demand for models to price credit derivatives. As key drivers, Basel II identifies the reference entity's default probability and the loss-given-default, i. e. the percentage of the exposure-at-default that willnot be recovered following default. However, with regard to funded credit derivatives and securitization in general, a third driver comes to play, namely the prepayment risk, i. e. the potential loss due to the full or partial early redemption of the outstandingdebt by borrowers. In case of funded derivatives, protection is bought by a so-called special purpose vehicle and payments under the credit derivative are funded using securitization techniques. Securitization is a transaction where the cash flows from an underlying pool of exposures (e. g. loans) are used to service at least two different series (tranches) of bonds (called securities). These tranches reflect different degrees of credit risk. This allows investors to select those securities that match their personal risk appetite. In this dissertation, building on the extensive literature on structural models for credit risk, we develop an integrated mathematical framework for default risk, loss-given-default and prepayment risk; with a focus towards securitization and a clear preference for Lévy processes as the stochastic mechanism to describe the underlying price dynamics. In the last decade, research departments of major banks started to accept jump processes as avaluable tool in modeling day-to-day market fluctuations. This increasing interest in Lévy models in finance {{can be attributed to the}} flexibility of the underlying probability distributions and to the presence of jumps in the sample paths. The distributions allow for skewness and excesskurtosis, granting a sufficiently high probability to the risk of extreme price movements over short time intervals. Moreover, the sample pathscan adequately represent the sudden jumps in the observed prices. It isof key importance to deal with these shocks if the market risk is to bemeasured and managed correctly. The text is structured as follows. Chapter 1 is intended as an accessible introduction to credit risk and securitization. We introduce the former concept based on several real-life examples. Next, we elaborate on credit derivatives. We explain the notion of a derivative instrument, look at the development of the market, discuss the different counterparties involved in the contract and overview the most important products. Subsequently, we clarify the idea of securitization. We show how this originally as a financing transaction intended technique can also be used to mitigate credit risk. We end the chapter with a preamble on credit risk modeling. Chapter 2 provides the necessary mathematical background. We introduce the basics of probability theory from a measure-theoretic point of view. Subsequently, we define the important concepts of a probability space, a random variable and a stochastic process. A second part is devoted to mathematical finance in continuous time. We discuss filtrations and clarify the important no-arbitrage theory and the relatedrisk-neutral valuation principle. The chapter ends with a remark about homogeneous portfolios. Chapter 3 is dedicatedto Lévy processes. In this dissertation, the latter are the elected tool to describe the price mechanism of the reference asset and the corresponding derivative instrument. We formally define a Lévy process and debate its structure and properties. Next, we discuss a technique that allows to generate sample paths of almost any Lévy process. Then, we provide several examples of Lévy processes that will be used in the subsequent chapters. Thereafter, we introduce the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. We grant special attention to the particular case of the Gamma-OU process, that will appear later on. A justification as to why use Lévy processes in finance concludes the chapter. Chapter 4 deals with modeling the risks of default and prepayment within a securitization framework. We review the two most popular approachesto assess credit risk, i. e. the firm-value and the reduced-form approach. With regard to the probability of default, we discuss several well-acknowledged, several recently developed and some new (Lévy-based) models under both approaches. We examine how these can be adjusted and tailoredto fit within the securitization frame. All models are either based on the Normal distribution or on the Gamma distribution. Next, we focus on describing the risk of prepayment. Thereby, we enlist on the default risk models and extend the latter to be able to cope with prepayment. A major challenge, in this respect, is taking the correlation between these two risks into account. At the end of the chapter we discuss a case studywhere the developed models are used in an algorithm to determine the rating of two tranches of loan-backed securities. In Chapter 5 we discuss a generic framework to obtain stochastic loss-given-default in an arbitrary firm-value model for credit risk. We implement the technique into the Normal one-factor and the Gamma one-factor models. Next, we examine how stochastic loss-given-default influences thecapital charges under the Basel II Accord (2004). We also compare our approach to two models recently developed in the banking industry. Finally, we look at the impact of stochastic loss-given-default on the rating of the securities in the case study of the previous chapter. Chapter 6 is a stand-alone chapter. Here, we investigate the practical implementation of a particular member of a new ten-parameter family of Lévy processes, referred to as the Beta-family, introduced by Kuznetsov (2009). The process that we concentrate on is parameterizedin order to resemble the popular Variance-Gamma process due to Carr, Chang and Madan (1998). We therefore have baptized the new model as the Beta-Variance Gamma model. We discuss and examine its applications in pricing equity derivatives and credit derivatives. A summary of the main results and an outlook to future research conclude the study. nrpages: 260 status: publishe...|$|R
