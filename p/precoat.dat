30|$|The {{conventional}} bracket demonstrated higher ARI {{scores than}} the <b>precoated</b> bracket system immediately after bonding and 24  h after bonding. In other words, the <b>precoated</b> brackets had less adhesive remaining after debonding. This is {{perhaps due to}} the fact that <b>precoated</b> brackets have a premeasured uniform layer of adhesive that is coated in a manner that leaves less adhesive after application, perhaps facilitating optimal application of the brackets to the tooth surface, minimizing adhesive quantity. It is also possible that this is a result of the uniform pressure applied in placing the adhesive on the mesh during machine <b>precoating</b> of the bracket during manufacturing, allowing better penetration of the bracket mesh.|$|R

30|$|Since {{there were}} no {{significant}} differences in the bonding strength after 24  h, the immediate bonding strength of the <b>precoated</b> brackets during the first day does not appear to be a major advantage over the conventional bracket systems.

5000|$|The {{rotary vacuum}} drum filter designs {{available}} vary in physical aspects and their characteristics. The filtration area ranges from 0.5 m2 to 125 m2. Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter cloth washing is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger rotary vacuum drum filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around rotary vacuum drum filter in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that <b>precoat</b> can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of <b>precoat</b> more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the rotary vacuum drum filter build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process.

40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered filter elements, sintered ceramic fllter elements, cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth <b>precoat</b> filter, and a wood-cellulose <b>precoat</b> filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and <b>precoat</b> filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the <b>precoat</b> filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the <b>precoat</b> filter was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an element type <b>precoat</b> filter using wood cellulose as the <b>precoat</b> media would be most suitable for the proposed application.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of femoral stem failure after ce-mented total hip {{arthroplasty}} is aseptic loosening. Labora-tory studies of postmortem specimens and finite element analysis revealed that loosening of the femoral stem is initiated by debonding at the cement-prosthesis interface.

However, the clinical results of <b>precoated</b> femoral stem have been reported diversely. Background: There has been controversy whether methylmethacrylate <b>precoating</b> of the cemented femoral stem is a solution for aseptic loosening or rather contributes to increased failure rates in cemented total hip arthroplasties.

40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central <b>precoat</b> filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the <b>precoat</b> filter with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The <b>precoat</b> filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central <b>precoat</b> filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central <b>precoat</b> filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|E

40|$|The <b>precoat</b> {{filtration}} with body-feed is an {{unit operation}} of agricultural and food engineering. Mostly {{it is implemented}} by using centrifugal pump, which pump curve has a partial horizontal trend. Classically, in filtration theory, this prerogative of the centrifugal pumps leads to the simplifying assumption that filtration occurs with constant pressure. Because of this, {{it is easy to}} integrate the Darcy’s differential equation [1, 2 and 3] for the <b>precoat</b> filtration with body-feed, obtaining the well known Carman equation [4]. This is the equation which relates the filtration time with the filtrate volume, the operating pressure, the filter area, and the solid-liquid suspension characteristics. The Carman equation is the start point for the subsequent optimization of the filtration cycles, e. g. by establishing the relationship between the filtration time and the filter cleaning time [5]. A better optimization of the <b>precoat</b> filtration with body-feed could be obtain, with some economic benefits, if an integration of the Darcy ODE was developed starting from actual trend of the pressure produced by the centrifugal pump, that is if a variable pressure was considered, as expected from the pump curve. In this sense a proposal was done by Tiller and Crump [6] many years ago in accordance with a graphic method of integration of the Darcy ODE. However the graphic procedure is tedious since it is iterative and not computerizable. For this reason the aim of this work was to find an analytical solution to the Darcy ODE for the filtration with variable pressure in order to obtain a quick and easy-to-use equation for the subsequent optimization calculations of filtration cycles, even if more complex of the Carman equation...|$|E
