40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the determinants <b>of</b> delays in <b>Preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This study was conducted in Sarmi Regency. The population was member of budget board in the House of Representative, budget team from the government agencies and government officials from each work units. There were 60 respondents using a direct survey to collect data. A multiple regressions were employed to empirically test research hypotheses. The research revealed that relation between executive and legislative positively associated with delays in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure. In other words, the better relation between executive and legislative are likely to lower the delays in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Also, the educational backgrounds positively influence delays in the <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure. It means that advancement in educational backgrounds are likely to lower delays in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Another factor was performance indicators which positively associate with delays in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This infers that increase in performance indicators will likely to lower delays in <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Meanwhile, commitment was not supported.

40|$|The {{importance}} of VP 7 of bluetongue virus (BTV) in the binding of BTV to membrane proteins of the BTV vector Culicoides variipennis was investigated. Core BTV particles, prepared from whole viruses, lacked outer proteins VP 2 and VP 5 and had VP 7 exposed. More core particles and whole viruses bound to membrane <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> adults of C. variipennis and KC cells, which were cultured from this vector insect, than to membrane <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> Manduca sexta larvae. More core particles than whole viruses bound to membrane <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> adults of C. variipennis and KC cells. Polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id), which were made against an antigen-combining region of an anti-BTV- 10 VP 7 antibody and functionally mimicked VP 7, bound {{more to the}} membrane <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> adults of C. variipennis and KC cells, and less to cytosol preparations. In Western overlay analysis, the Culicoides plasma membrane <b>preparation</b> reduced binding <b>of</b> an anti-VP 7 monoclonal antibody to VP 7. Whole and core BTV particles and the anti-Id bound to a membrane protein with a molecular mass of 23 kDa that was present predominantly in membrane <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> adults of C. variipennis and KC cells.
