40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two aspects}} related to <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> in Europe. First, we {{will present the}} evolution of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> across European countries during the last crisis. Second, the paper will analyse and identify the main determinants of the European <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> market, using an empirical panel analysis. The empirical model includes many of the determinants already tested in previous studies (GDP growth, Market Capitalization, Research and Development Expenditures, Interest rates, etc.) and also new variables such as productivity and corruption index which we consider important factors in explaining the evolution of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> in Europe. The present research paper follows the equilibrium model of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> (Gompers and Lerner 1998, Jeng and Wells 2000, Romain and de La Potteria 2004, Félix 2007).

25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control. Finally, private equity firms only take long positions, for short selling is not possible in this asset class.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the origins}} of the modern private equity {{industry}} in 1946, there have been four major epochs marked by three boom and bust cycles. The early history of private equity—from 1946 through 1981—was characterized by relatively small volumes of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investment,</b> rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry. The first boom and bust cycle, from 1982 through 1993, was characterized by the dramatic surge in leveraged buyout activity financed by junk bonds and culminating in the massive buyout of RJR Nabisco before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] The second boom and bust cycle (from 1992 through 2002) emerged from the ashes of the savings and loan crisis, the insider trading scandals, the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s. [...] This period saw the emergence of more institutionalized private equity firms, ultimately culminating in the massive Dot-com bubble in 1999 and 2000.
