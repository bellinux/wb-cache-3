40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) gene expression in human placenta varies as a function of gestational age and to evaluate whether bFGF synthesis might be altered in pathological pregnancies. Moreover, we also investigated whether human placental cells express the bFGF receptor gene. The presence of mRNA for bFGF and its receptor was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on total RNA derived from human placental cells at different times of culture. Levels of bFGF mRNA were determined by competitive RT-PCR in human placental tissues collected at the beginning {{and at the end of}} pregnancy. Competitive RT-PCR was also employed to evaluate bFGF synthesis in term <b>placentas</b> <b>derived</b> from pregnancies complicated by diabetes. mRNA for both bFGF and its receptor were demonstrated in human placenta starting as early as 8 weeks of pregnancy. Values of bFGF mRNA were significantly higher in first trimester compared with term <b>placentas.</b> Term <b>placentas</b> <b>derived</b> from pregnancies associated with type I diabetes expressed levels of bFGF mRNA higher than those present in normal term placentas. These data demonstrate that bFGF and its receptor are synthesized in human placental cells throughout gestation. Moreover, bFGF gene expression is developmentally regulated. Finally, bFGF might also be partially responsible for the placental alterations observed in pregnancies complicated by diabetes...|$|R

40|$|The role of fat {{metabolism}} during human pregnancy, {{placental growth}} and function is poorly understood. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders in an affected fetus {{are associated with}} maternal diseases of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and the Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome. We have investigated the developmental expression and activity of six fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes at various gestational age human placentae. Placental specimens exhibited abundant expression of all six enzymes, as assessed by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses, with greater staining in syncytiotrophoblasts as compared to other placental cell types. β-oxidation enzyme activities in placental tissues were higher early in gestation and lower near term. Trophoblast cells in culture oxidized tritium-labeled palmitate and myristate in substantial amounts, indicating that the human placenta utilizes fatty acids as a significant metabolic fuel.

40|$|Preeclampsia (PE) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{maternal}} and perinatal mortality and morbidity. One of the main hallmarks observed in PE is impaired inflammation state. In the current study, we found that miR- 125 b was deregulated in placental tissues and plasma derived from PE patients, which suggest a potential association between this miRNA and the pathogenesis of PE. Overexpression of miR- 125 b significantly reduced SGPL 1 expression, and luciferase assays confirmed that SGPL 1 is a direct target of miR- 125 b. We also found that miR- 125 b enhanced IL- 8 production by directly targeting sphingosine- 1 -phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL 1), and this effect could be reversed by SGPL 1 overexpression. In <b>placentas</b> <b>derived</b> from PE patients, a negative correlation of miR- 125 b and SGPL 1 was observed, and IL- 8 was validated to be increased in the circulation of PE patients.

Vitamin D-binding protein transports vitamin D and influences the metabolism of this key hormone {{but it also}} has additional immunomodulatory and actin-clearing properties. We investigated whether vitamin D-binding protein expression is altered in fetal growth restriction-associated placental dysfunction. Protein was extracted from 35 <b>placentae</b> <b>derived</b> from 17 healthy control subjects and 18 gestation-matched subjects with fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR subjects were further subdivided as idiopathic (n= 9) and nonidiopathic (n= 9). Vitamin D-binding protein and 25 (OH) vitamin D were measured by ELISA and normalized to protein concentration. The results showed significantly reduced levels of placental vitamin D-binding protein (control versus FGR, p< 0. 05, Student’s t-test) that were strongly associated with idiopathic fetal growth restriction (p< 0. 01, Kruskal-Wallis), whereas levels of vitamin D-binding protein were not associated with placental 25 (OH) vitamin D stores (p= 0. 295, Pearson’s correlation). As such, vitamin D-binding protein may be a factor in unexplained placental dysfunction associated with idiopathic fetal growth restriction and may potentially serve as a biomarker of this disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemokine}} fractalkine {{is considered}} as unique since it exists both as membrane-bound adhesion molecule and as shed soluble chemoattractant. Here the hypothesis was tested whether placental fractalkine can be shed and {{released into the}} maternal circulation. Immunohistochemical staining of human first trimester and term placenta sections localized fractalkine at the apical microvillous plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. Gene expression analysis revealed abundant upregulation in placental fractalkine at term, compared to first trimester. Fractalkine expression and release were detected in the trophoblast cell line BeWo, in primary term trophoblasts and placental explants. Incubation of BeWo cells and placental explants with metalloprotease inhibitor Batimastat inhibited the release of soluble fractalkine {{and at the same}} time increased the membrane-bound form. These results demonstrate that human placenta is a source for fractalkine, which is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and can be released into the maternal circulation by constitutive metalloprotease dependent shedding. Increased expression and release of placental fractalkine may contribute to low grade systemic inflammatory responses in third trimester of normal pregnancy.

40|$|Placental tissue draws great {{interest}} {{as a source}} of cells for regenerative medicine because of the phenotypic plasticity of many of the cell types isolated from this tissue. Furthermore, placenta, which is involved in maintaining fetal tolerance, contains cells that display immunomodulatory properties. These two features could prove useful for future cell therapy-based clinical applications. Placental tissue is readily available and easily procured without invasive procedures, and its use does not elicit ethical debate. Numerous reports describing stem cells from different parts of the placenta, using nearly as numerous isolation and characterization procedures, have been published. Considering the complexity of the placenta, an urgent need exists to define, as clearly as possible, the region of origin and methods of isolation of cells derived from this tissue. On March 23 - 24, 2007, the first international Workshop on <b>Placenta</b> <b>Derived</b> Stem Cells was held in Brescia, Italy.

The studies utilized the WF (u) and DA (a) strains and monoclonal antibodies {{to all of the}} class I antigens involved. All four mating combinations of the two strains showed that only paternal antigens were expressed in the placenta and that they were limited to the basal trophoblast. This conclusion was confirmed using embryo transfer experiments. In allogeneic natural matings, the allele-specific class I transplantation antigens were not expressed on the membrane of the basal trophoblast but they were expressed in embryo transfers involving embryos of the same genotype. In both types of pregnancies, the pregnancy-associated (Pa) antigen was present on the membrane of the basal trophoblast. The antibody response to DA X DA and to WF X DA embryos transferred into pseudopregnant WF females was against the allele-specific RT 1. Aa antigen and the Pa antigen, whereas the antibody response to the heterozygous embryo in the natural WF (female) X DA (male) mating was against the Pa antigen only.

By methylation-specific PCR, we observed both methylated and unmethylated Oct 4 alleles in all 25 first trimester and 10 term placentas while 33 % (18 / 54) of hydatidiform moles, and two choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG 3 and JAR), only displayed methylated Oct 4 allele. By quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR, Oct 4 mRNA was significantly reduced in hydatidiform moles (P = 0. 04), JEG 3 and JAR (P = 0. 024) when compared with normal placentas. Oct 4 methylation was significantly correlated with Oct 4 mRNA expression in placenta and GTD (P = 0. 012). Hypermethylation in minimal promoter and exon 1 region of Oct 4 were confirmed in JEG 3 and JAR by bisulfite genomic sequencing. The Oct 4 mRNA expression in JEG 3 and JAR increased after treatment with 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A.

40|$|CNN 3 is an ubiquitously {{expressed}} F-actin binding protein, {{shown to}} regulate trophoblast fusion and hence seems {{to play a}} role in the placentation process. In this study we demonstrate that CNN 3 levels are upregulated under low oxygen conditions in the trophoblast cell line BeWo. Since hypoxia is discussed to be a pro-migratory stimulus for placental cells, we examined if CNN 3 is involved in trophoblast invasion. Indeed, when performing a matrigel invasion assay we were able to show that CNN 3 promotes BeWo cell invasion. Moreover, CNN 3 activates the MAPKs ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 in trophoblast cells and interestingly, both kinases are involved in BeWo invasion. However, when we repeated the experiments under hypoxic conditions, CNN 3 did neither promote cell invasion nor MAPK activation. These results indicate that CNN 3 promotes invasive processes by the stimulation of ERK 1 / 2 and/or p 38 under normoxic conditions in BeWo cells, but seems to have different functions at low oxygen levels. We further speculated that CNN 3 expression might be altered in human <b>placentas</b> <b>derived</b> from pregnancies complicated by IUGR and preeclampsia, since these placental disorders have been described to go along with impaired trophoblast invasion. Our studies show that, at least in our set of placenta samples, CNN 3 expression is neither deregulated in IUGR nor in preeclampsia.

Although promising results have been reported following chromatin transfer (CT), a novel cloning method that includes the remodeling of the donor nuclei in vitro prior to their transfer into enucleated oocytes, animals cloned by CT show placental abnormalities similar to those observed following conventional nuclear transfer.

Better characterisation of STBM {{is essential to}} understand their role in PE. Methods and Results: STBM prepared by placental lobe dual perfusion (pSTBM) and mechanical disruption (mSTBM) were analysed by four colour flow cytometry (4 CFC), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Western blotting to determine vesicle size, purity and Flt- 1 and endoglin (Eng) expression. Biological activity of STBM associated Flt- 1 and endoglin was assessed by the ability of VEGF, PlGF and TGFb to bind to mSTBM and inhibit mSTBM induced endothelial monolayer disruption. STBM content was consistently high (, 87 – 95 %) across the different preparations. However, surface antigen intensities differed, with significantly lower placental alkaline phosphatase (P, 0. 05) and Eng (P, 0. 05) expression on mSTBM, and Flt- 1 (P, 0. 05) expression on pSTBM. For PE <b>placenta</b> <b>derived</b> preparations, pSTBM contained lower Eng positive STBM (P, 0. 05) and mSTBM Eng expression was increased (P, 0. 05).

We identified the differential expression genes (DEGs) based on the Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: According to the DEGs of umbilical cord and placenta, we used the Venn diagram to evaluate the consistence and specific genes. There are 390 umbilical cord specific DEGs which functions are related to movement of sub-cellular component. Then, the DEGs <b>derived</b> from <b>placenta</b> have two major clusters (i. e., placenta-specific (AM-CM-specific) and UC-like (UC-CD-specific)). 247 placenta-specific DEGs are down-regulated and involved in cell communication. 278 UC-like genes are up-regulated and are involved in the cell cycle, cell division, and DNA repair process.

Expression of Peg 3 in brain has previously been linked maternal behaviour in rodents, at least in some studies, with mutant dams neglecting their pups. However, in our human study decreased expression was in the <b>placenta</b> <b>derived</b> from the fetus. Here, we examined maternal behaviour in response to reduced expression of Peg 3 in the feto-placental unit. Prenatally we found novelty reactivity was altered in wildtype females carrying litters with a null mutation in Peg 3.

USVs are a form of communication known to elicit maternal care suggesting Peg 3 mutant pups drive the deficit in maternal behaviour.

Cloned placentae showed upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2 (TIMP- 2), which is involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling, and downregulation of pre-B cell colony enhancing factor 1 (PBEF), which inhibits apoptosis and induces spontaneous labor. Here, we used Western blotting to further analyze the protein expression levels of TIMP- 2 and PBEF in cloned <b>placentae</b> <b>derived</b> from cumulus cells, TSA-treated cumulus cells, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and natural mating (NM control). Cloned and TSA-treated cloned placentae had higher expression levels of TIMP- 2 compared with NM control and ICSI-derived placentae, {{and there was a}} positive association between TIMP- 2 expression and the placental weight of cloned mouse concepti. Conversely, PBEF protein expression was significantly lower in cloned and ICSI placentae compared to NM controls. To examine whether the observed differences were due to abnormal gene expression caused by faulty epigenetic reprogramming in clones, we investigated DNA methylation and histone modification in the promoter regions of the genes encoding TIMP- 2 and PBEF. Sodium bisulfite sequencing did not reveal any difference in DNA methylation between cloned and NM control placentae. However, ChIP assays revealed that the level of H 3 -K 9 /K 14 acetylation at the TIMP- 2 locus was higher in cloned placentae than in NM controls, whereas acetylation of the PBEF promoter was lower in cloned and ICSI placenta versus NM controls. These results suggest that cloned placentae appear to suffer from failure of histone modification-based reprogramming in these (and potentially other) developmentally important genes, leading to aberrant expression of their protein products.

Abnormal levels of STBEVs have been proposed to affect maternal vascular function. The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor- 1 (LOX- 1) is a multi-ligand scavenger receptor. Increased LOX- 1 expression and activation has been proposed to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. As LOX- 1 has various ligands, we hypothesized that, being essentially packages of lipoproteins, STBEVs are able to activate the LOX- 1 receptor thereby impairing vascular function via the production of superoxide and decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Uterine arteries were obtained in late gestation from Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated for 24 h with or without human STBEVs (derived from a normal pregnant placenta) in the absence or presence of a LOX- 1 blocking antibody. Vascular function was assessed using wire myography. Endothelium-dependent maximal vasodilation to methylcholine was impaired by STBEVs (MCh Emax: 57. 7 ± 5. 9 % in STBEV-incubated arteries vs. 77. 8 ± 2. 9 % in controls, p< 0. 05). This was prevented by co-incubation of STBEV-incubated arteries with LOX- 1 blocking antibodies (MCh Emax: 78. 8 ± 4. 3 %, p< 0. 05). Pre-incubation of the vessels with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) demonstrated that the STBEV-induced impairment in vasodilation was due to decreased nitric oxide contribution (ΔAUC 12. 2 ± 11. 7 in STBEV-arteries vs. 86. 5 ± 20 in controls, p< 0. 05), which was abolished by LOX- 1 blocking antibody (ΔAUC 98. 9 ± 17, p< 0. 05). In STBEV-incubated vessels, LOX- 1 inhibition resulted in an increased endothelial {{nitric oxide synthase expression}} (p< 0. 05), to a level similar to control vessels. The oxidant scavenger, superoxide dismutase, did not improve this impairment, nor were vascular superoxide levels altered. Our data support an important role for STBEVs in impairment of vascular function via activation of LOX- 1 and reduced nitric oxide mediated vasodilation. Moreover, we postulate that the LOX- 1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in pathologies associated with vascular dysfunction during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|The placental syncytiotrophoblast {{releases}} micro and nanovesicles (STBM), {{into the}} maternal circulation in normal pregnancy and in increased amounts in pre-eclampsia (PE), which have proinflammatory and antiangiogenic activity and are implicated in PE pathophysiology. Better characterisation of STBM {{is essential to}} understand their role in PE. STBM prepared by placental lobe dual perfusion (pSTBM) and mechanical disruption (mSTBM) were analysed by four colour flow cytometry (4 CFC), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Western blotting to determine vesicle size, purity and Flt- 1 and endoglin (Eng) expression. Biological activity of STBM associated Flt- 1 and endoglin was assessed by the ability of VEGF, PlGF and TGFβ to bind to mSTBM and inhibit mSTBM induced endothelial monolayer disruption. STBM content was consistently high (~ 87 - 95 %) across the different preparations. However, surface antigen intensities differed, with significantly lower placental alkaline phosphatase (P< 0. 05) and Eng (P< 0. 05) expression on mSTBM, and Flt- 1 (P< 0. 05) expression on pSTBM. For PE <b>placenta</b> <b>derived</b> preparations, pSTBM contained lower Eng positive STBM (P< 0. 05) and mSTBM Eng expression was increased (P< 0. 05). Western blotting revealed increased Flt- 1 /sFlt- 1 (P< 0. 02) and decreased placental alkaline phosphatase (P = 0. 0002) content of PE placenta pSTBM. Using NTA, perfused PE placentas released significantly larger MV (P< 0. 001). Finally, VEGF, PlGF and TGFβ bound to mSTBM at physiologically relevant concentrations and inhibited mSTBM induced endothelial disruption (P< 0. 05 -P< 0. 001). This study has found differences in physical and antigenic characteristics of normal and PE placenta STBM preparations produced by placental perfusion or mechanical disruption. We have also demonstrated that large quantities of biologically active STBM associated endoglin and Flt- 1 /sFlt- 1 could contribute to the increased circulating levels measured in PE patients {{and add to the}} perturbation of the maternal vascular endothelium, normally attributed to non-membrane bound sFlt- 1 and sEndoglin...|$|R

40|$|The {{fetoplacental}} unit resulting from an allogeneic mating {{is a natural}} allograft that is not rejected by the otherwise immunocompetent mother (1, 2). Of the various hypotheses proposed to explain this phenomenon, the possible absence of major histocompatibility antigens {{from the surface of}} the fetally derived trophoblast cells which lie at the fetomaternal interface has been the focus of extensive investigation (3 - 11). We have recently demonstrated (10) the presence of H- 2 K and D antigens of both maternal and paternal haplotypes on the surface of murine trophoblast cells in suspensions of collagenase-dispersed placentae from 9 to 18 d of gestation, using monospecific antisera and a highly sensitive radioautographic technique. The antigen density on 19 - and 14 -d trophoblasts was comparable to that on adult F 1 thymocytes and a further 50 % increase was observed at term. However, the question still remained as to whether these antigens are expressed in situ, and if so, whether they are detectable on the face of trophoblast cells that line the maternal sinusoids in vivo, and thus accessible to the maternal circulation. Studies by Kirby and Cowell (11) and Parr et al. (12) have demonstrated that H- 2 antigens may be sequestered on one aspect of certain cells, e. g., the epithelial cells of the small intestine and the endoderm cells of the yolk sac. This study was designed to examine the presence of H- 2 K antigens on the sinusoidal surface of murine trophoblast cells in vivo, without destroying the architecture of the intact placenta. The use of a radioautographic technique, after an in vivo perfusion with radioiodinated antibodies via individual placental branches of the uterine artery, ensured high levels of sensitivity. High levels of specificity were provided by the use of monoclonal antibodies raised against the H- 2 K antigens of the paternal haplotype. The visualization and quantitation of radioautographic silver grains on morphologically identified trophoblast cells allowed good resolution. The results revealed significant levels of H- 2 K antigens of the paternal haplotype on the sinusoidal face of mouse trophoblast cells in the labyrinthine region of <b>placentae</b> <b>derived</b> from allogeneic matings...|$|R

30|$|The authors {{demonstrate}} a novel, efficient, and widely applicable approach {{to direct the}} patterning of ligand-functionalized organic nanoparticles <b>derived</b> from <b>albumin</b> on nonconductive, biodegradable polymeric substrates. In contrast to traditional deposition methods for inorganic nanoparticles, the approach involves oxygen plasma treatment of spatially restricted regions on a nonbiopermissive polymer. Albumin nanoparticles conjugated with a truncated fragment of fibronectin containing the Arg-Gly-Asp domain were successfully patterned and used as templates to elicit adhesion and spreading of human mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. Attachment and spreading of both cell types into the plasma-exposed polymer areas was considerably more pronounced than with the ligand alone. The authors hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is oxygen plasma treatment-induced selective enhancement of ligand exposure from the deposited functionalized nanoparticles, which facilitates ligand receptor clustering at the cell membrane. The results highlight a promising nanoscale approach to modulate ligand presentation and spatially direct cell attachment and phenotypic behaviors.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the placental proteome differences between pregnant women complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) {{and those with}} normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methods: We used two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) to separate and compare placental protein levels from GDM and NGT groups. Differentially expressed proteins {{between the two groups}} were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and further confirmed by Western blotting. The mRNA levels of related proteins were measured by realtime RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine the cellular location of the proteins expressed in placenta villi. Results: Twenty-one protein spots were differentially expressed between GDM and NGT placenta villi in the tested samples, fifteen of which were successfully identified by mass spectrometry. The molecular functions of these differentially expressed proteins include blood coagulation, signal transduction, anti-apoptosis, ATP binding, phospholipid binding, calcium ion binding, platelet activation, and tryptophan-tRNA ligase activity. Both protein and mRNA levels of Annexin A 2, Annexin A 5 and 14 - 3 - 3 protein f/d were up-regulated, while the expression of the Ras-related protein Rap 1 A was down-regulated in the GDM placenta group.

40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} in {{the genus}} Mus results in male sterility and X-linked placental dysplasia. We have generated several congenic laboratory mouse lines (Mus musculus) in which {{different parts of}} the maternal X chromosome were derived from M. spretus. A strict positive correlation between placental weight and length of the M. spretus-derived part of the X chromosome was shown. Detailed analysis was carried out with one congenic strain that retained a M. spretus interval between 12. 0 and 30. 74 cM. This strain consistently produced hyperplastic placentas that exhibited an average weight increase of 180 % over the weight of control <b>placentas.</b> In <b>derived</b> subcongenic strains, however, increased placental weight could no longer be observed. Morphometric analysis of these placentas revealed persistence of abnormal morphology. Fully developed placental hyperplasia could be reconstituted by recombination of proximal and central M. spretus intervals with an intervening M. musculus region. These results may suggest that placental dysplasia of interspecific mouse hybrids is caused by multiple loci clustered on the X chromosome that act synergistically. Alternatively, it is possible that changes in chromatin structure in interspecific hybrids that influence gene expression are dependent on the length of the alien chromosome...|$|R

Intestinal outputs of plasma <b>derived</b> proteins (<b>albumin,</b> α 1 antitrypsin, IgG), secretory immunoglobulins (IgA and IgM), cellular constituents (eosinophil cationic protein and neutrophil elastase), and cytokines (interleukin 8 and interleukin 1 β) were measured.  RESULTS—Compared to controls, the 21 CF patients, with no intestinal complications, had increased intestinal outputs of albumin, IgG, IgM, eosinophil cationic protein, neutrophil elastase, interleukin 1 β, and interleukin 8. Similar values were obtained for the CF patients with fibrosing colonopathy.  CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that there is immune activation in the gastrointestinal mucosa of children with cystic fibrosis, which may result from the basic cellular defect.

40|$|Allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (allo-HSCT) is one curative treatment for hematologic malignancies, but is compromised by life threatening complications, such as severe acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). Prediction of severe aGvHD {{as early as possible}} is crucial to allow timely initiation of treatment. Here we report on a multicentre validation of an aGvHD-specific urinary proteomic classifier (aGvHD_MS 17) in 423 patients. Samples (n= 1106) were collected prospectively between day + 7 and day + 130 and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Integration of aGvHD_MS 17 analysis with demographic and clinical variables using a logistic regression model led to correct classification of patients developing severe aGvHD 14 days prior to any clinical signs with 82. 4 % sensitivity and 77. 3 % specificity. Multivariate regression analysis showed that aGvHD_MS 17 positivity was the only strong predictor for aGvHD grade III or IV (P&# 60; 0. 0001).
