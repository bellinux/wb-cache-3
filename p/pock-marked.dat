25|$|Robert Emmet is {{described}} as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, {{the lower part of}} his face slightly <b>pock-marked,</b> his complexion sallow.|$|E
25|$|The church {{found the}} {{building}} needing more care and attention than its worshippers and {{they pulled out}} within a year. It was then bought by an Indian businessman, Jitu Rivall who refurbished it as a 498 seat cinema. It was decided that the <b>pock-marked</b> ceiling was beyond economic repair and a new suspended ceiling was fitted. The premises were also equipped with a new sound system and huge new screen, brought forward of the original proscenium. The cinema re-opened on 31 October 1997 as the New Curzon Cinema, screening Indian Bollywood films.|$|E
500|$|The script—initially called Licence Revoked—was {{written with}} Dalton's {{characterisation}} of Bond in mind, and the obsession with which Bond pursues Sanchez {{on behalf of}} Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because [...] "of his own brutally cut-short marriage." [...] Dalton's darker portrayal of Bond led to the violence being increased and more graphic. Wilson compared the script to Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, where a samurai [...] "without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts, only sowing the seeds of distrust, he manages to have the villain bring himself down". Wilson freely admitted {{that the idea of}} the destruction-from-within aspect of the plot came more from the cinema versions of the Japanese Rōnin tales by Kurosawa or Sergio Leone than from Fleming's use of that plot device from The Man with the Golden Gun. For the location Wilson created the Republic of Isthmus, a banana republic based on Panama, with the <b>pock-marked</b> Sanchez bearing similarities to General Manuel Noriega. The parallels between the two figures were based on Noriega's political use of drug trafficking and money laundering to provide revenues for Panama. Robert Davi suggested the line [...] "loyalty is more important than money", which he felt was fitting to the character of Franz Sanchez, whose actions were noticed by Davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Needham's early life, {{but by the time}} she was middle-aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a brothel in Park Place, St. James. Her house was {{regarded}} as the most exclusive in London, superior to those of Covent Garden, even to that of the other notorious bawd of the time, Mother Wisebourne. [...] She was said to still be attractive in middle-age; Hogarth described her as a [...] "handsome old Procuress... well dressed in silk", but mentions [...] "patches on her face" [...] and in his picture her face is seen to be <b>pock-marked.</b> She went by a number of aliases: Bird, Howard, Blewitt and Trent are among those ascribed to her, although Mother Bird was also the name of another brothel-keeper who was committed to Newgate Prison with Needham in 1724. Needham was apparently ruthless with the girls and women who worked for her. They were forced to hire their dresses from her, and, if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals, she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to debtors' prison until they met her demands (a scheme John Cleland's heroine falls prey to in Fanny Hill (1748)). Once they were too old or too ill to attract customers, she would throw them out.|$|E
2500|$|Golf {{balls are}} spherical, usually white (although other colours are allowed), and {{minutely}} <b>pock-marked</b> by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around {{the ball in}} motion, which delays [...] "boundary layer" [...] separation and reduces the drag-inducing [...] "wake" [...] behind the ball, ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddy, with a <b>pock-marked</b> face, barely any nose, scrofulous, {{his neck}} enfolded in cloth that {{protected}} and hid his affliction, pot-bellied; [...] mouth smiling, lips thick, hair rare, eyebrows absent, {{dressed like a}} little lackey aping his master and with the affectations and the mincing airs of the salon (quoted in Kelly, 2004 – see below).|$|E
2500|$|In adulthood, Stalin {{measured}} [...] tall. To {{give the}} impression that he was taller, he wore stacked shoes, and stood on a small wooden platform during parades. His mustached face was <b>pock-marked</b> from smallpox during childhood. He was born with a webbed left foot, and his left arm had been permanently injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility, which was probably the result of being hit, at the age of 12, by a horse-drawn carriage.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{historical}} {{evidence suggesting that}} the Sinixt were heavily depopulated by one or two smallpox epidemics that preceded the arrival of Scottish and Métis fur-traders of the North West Company. [...] The epidemic of 1781 was likely the biggest single outbreak, with accounts of that epidemic describing a mortality rate up to 80%. [...] David Thompson and other early traders noticed the <b>pock-marked</b> faces of older Sinixt and heard oral accounts of the epidemic. There is also evidence that the Sinixt were seriously affected by the major political upheavals that preceded {{the arrival of the}} Europeans.|$|E

The album's lyrics follow an autobiographical subtext in {{which most of the}} songs deal with her overcoming her tribulations. Andy Gill of The Independent described the album's lyrics as showing that the [...] "path to romantic fulfillment is <b>pock-marked</b> with treachery, uncertainty and secrecy." [...] Lyrics on some of the songs have a [...] "deeper undertow of paranoia" [...] such as [...] "Parachute", [...] "Make Me Cry" [...] and [...] "Don't Talk About This Love", which Gill described as being [...] "a fear that others are bent on destroying her relationship, so 'the less they know, the less they judge'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 June 1918, the 27th Aero Squadron {{entered into}} combat operations. [...] The first patrol was uneventful, and it {{accomplished}} its objective. Many in the squadron were rather surprised as {{there has been}} nothing exciting, that the <b>pock-marked</b> lines seemed so quiet, and no Germans were in the air. The fact was that we failed to realize the danger, but that was soon to change. Over {{the next several days}} the squadron began a routine of three scheduled patrols, lasting about an hour each, and then three or four voluntary patrols each day. On 4 June, the squadron performed seven patrols with the object of keeping enemy observation photographers from coming over. [...] The squadron engaged in combat with the German Air Force on several patrols, and on 13 June, Lt Plyer was reported missing after being shot down in a combat with German planes, and later was reported to be a prisoner. In the days that followed, saw a continence of these same types of patrols. [...] On 25 June, orders came to be ready to move to the Chateau Thierry Sector.|$|E
2500|$|With Australia needing 377 runs {{to avoid}} an innings defeat Denness could afford to set an {{aggressive}} field, {{but to no avail}} as Redpath and McCosker made 32/0 when bad light stopped play. Peter Lever had caught a fever on the rest day and retired after three overs, to be replaced by Old and Greig. Though much of the pitch was flat the area around the damp patch of the first day was <b>pock-marked</b> and made the odd ball fly up and hit the hands of the batsmen, who were surrounded by slips, gullies and short-legs. McCosker took to hooking the ball over their heads and outscored Redpath so that when he edged Arnold (3/83) to Cowdrey for his 120th and last Test catch he mad made 76 of their 111 in 108 minutes. Redpath (83) added another century stand with Ian Chappell (50) until the captain glanced another catch to Knott off Grieg (4/88), but was unsatisfied with the decision and stayed to argue with the bowler and losing his temper in the process before leaving at 215/2. Greig caught Redpath at close short-leg, but the England appeals were turned down and in his next over the South African saw 12 runs scored while Greg Chappell gave three half-chances. After 335 minutes Redpath was out for 83, hitting the ball to Amiss at short-leg, who took a 'golden catch'. Soon after Ross Edwards appeared to be lbw, but much to the surprise of the commentary box was given not out, having caught a tiny edge as he moved across the ball. Denness delayed the taking of the new ball as he hoped to use it in the morning when Lever was better, but was forced to take it in the evening to no avail as Australia reach 273/3 with the local press proclaimed [...] "WE SAVED IT". Lever was back on the field, but it was Arnold who made the breakthrough, feeding Edwards his favourite leg-glance until he edged it behind his to Knott. The Surrey bowler then made the ball cut from leg to hit Walter's off stump. When Denness caught Marsh off a Lever out-swinger Australia were 306/6 and struggling, but Chappell made his seventh half-century of the series and with Walker took Australia to 360/6 by lunch. After the break the tail collapsed, Walker got above himself and drove the ball {{into the hands of the}} bowler Greig, Lever moved the ball back nine inches to bowl Chappell (102) just after he reach his second century of the series and Mallett, Dymock and the injured Lillee failed to make any runs and Australia were suddenly out for 373 with three hours to spare.|$|E

60|$|On one {{occasion}} he {{had succeeded in}} spying on the Chief Agent of the Committee of General Security, whom he knew by sight, while the latter was sitting at dinner {{in the company of}} a stout, florid man with <b>pock-marked</b> face and podgy hands covered with rings.|$|E
60|$|When {{they came}} close to the shore they saw an {{emaciated}} creature with scant white locks tangled and matted. The thin, bent body was naked but for a loin cloth. Tears were rolling down the sunken <b>pock-marked</b> cheeks. The man jabbered at them in a strange tongue.|$|E
60|$|This {{was met by}} a {{curdling}} yell of rage. A big Chinaman, remarkably evil-looking, {{with his}} head swathed in a yellow silk handkerchief and face badly <b>pock-marked,</b> planted a pike-pole on the Reindeer's bow and began to shove the entangled boats apart. Pausing long enough to let go the jib halyards, {{and just as the}} Reindeer cleared and began to drift astern, I leaped aboard the junk with a line and made fast. He of the yellow handkerchief and <b>pock-marked</b> face came toward me threateningly, but I put my hand into my hip pocket, and he hesitated. I was unarmed, but the Chinese have learned to be fastidiously careful of American hip pockets, and it was upon this that I depended to keep him and his savage crew at a distance.|$|E
60|$|The {{master of}} the John {{was a man of}} about fifty, red-faced, hard-looking, <b>pock-marked,</b> square-rigged, and of an {{exterior}} that promised anything but sentiment. Feeling, however, he did manifest, the moment I mentioned my father's name. He ceased his employment, came close to me, gazed earnestly in my face, and even looked kind.|$|E
60|$|Leading {{them came}} a big, muscular man, {{conspicuous}} for his <b>pock-marked</b> {{face and the}} yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head. It was Yellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal shrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at that time, had nearly sunk the Reindeer, as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of navigation.|$|E

60|$|Tarzan visited Akut the {{following}} day, but though Jack begged {{to be allowed}} to accompany him he was refused. This time Tarzan saw the <b>pock-marked</b> old owner of the ape, whom he did not recognize as the wily Paulvitch of former days. Tarzan, influenced by Akut's pleadings, broached the question of the ape's purchase; but Paulvitch would not name any price, saying that he would consider the matter.|$|E
60|$|Paulvitch carried {{another piece}} of cord in his hand. There was a noose in one end of it which he was {{continually}} playing with. He walked back and forth, {{up and down the}} room. His <b>pock-marked</b> features were working horribly as he talked silent to himself. The boy had never seen him thus--it made him uneasy. At last Paulvitch stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the room, far from the ape.|$|E
60|$|During this {{rattling}} talk, John had {{fixed his}} eyes on the face of one of the passengers who sat opposite to him. The stranger appeared to be about fifty years of age, strongly <b>pock-marked,</b> with a stiff military air, and had the dress and exterior of a gentlemen. His face was much sun-burnt, though naturally very fair; and his dark keen eye was intently fixed on the sailor as he continued his remarks.|$|E

6000|$|It was Sunday {{and all my}} {{aunts and}} uncles were in holiday dress and a merry, hearty, {{handsome}} group they were. One of the men helped my mother out and another, a roguish young fellow with a <b>pock-marked</b> face, snatched me from the wagon and carried me under his arm to the threshold where a short, gray-haired smiling woman was standing. [...] "Mother, here's another grandson for you," [...] {{he said as he}} put me at her feet.|$|E
6000|$|Sue {{turned her}} head and saw an ill-favoured man, closely cropped, with a broad-faced, <b>pock-marked</b> woman on his arm, ruddy with liquor and the {{satisfaction}} {{of being on the}} brink of a gratified desire. They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and went forward in front of Jude and Sue, whose diffidence was increasing.

6000|$|Looking at him {{now with}} interest, Andre-Louis {{wondered}} {{how it came}} that all, or nearly all the leading innovators, were <b>pock-marked.</b> Mirabeau, the journalist Desmoulins, the philanthropist Marat, Robespierre the little lawyer from Arras, this formidable fellow Danton, and several others he could call to mind all bore upon them the scars of smallpox. Almost he began to wonder was there any connection between the two. Did an attack of smallpox produce certain moral results which found expression in this way? ...|$|E
6000|$|Shadowy in his tricorne {{and old-fashioned}} clothes, like a bowed, thin ghost of the ancien regime, the Chevalier voiced a ghostly memory. [...] "I can {{remember}} the feud about little Sophie Derval, between Monsieur de Brissac, Captain in the Bodyguards, and d'Anjorrant (not the <b>pock-marked</b> one, the other--the Beau d'Anjorrant, as they called him).

60|$|I strayed {{round to}} where the headstones, from their {{eminence}} leaned to look on the Hall below, where great windows shone yellow light on to the flagged court-yard, and the little fish pool. A stone staircase descended from the graveyard to the court, between stone balustrades whose <b>pock-marked</b> grey columns still swelled gracefully and with dignity, encrusted with lichens. The staircase was filled with ivy and rambling roses—impassable. Ferns were unrolling round the big square halting place, half way down where the stairs turned.|$|E
6000|$|... [p.70] water-camel in front, {{so as to}} {{exercise}} due supervision. Shaykh Mas’ud and his son made only an occasional reference to the skins. But his nephew, a short, thin, <b>pock-marked</b> lad of eighteen, whose black skin and woolly head suggested {{the idea of a}} semi-African and ignoble origin, was always drinking; except when he climbed the camel’s back, and, dozing upon the damp load, forgot his thirst. In vain we ordered, we taunted, and we abused him: he would drink, he would sleep, but he would not work.|$|E
