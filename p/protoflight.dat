40|$|The NASA <b>Protoflight</b> Research Initiative is an {{internal}} NASA study conducted within the Office of the Chief Engineer {{to better understand}} the use of <b>Protoflight</b> within NASA. Extensive literature reviews and interviews with key NASA members with experience in both robotic and human spaceflight missions has resulted in three main conclusions and two observations. The first conclusion is that NASA's <b>Protoflight</b> method is not considered to be "prescriptive. " The current policies and guidance allows each Program/Project to tailor the <b>Protoflight</b> approach to better meet their needs, goals and objectives. Second, Risk Management {{plays a key role in}} implementation of the <b>Protoflight</b> approach. Any deviations from full qualification will be based on the level of acceptable risk with guidance found in NPR 8705. 4. Finally, over the past decade (2004 - 2014) only 6 % of NASA's <b>Protoflight</b> missions and 6 % of NASA's Full qualification missions experienced a publicly disclosed mission failure. In other words, the data indicates that the <b>Protoflight</b> approach, in and of it itself, does not increase the mission risk of in-flight failure. The first observation is that it would be beneficial to document the decision making process on the implementation and use of <b>Protoflight.</b> The second observation is that If a Project/Program chooses to use the <b>Protoflight</b> approach with relevant heritage, it is extremely important that the Program/Project Manager ensures that the current project's requirements falls within the heritage design, component, instrument and/or subsystem's requirements for both the planned and operational use, and that the documentation of the relevant heritage is comprehensive, sufficient and the decision well documented. To further benefit/inform this study, a recommendation to perform a deep dive into 30 missions with accessible data on their testing/verification methodology and decision process to research the differences between <b>Protoflight</b> and Full Qualification missions' Design Requirements and Verification & Validation (V&V) (without any impact or special request directly to the project) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{road map}} for the {{development}} of a <b>protoflight</b> 32 GHz spacecraft solid state transmitter is given. The major milestones include the development of device and component technology required for use in the spaceborne experimental and operational transmitter systems. Two experimental spacecraft transmitter systems are envisioned: first, a low power beacon, to determine the performance of a 32 GHz downlink communications system; and second, an array feed, to further verify the results of the first experiment and service as a test bed for technology required for an operational system. The first experiment was proposed to NASA Headquarters for flight aboard the Mars Observer spacecraft with spacecraft integration in early 1989. The second is to be available for integration aboard a spacecraft such as the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission in the 1990 time frame.

40|$|The JWST IEC {{conformal}} shields {{are mounted}} onto a composite frame structure that must undergo qualification testing to satisfy mission assurance requirements. The composite frame segments are bonded {{together at the}} joints using epoxy, EA 9394. The development of a test method to verify {{the integrity of the}} bonded structure at its operating environment introduces challenges in terms of requirements definition and the attainment of success criteria. Even though <b>protoflight</b> thermal requirements were not achieved, the first attempt in exposing the structure to cryogenic operating conditions in a thermal vacuum environment resulted in approximately 1 bonded joints failure during mechanical pull tests performed at 1. 25 times the flight loads. Failure analysis concluded that the failure mode was due to adhesive cracks that formed and propagated along stress concentrated fillets as a result of poor bond squeeze-out control during fabrication. Bond repairs were made and the structures successfully re-tested with an improved LN 2 immersion test method to achieve <b>protoflight</b> thermal requirements...|$|E
40|$|SAX {{satellite}} verification {{is based}} on a <b>protoflight</b> approach, in which only one system model is realized at flight standard level, taking into account the utilization of hardware already qualified for other space programs and the necessity to respect the schedule constraints for a scientific objective. In any case, this approach was tailored with some deviations in order to reduce risks inherent in such a choice. The <b>protoflight</b> approach was also pursued at subsystem/unit level in particular for those subsystems and units considered critical from the schedule point of view. Payload Instruments followed the same approach but complete spare units were developed to reduce the risks associated with such an approach. A description of the model philosophy is provided and then, at satellite level, the testing approach and rationale for each model is presented.

The simulated LANDSAT- 4 scanner outputs were 3 to 10 percent lower in the red band and 3 to 11 percent higher in the first near-IR band than previous scanners for the soybeans targets. The LANDSAT- 4 scanners were generally more uniform from channel to channel within bands than previous scanners. In the upper-band edge of the red band of the <b>protoflight</b> scanner, one channel was markedly different (12 nm) from the rest.

40|$|During solar eclipse, {{spacecraft}} rely on batteries {{to power}} all on-board electrical systems. Advances in battery technology have lead to lighter products that, in turn, allow spacecraft to fly heavier and more capable payloads. AEA Technology has pioneered {{the current state}} of the art in the space community 1 : Lithium-ion battery technology. Traditionally space batteries were composed of a single series connected string of cells. The cells are sized (in terms of capacity) according to mission requirements and so cell qualification programmes for individual missions are common. The small cell approach involves taking Commercially available Off The Shelf (COTS) Lithium-ion cells, qualifying the design for space, and using a strict Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) process to ensure the continued quality of cell batches for space flight. The technology has proved to be ideal for small satellite missions due to the low-cost of small cell battery designs compared to rival large cell energy storage solutions. The maturity of the design concept, and therefore low risk of utilisation, allows <b>Protoflight</b> programmes to be adopted for all but the most specialised of applications. A <b>protoflight</b> programme reduces cost due to the lack of need for a dedicated qualification battery unit and test programme...|$|E

The solar panels developed is based on “low-cost” and “low-tech” techniques for assembly and qualification. The approach adopted involves {{a printed circuit board}} where bare cells are installed by means of a double-sided insulating adhesive tape and each cell is covered with cerium doped borosilicate glass, using a controlled volatility silicone. Bonding was performed with a dedicated vacuum bag technique, developed in-house. This method allows to achieve a significant cost reduction with respect to traditional techniques, while retaining high performance and avoiding complex technological procedures during the integration. The panels were subjected to electrical characterization and to thermal vacuum test according to ECSS standards. We outline the panel design, the manufacturing processes and the results of electrical and thermal vacuum tests carried out on the <b>protoflight</b> model. The recorded <b>protoflight</b> unit total mass loss was well under the acceptable limits, so the panel has been accepted for space flight.
