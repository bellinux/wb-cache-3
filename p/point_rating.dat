50|$|Berryman QPRS, {{also known}} as the Berryman Quality <b>Point</b> <b>Rating</b> System is a {{mathematical}} rating system developed by Clyde P. Berryman to rate sports teams and competitors. The Berryman QPRS system considers strength of schedule, win-loss record, points scored, and points allowed. Berryman applied his QPRS system to select college football national champions on a current basis from 1990 to 2011. He also applied the QPRS system retroactively to select national champions for each year from 1920 to 1989. The Berryman QPRS is one of the rating systems used to select historic national champions that is recognized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in its Football Bowl Subdivision record book.|$|E

5000|$|The average {{standard}} is 1.000. The bottom is [...]000. To earn a 2.000 rating, a passer must perform at exceptional levels, i.e., 70 percent in completions, 10 percent in touchdowns, 1.5 percent ininterceptions, and 11 yards average gain per pass attempt. In {{order to make}} the rating more understandable, the <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> is then converted into a scale of 100, with 158.3 being thehighest rating a passer can achieve. In cases where statistical performance has been superior, it is possible for a passer to surpass a 100 rating.

Most items use a three <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> scale for severity (not present, subthreshold, and threshold—which combines both moderate and severe presentations). It has been used with preschool as well as school-aged children.

5000|$|To better {{understand}} and track psychological well-being, Ishizuka broke down the self, intimacy and achievement spheres into three dimensions with nine elements each.

[...] This tripod model of mental health {{is the basis for}} Lifetrack Therapy, a clinical approach drawing on the experience and insights accumulated by the daily self-rating data of more than 1,200 patients throughout their treatment on 41 parameters of mental health through periods of crisis to optimal health. [...] The central goal for both the ‘distressed” and the “well” in Lifetrack Therapy is the same: health and well-being in the primary three spheres of life.

5000|$|For an {{individual}} to become happier or to grow {{in a short period}} of time there needs to be a means for him or her to actively think, feel and act in ways that foster positive mental health. In the experience of Lifetrack, the ability to improve the subjective world far beyond a previous best requires an active focus of one's mental states throughout therapy. Ishizuka has found that using simple definitions of positive mental health as the objective of therapy and a subjective 10 <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> scale, one can track subjective responses to life events. For example, if you depend on your spouse or significant other at only a 5 on a 10-point scale, that implies that you can think, feel and act in ways that allow you to more graciously depend." [...] With his patients taking five to ten minutes daily to track self, intimacy and achievement spheres, as well as positive peaks of well-being (peace, friendliness, physical-health, happiness, mastery), negative peaks (anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression, psychosis), physical health, and proper use of food, beverage, or other substances, focus on incremental thinking, feeling and acting is encouraged. In therapy, Ishizuka actively uses setbacks as a means to promote growth in the three spheres. Together, the therapist and the patient use the definition of positive mental health and the subjective daily rating of the patient in 41 mental health parameters to focus weekly therapy sessions on overcoming setbacks and building health beyond a previous best level of adjustment.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{some of the}} criteria used in selecting Naval Academy graduates for entry into the Navy's Nuclear Power Program. Data from 1, 096 Naval Academy graduates who attended Nuclear Power School (NPS) between 1997 and 2003 is analyzed using hierarchal linear regressions. Two models {{are used in the}} study. In the first model the independent variables are major type, service community assigned, and Order of Merit (class rank). In the second model the independent variables are major type, service community assigned, Cumulative Academic Quality <b>Point</b> <b>rating</b> (CAQPR), Technical Quality <b>Point</b> <b>Rating</b> (TQPR), and Military Quality <b>Point</b> <b>Rating</b> (MQPR). The dependant variable in both models is Nuclear Power School grade point average. The study found that the more engineering based and officer's major was at the Academy the better they perform at NPS. It also finds that officers assigned to the Surface Warfare-Nuclear community perform slightly better than those assigned to the Submarine community. Lastly, the strongest predictor examined is the variable that measures general cognitive ability. Order of Merit and CAQPR are the strongest predictors of NPS GPA in their respective models. TQPR is a weak predictor of NPS GPA and MQPR is negatively related to performance at NPS. US Navy (USN) author...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1978. EducationBibliography : leaves 81 - 89. The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if participation in educational decision-making affected teacher productivity and teacher satisfaction. The Data collection took place in April and May, 1976, using a six part questionnaire. Twenty-five high schools were randomly selected along the east coast of Newfoundland. This represented a total teacher sample of three hundred and fifty-eight. In all, two hundred and eighty, or 78. 2 percent, responded. [...] The data analyses consisted of factor analyses and Pearson product-moment correlations. The two hypotheses tested were: [...] 1. There is an inverse relationship between friction <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> (FPR) identified by teachers and their Job Satisfaction. [...] 2. An inverse relationship exists between friction <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> (FPR) and Teacher Productivity. [...] The results of the bivariate analyses were negative; therefore, both hypotheses were rejected. However, the study revealed four major findings. They may be summarized as follows: (1) Three friction point areas emerged: classroom management, curriculum, and staff hiring and evaluation. (2) A teacher’s effort is significantly related to his intrinsic commitment to teaching. (3) There was a significant relationship between the friction <b>point</b> <b>rating</b> in the area of curriculum and a person’s satisfaction. Finally, (4) there was a significant relationship between a person’s self concept of his teaching ability and the friction point area classroom management...|$|E
