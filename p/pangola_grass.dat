50|$|Pasture {{areas are}} small, {{covering}} some 2.7% of the islands. <b>Pangola</b> and Bermuda <b>grasses</b> provide {{the bulk of}} the fodder. Estimates of livestock in 2001 were sheep, 14,000; goats, 14,400; cattle, 4,300 head; and pigs, 4,000.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict the energy value and dynamic {{degradation}} of roughage in Taiwan using the Daisy(R) in vitro fermentation method to provide information on one of the very important nutrients for ration formulation. The second objective was to study the effects of Aspergillus oryzae (AFE) inclusion on nutrient utilization. Three ruminal fistulated dry dairy cows were used for rumen fluid and fifteen conventional forages used in dairy cattle were collected around this island. The degradability of these feedstuffs with and without AFE (Amaferm(R)) treatment was measured using the Daisy(R) in vitro method. The roughage energy values, including TDN and NEL, were calculated according to Robinson (2000). Results from the 30 h in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradability and predicted energy evaluations showed that alfalfa (among the forages) contained the highest degradability and energy values, Bermuda straw having the lowest. Peanut vines and corn silage contained higher energy values and the lowest value found in <b>Pangola</b> and Napier <b>grasses</b> among the locally produced forages. <b>Pangola</b> and Napier <b>grasses</b> had lower values than most imported forages except Bermuda straw. Among the by-products, wheat middling contained the highest NDF degradability, while rice bran contained the richest energy value due to its high oil content. From the dynamic dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation, corn silage contained the highest effective degradation among the local forages; wheat middling (among the by-products) degraded the fastest in DM, OM, ADF and NDF and showed the highest effective degradability. AFE inclusion was inconsistent among the forages. Alfalfa hay showed significantly increased 30 h NDF degradability and energy values, <b>Pangola</b> hay, Napier <b>grass</b> and brewer's grains showed decreased degradability and energy values. AFE inclusion increased the DM, OM and NDF degradation rate in most forage, but only increased the DM degradation rate in sorghum distiller's grains, the OM degradation rate in bean curd pomace and the NDF and ADF degradation rates in soy pomace (among the by-products) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{management}} of P. phaseoloides [...] grown in mixtures is challenging. P. phaseoloides often shows a high palatability compared to tropical grasses and hence under high grazing pressure it can disappear. If the grazing pressure {{is too low}} it can become dominating due to its fast growth and its climbing ability. Its growth is also affected by the other species in the mixture. It grows well with ori, molasses, guinea and napier grass. However it cannot persist when grown with Brachiaria decumbens or <b>pangola</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
30|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{introduction}} and investigation of <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> as a tropical forage species especially in Thailand. <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (Digitaria eriantha Steud., synonym D. decumbens) is one of recent examples of grasses that have been successfully introduced to Southeast Asia and is often considered {{as one of the}} highest quality tropical grasses popularly grown as pasture. <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> is utilized extensively as grass for animal grazing, hay and silage making. Its crude protein content is commonly in the order of 5 to 14 % of dry matter and may exceed 15 % of dry matter with young regrowth under high fertilization. It has been documented that the type and number of ruminants receiving <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> can determine the success of its use. Results obtained when <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> in fresh, hay or silage form was fed to ruminant animals as supplements showed better performances in body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, carcass yield, meat quality, and milk yield and composition. In conclusion, <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> is a promising forage and a source of high quality feed for ruminant animals in tropical countries.|$|E
30|$|The {{future of}} <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> as basal {{roughage}} or supplement in the diets of ruminant animals {{seems to be}} very promising but requires long term plans. <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> is a good source of forage and can be fed fresh or preserved as hay or silage. Thus, pangola is {{regarded as one of the}} most digestible and highest quality tropical grasses and expected to be good feed for ruminant animals.|$|E
30|$|Three {{cultivation}} substrates {{were tested}} {{using the following}} agricultural byproducts obtained from local markets: (1) <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (Digitaria decumbens) cut into 2 – 2.5  cm lengths, (2) corncob (Zea mays) cut into 1 – 2  cm lengths, and (3) a mixture of wood shavings of the primavera tree (Tabebuia rosea) (16.6 %), with corncob (41.6 %) and <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (41.6 %). These substrates were combined with 2 % hydrated lime Ca(OH) 2 (Super Cal hidratada Grijalva), and the moisture was adjusted to 65 % with tap water.|$|E
30|$|In vitro {{data were}} only {{reported}} by Regan (2000) and Juárez Reyes et al. (2009). Regan (2000) {{reported that in}} northern Australia bale silage was prepared from wilted pasture with <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (Digitaria eriantha subsp. eriantha) and two legumes, namely cavalcade centurion (Centrosema pascuorum) and wynn cassia (Chamaecrista rotundifolia). The DM content of the silages made from the wilted plants ranged from 42 – 57 %, the in vitro digestibility from 55.0 - 58.0 % and the estimated metabolizable energy concentration from 8.5 - 9.0  MJ/kg DM. Juárez Reyes et al. (2009) reported higher in vitro gas production (P[*]<[*] 0.05) for <b>pangola</b> <b>grass,</b> compared with 30 % less gas in other grasses (Guinea, Bermuda and Tanzania grasses). They also reported greater (P[*]<[*] 0.05) in vitro gas production and insoluble but slowly degradable (b) fraction of <b>pangola</b> <b>grass,</b> as well as lower b fraction in Guinea and Bermuda grasses.|$|E
30|$|Ruminal {{disorder}} or toxicity was {{not found}} in sheep, goat, beef cattle and dairy cattle. However, in horse grazing pangola pastures, cases of bighead disease (nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by interference of oxalate in <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> with mineral utilization in horses) have been recorded (Stewart et al. 2010). In suitable environments, <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> – through improved intake and digestibility – can support better ruminant performance in terms of milk yield and composition, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and meat quality than most other introduced pasture grasses in the Tropics.|$|E
40|$|Silages were {{prepared}} from the tropical grasses, <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (Digitaria decumbens) and setaria (Setaria sphacelata), {{with the addition}} of molasses (4 % w/w) and/or leaves (33 %) from the leguminous trees leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland farm in south eastern Queensland during 1985. These silages, together with hays made from these grasses and sorghum silage (13 diets) were fed to sheep to assess their nutritive value. All silages were well preserved, as indicated by low pH (3. 5 - 4. 4) low ammonia N (26 – 57 g/kg total N) and high lactic acid (73 – 95 % total acids) contents. The addition of legumes increased both the dry matter (DM) and total N (TN) contents of silages to the same extent as the addition of both legumes and molasses at ensiling. Sheep given silages prepared from <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> and legumes (molasses) consumed similar DM intakes (22. 9 - 25. 4 g/kgper day) as sheep given <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> hay (23. 9 g/kgper day). Silage made from <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> + molasses was of low palatability (161 g/kgper day). The digestibilities of silage DM (DMD) and its fibrous components were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower (DMD 53. 3 - 60. 6 %) than that of pangola hay (DMD 64. 7 %). Silages and hay made from setaria, and sorghum silage, were of lower nutritive value than those from <b>pangola</b> <b>grass.</b> The addition of leucaena and molasses increased silage DM intakes (21 – 1 g/kgper day) above those for setaria hay and setaria + molasses silage (16. 7 and 19. 0 g/kgper day respectively).

40|$|Feed intake, rumen function, {{microbial}} protein (MCP) {{production and}} the efficiency of MCP production were determined in steers fed four different forage hays varying markedly in crude protein content. Low quality tropical forage (speargrass and Mitchell grass) hays had lower crude protein content, higher neutral detergent fibre content and lower digestibility than a medium quality tropical forage (<b>pangola</b> <b>grass)</b> hay and a temperate forage (ryegrass) hay. Steers fed speargrass and Mitchell grass hays had lower MCP production (80 and 170 g MCP/day, respectively) and efficiency of MCP production [78 and 79 g MCP/kg digestible organic matter (DOM), respectively] than steers fed <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> (328 g MCP/day; 102 g MCP/kg DOM) and ryegrass (627 g MCP/day; 135 g MCP/kg DOM) hays, which was {{directly related to the}} supply of DOM and rumen degradable protein.

In Experiment 2, test substrates were incubated in polyester bags in the rumen of steers fed speargrass hay supplemented with urea and ammonium sulfate (US), branched-chain amino acids with US (USAA), casein, cottonseed meal, yeast and Chlorella algae in a 7 by 3 incomplete Latin-square design. In Experiment 3, test substrates were incubated in polyester bags in the rumen of steers fed Mitchell grass hay supplemented with increasing amounts of US or Spirulina algae (Spirulina platensis). The test substrates used in all experiments were speargrass, Mitchell grass, <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> or ryegrass hays. Digestion rate of the ryegrass substrate was higher than that of the speargrass substrate (P < 0. 05) in Experiment 1. Supplementation with various N sources increased the degradation rate and effective degradability of all incubated substrates above that apparent in Control steers (P < 0. 05; Experiment 2). Supplementation of US and Spirulina increased degradation rate and effective degradability of ryegrass, <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> and Mitchell grass substrates above that apparent in Control steers (P < 0. 05; Experiment 3). However, there was no further response on digestion rate of the substrates in increasing supplementation levels either for US or Spirulina. In conclusion, rate of digestion was affected by forage physical and anatomical properties.

One bag in each of T 11 and T 12 were also about 20 % contaminated with the same mold by the end of the first harvest, which would explain the low mushroom production recorded with these two supplements (soybean and wheat bran alone). The general incidence of contamination by Trichoderma sp was 6.6 % in Supplementation Trial 1, and the fact that contamination appeared only in some bags of the last treatments suggests it occurred during spawning.

In the Philippines and Indonesia, leucaena was widely promoted as a livestock feed. Although these grass and legume species are competing with each other, direct comparisons of both agronomic performance and feeding value are missing and are thus encouraged.|$|E
30|$|Results {{of studies}} {{involving}} pangola varied widely {{depending on the}} form of its presentation and species of animal. The general conclusion is that supplementation of <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> in fresh or preserved (hay and silage) forms to ruminant animals showed beneficial results. Ranchers in Central and South Florida have been well served for many years by ‘pangola’ and other cultivars of digit grass. Pangola is a very palatable grass that is readily consumed by livestock (beef, dairy cattle and horses) as grazed pasture or hay (Vendramini et al. 2012). In the following paragraphs, results are summarized from studies involving in vivo and in vitro measurements and these are separately presented.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} if the self-heating pasteurization procedure is technically applicable to the cultivation of Agaricus bisporus. Firstly the substrates alone (corncob, <b>Pangola</b> <b>grass</b> and a mixture of both ingredients with wood shavings) were tested. Two supplementation trials were then undertaken using soybean, wheat bran, sheep manure, sesame seed, black bean and chia. Highest production values (BE =  176.3 % and Y =  26.6  kg/m 2) were obtained using a 9 % supplement, with a formula consisting of 25 % each of soybean, black bean, wheat bran and chia, added at spawning and at casing. These results were comparable to those obtained with the Phase II compost traditionally used for A. bisporus cultivation.|$|E
30|$|Some authors studied {{effects of}} pangola on growth of ruminants. In Taiwan, Hsieh (1990) used four {{tropical}} grasses (pangola, Guinea, dwarf elephant and South African pigeon grass) which were grazed by seven Holstein steers {{during the first}} year and 60 Nubian-native goat hybrids during the second year. Pangola gave the highest average daily gain (ADG) for cattle, while Guinea grass was the second highest. At Parada in North Queensland, Australia, a body weight gain of 2, 990  kg/(ha × year) was obtained from grazing irrigated <b>pangola</b> <b>grass</b> fertilized with 672  kg N/(ha × year); (Ebersohn and Lee 1972). In Jamaica, Creek and Nestel (1965) found that pangola grazed at 32 -day intervals produced more DM and more body weight gain than when grazed at 40 -day intervals.|$|E
