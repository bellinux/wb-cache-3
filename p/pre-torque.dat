30|$|The set-up {{consists}} of two beams of length 1  m each connected to a central column of height 650  mm. The beams and column were made of Universal Beam (UB) steel sections  306.6  ×  165.7  ×  11.8  ×  6.7  ×  46.1 of ultimate tensile strength of 410  MPa. Indian Standard angle of size ISA 65  ×  65  ×  6 and length of 180  mm is used as double web angle. An air-gap distance of 10  mm is provided between beam and column. The test specimen is given the id DWA- 6 - 180, in which 6 represents the thickness of angle in mm and 180 is the length of angle in mm. In order to simulate the simply supported conditions, {{one side of the}} beam was supported on hinge and other on roller. High-strength friction grip (HSFG) bolts of 16  mm diameter and 8.8 grade were used to connect the ends of beam web to the central stub column. The bolts were tightened by a <b>pre-torque</b> of 214  Nm. The present set-up has the advantage that column does not rotate, but only displaces up and down and the relative rotation between the column and beam is mainly due to connection deformation. Dial gauges of least count 0.01  mm were placed at every quarter effective span of the beam to measure the deflection. Strain gauges were pasted at various locations to measure the strain variation. Inclinometer was used to measure the relative rotation between the beam and column. The load was applied over the centre of the stub column {{with the help of a}} 60  T capacity hydraulic jack. Dial gauge, inclinometer and strain gauge readings are noted periodically up to collapse load.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} and compare "in vitro" the maximum friction force generated by {{three types of}} esthetic brackets, two types of polycrystalline conventional ceramic brackets (20 / 40 and InVu) and one type of sapphire monocrystalline bracket (Radiance) in dry and artificial saliva wet settings. Also, to evaluate the influence exerted by artificial saliva on the friction forces of those brackets. METHODS: Tests were performed in dry and artificial saliva wet setting (Oral Balance) by using an EMIC DL 10000 testing machine, simulating a 2 mm slide of 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in rectangular stainless steel wires over the pre-angulated and <b>pre-torqued</b> (right superior canine, Roth prescription, slot 0. 022 x 0. 030 -in) brackets (n = 18 for each bracket). In order to compare groups in dry and wet settings, the ANOVA was used. For comparisons related to the dry versus wet setting, the student t test was used for each group. RESULTS: The results showed that {{in the absence of}} saliva the Radiance monocrystalline brackets showed the highest friction coefficients, followed by the 20 / 40 and the InVu polycrystalline brackets. In tests with artificial saliva, the Radiance and the 20 / 40 brackets had statistically similar friction coefficients and both were greater than that presented by the InVu brackets. The artificial saliva did not change the maximum friction force of the Radiance brackets, but, for the others (20 / 40 and InVu), an increase of friction was observed in its presence. CONCLUSION: The InVu brackets showed, in the absence and in the presence of saliva, the lowest friction coefficient...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} fracture response of aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes under internal gaseous detonation loading {{has been carried}} out. The pressure load, with speeds exceeding 2 km/s, {{can be characterized as}} a pressure peak (ranging from 2 to 6 MPa) followed by an expansion wave. The unique combination of this particular traveling load and tube geometry produced fracture data not available before in the open literature. Experimental data of this type are useful for studying the fluid-structure-fracture interaction and various crack curving and branching phenomena, and also for validation for multi-physics and multi-scale modeling. Axial surface flaws were introduced to control the crack initiation site. Fracture threshold models were developed by combining a static fracture model and an extensively studied dynamic amplification factor for tubes under internal traveling loads. Experiments were also performed on hydrostatically loaded preflawed aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes for comparison. Significantly different fracture behavior was observed and the difference was explained by fluid dynamics and energy considerations. The experiments yielded comparison on crack speeds, strain, and pressure histories. In other experiments, the specimens were also <b>pre-torqued</b> to control the propagation direction of the cracks. Measurements were made on the detonation velocity, strain history, blast pressure from the crack opening, and crack speeds. The curved crack paths were digitized. The Chapman-Jouguet pressure, initial axial flaw length, and torsion level were varied to obtain different crack patterns. The incipient crack kinking angle was found to be consistent with fracture under mixed-mode loading. High-speed movies of the fracture events and blast wave were taken and these were used in interpreting the quantitative data. Numerical simulations were performed using the commercial explicit finite-element software LS-Dyna. The detonation wave was modeled as a traveling boundary load. Both non-fracturing linear elastic simulations and elastoplastic simulations with fracture were conducted on three-dimensional models. The simulated fracture was compared directly with an experiment with the same conditions. The overall qualitative fracture behavior was captured by the simulation. The forward and backward cracks were observed to branch in both the experiment and simulation...|$|R

OBJETIVO: avaliar e comparar in vitro as cargas máximas de atrito geradas por três tipos de braquetes estéticos, sendo dois deles cerâmicos policristalinos convencionais (20 / 40 e InVu) e um monocristalino de safira (Radiance), em ambientes seco e umedecido por saliva artificial. Também avaliar a influência exercida pela saliva artificial sobre as cargas de atrito dos referidos braquetes. MÉTODOS: os ensaios foram realizados em ambiente seco e em ambiente umedecido com saliva artificial em gel (Oral Balance), utilizando uma máquina de ensaios mecânicos (EMIC, modelo DL 10000), simulando um deslizamento de 2 mm de fios retangulares 0, 019 " x 0, 025 " de aço sobre os braquetes (n = 18, para cada braquete), pré-angulados e pré-torqueados (canino superior direito prescrição Roth, slot 0, 022 " x 0, 030 "). Para comparação entre os braquetes, em ambiente seco ou umedecido, utilizou-se a análise de variância; e para a comparação dos braquetes em ambiente seco e umedecido, utilizou-se o teste t para amostras independentes. RESULTADOS: os resultados obtidos indicaram que, na ausência de saliva, os braquetes monocristalinos Radiance demonstraram o maior coeficiente de atrito, seguidos pelos braquetes policristalinos 20 / 40 e InVu. Nos ensaios realizados em ambiente umedecido, os braquetes Radiance e 20 / 40 apresentaram coeficientes de atrito estatisticamente semelhantes, e superiores ao apresentado pelos braquetes InVu. A saliva artificial não promoveu alterações na força máxima de atrito para os braquetes Radiance; todavia, para os demais (20 / 40 e InVu), promoveu aumento significativo nos coeficientes de atrito. CONCLUSÃO: os braquetes InVu apresentaram, tanto nos ensaios realizados na ausência, quanto na presença de saliva, os menores coeficientes de atrito, entre os braquetes ensaiados...|$|R
