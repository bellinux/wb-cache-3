40|$|Symmetry {{breaking}} {{is involved}} in many developmental processes that form bodies and organs. One {{of them is the}} epithelial rotation of developing tubular and acinar organs. However, how epithelial cells move, how they break symmetry to define their common direction, and what function rotational epithelial motions have remains elusive. Here, we identify a dynamic actomyosin network that breaks symmetry at the basal surface of the Drosophila follicle epithelium of acinar-like <b>primitive</b> <b>organs,</b> called egg chambers, and may represent a candidate force-generation mechanism that underlies the unidirectional motion of this epithelial tissue. We provide evidence that the atypical cadherin Fat 2, a key planar cell polarity regulator in Drosophila oogenesis, directs and orchestrates transmission of the intracellular actomyosin asymmetry cue onto a tissue plane in order to break planar actomyosin symmetry, facilitate epithelial rotation in the opposite direction, and direct the elongation of follicle cells. In contrast, loss of this rotational motion results in anisotropic non-muscle Myosin II pulses that are disorganized in plane and causes cell deformations in the epithelial tissue of Drosophila eggs. Our work demonstrates that atypical cadherins {{play an important role in}} the control of symmetry breaking of cellular mechanics in order to facilitate tissue motion and model epithelial tissue. We propose that their functions may be evolutionarily conserved in tubular/acinar vertebrate organs...|$|E

40|$|Tropomyosins (TMs) {{comprise}} {{a family of}} actin-binding proteins which {{play an important role}} in the regulation of contractility in muscle (cardiac, skeletal, and smooth) and nonmuscle cells. Although they are present in all cells, different isoforms are characteristic of specific cell types. In vertebrates, there are four different TM genes (alpha-TM, beta-TM, TM 30, and TM 4), three of which generate alternatively spliced isoforms. This study defines the expression patterns of these isoforms during murine embryogenesis, using both in vivo and in vitro conditions. The embryonic stem cell culture system, which has been shown to mimic different stages of mouse embryonic development, including the differentiation of <b>primitive</b> <b>organ</b> systems such as the myocardium, is used for our in vitro analysis. Our results demonstrate that several TM isoforms are expressed in specific developmental patterns, often correlated with the differentiation of particular tissues or organs. Surprisingly, other TMs, such as the striated muscle beta-TM and smooth muscle alpha-TM, are expressed constitutively. This study also demonstrates that there is an excellent correlation between the expression patterns of the TM isoforms observed in developing embryonic stem cells and mouse embryos. In addition, a quantitative molecular analysis of TM isoforms was conducted in embryonic, neonatal, and adult cardiac tissue. Our results show for the first time that the alpha- and beta-TM striated muscle transcripts are present in the earliest functional stages of the heart, and these TM isoforms are identical to those present throughout cardiac development...|$|R

40|$|Recent phylogenetic {{studies have}} implied that all plants {{able to enter}} root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} {{go back to a}} common ancestor (D. E. Soltis, P. S.

However, nodules formed by plants from different groups are distinct in nodule organogenesis and structure. In most groups, nodule organogenesis involves the induction of cortical cell divisions. In legumes these divisions lead to the formation of a nodule primordium, while in non-legumes they lead to the formation of a so-called prenodule consisting of infected and uninfected cells. Nodule primordium formation does not involve prenodule cells, and the function of prenodules is not known. Here, we examine the differentiation of actinorhizal prenodule cells in comparison to nodule cells with regard to both symbionts. Our findings indicate that prenodules represent <b>primitive</b> symbiotic <b>organs</b> whose cell types display the same characteristics as their nodule counterparts.

2500|$|As in legumes, {{nodulation}} {{is favored}} by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a root hair and {{is followed by the}} formation of a <b>primitive</b> symbiotic <b>organ</b> lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of rat lung from a <b>primitive</b> gas-exchange <b>organ</b> to the mature respiratory organ is {{in large part}} a postnatal phenomenon that has been well characterized by morphological and morphometric methods. The alveolarization of the lung is achieved during the first 3 weeks of life. Cholinergic innervation of rat lung also appears postnatally. We have monitored the presence or activity of several proteins during postnatal rat lung development. Newborn-rat lung contains negligible amounts of acetylcholinesterase, but the specific activity of acetylcholinesterase reaches adult values by postnatal day 10 – 11. Neonatal-rat lung does not contain significant amounts of β-galactoside-binding protein [Powell (1980) Biochem. J. 187, 123 – 129]. The activity of this endogenous lung lectin was apparent at about day 6, was maximal between days 10 and 13 before declining 8 – 10 -fold to reach adult values. Elastin has been implicated from morphological evidence as critical to lung restructuring. We have quantified the amount of desmosine and isodesmosine per g wet wt. of lung. The concentration of elastin, by this criterion, was low and stationary until postnatal day 7; {{a dramatic increase in}} elastin concentration occurred between days 10 and 20, when adult values were reached.

30|$|The {{origin of}} vertebrate-specific {{characters}} and functional systems {{is one of}} the most important questions in the evolutionary biology (Holland and Chen, 2001). Amphioxus, the most basal chordate, is considered as the sister of vertebrates based on the recent molecular phylogenetic evidences, and it is used as an ideal model organism to study the origin and evolution of vertebrate organ systems including immune system (Yu and Holland, 2009). Three digestive organs, gill slits, hepatic caecum and intestine in amphioxus were also considered as <b>primitive</b> immune <b>organs</b> of amphioxus (Schmitz et al., 2000). In addition to the respiratory and digestive function, the amphioxus gill is regarded as “the first immune defense organ” and plays a natural immune defense role by working as a physical barrier. The intestine is serving as a site of continuous immunological interaction (Yuan et al., 2015). Meanwhile, the hepatic caecum of amphioxus, as a prototype of the vertebrate liver, is also considered as a potential immunological organ in the amphioxus, playing an important role in acute phase response (APR) (Wang and Zhang, 2011). The immune responsive cells including lymphocyte-like cells and macrophage-like cells were found in the gill and intestine of amphioxus, respectively (Huang et al., 2011). Furthermore, the conserved molecules and signaling pathways involved in innate immune system were also identified in these organs in the amphioxus (Huang et al., 2011). Though the importance of these organs in digestive system and the value of these tissues for study of immune system evolution are demonstrated (Yuan et al., 2015), the molecular characters of these tissues are not revealed comprehensively.|$|R

40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} are uniquely capable of {{differentiating}} into somatic cell derivatives of all three germ lineages, therefore holding tremendous promise for developmental biology studies and regenerative medicine therapies. Although temporal patterns of phenotypic gene expression have been relatively well characterized {{during the course of}} differentiation, coincident patterns of endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factor expression that accompany pluripotent stem cell differentiation remain much less well-defined. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the global dynamic profiles of ECM and growth factor genes associated with early stages of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Gene expression analysis of ECM and growth factors by ESCs differentiating as embryoid bodies for up to 14 days was assessed using PCR arrays (172 unique genes total), and the results were examined using a variety of data mining methods. As expected, decreases in the expression of genes regulating pluripotent stem cell fate preceded subsequent increases in morphogen expression associated with differentiation. Pathway analysis generated solely from ECM and growth factor gene expression highlighted morphogenic cell processes within the embryoid bodies, such as cell growth, migration, and intercellular signaling, that are required for <b>primitive</b> tissue and <b>organ</b> developmental events.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two related}} topics: 1. The disanalogies between elective cosmetic practices and sex reassignment surgery. Why {{does it seem}} necessary for me – an aging professional woman – to ignore the blandishments of hairdressers wielding dyes and dermatologists wielding acids and scalpels? Why does it not seem equally necessary for a transgendered person to repudiate sex reassignment procedures? 2. The role {{of the body in}} identity and agency. How do phenomenological insights regarding the constitution of selfhood in relation to the interplay between the body image and corporeal know-how contribute to an account of the agency of transgendered individuals? Studying several paintings by contemporary feminist artist Jenny Saville has advanced my thinking on these topics. Saville’s imagery is an invaluable aid to reflection on these issues because she uses her painterly technique, which critics often dub “virtuoso,” to represent lived human bodies. In her work, viewers encounter representations of subjectivized, agentic corporeity, as distinct from inert, objectified flesh. Moreover, her sympathetic engagement with nonconformist, devalued bodies helps to reconfigure the standard gestalts of the human body that viewers typically carry with them and thus to convert fear and/or disgust into appreciation and understanding. In this paper, I consider three of Saville’s paintings. Plan, Saville’s self-portrait as a nude female whose body has been prepped for liposuction, conveys the pathos of this procedure. Matrix is a nude portrait of self-described “gender variant visual artist” Del LaGrace Volcano. In the words of one critic Saville’s depiction of Volcano’s nude intersexed body “restores beauty to the <b>primitive</b> [female] genital <b>organ.</b> ” Passage, another nude portrait of an intersexed individual, is an image of vibrant sexuality despite the presumptively jarring juxtaposition of breasts and a penis. I argue that conceiving the agentic subject as a rational deliberative capability that uses a conjoined body as the instrument of its will makes it impossible to theorize the agency of transgendered people. In contrast, when agentic subjects are understood as embodied subjects and embodiment is understood as a dimension of practical intelligence, the agency of transgendered individuals is intelligible...|$|R
40|$|Hematopoiesis is {{a tightly}} controlled, hierarchically {{organized}} developmental process whereby hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) {{give rise to}} highly specialized, differentiated blood cells. HSC are characterized by the capacity of both self-renewing and differentiating in downstream committed hematopoietic progenitor cells. In vertebrates, hematopoiesis in embryonic and fetal life occurs in <b>primitive</b> hematopoietic <b>organs</b> whereas in the adult organism the definitive site of blood cell production is the bone marrow (BM). HSC are quiescent cells that reside {{most of the time}} in G 0 -G 1 phases of the cell cycle, dividing during their lifespan {{as much as it is}} needed to maintain their own pool and give rise to committed precursors. Leukemia formation is characterized by the block of this process and accumulation of immature cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. In particular, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterized by the accumulation of large numbers of abnormal cells that fail to differentiate into functional mature blood cells. Leukemic blasts have a limited, exhaustible proliferative potential, suggesting that, in order to maintain leukemia growth, a small subpopulation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) must display an inexhaustible proliferative capacity and self-renewal potential. No definitive proof of LSCs was available, however, until Dick and colleagues showed that the engraftment of NOD/SCID mice with primary AML samples could only be accomplished using cells that were phenotypically similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by expressing CD 34 and lacking markers of lineage commitment such as CD 38. HSCs and LSCs share common features: self-renewal, the capacity to differentiate, resistance to apoptosis, and limitless proliferative potential. The pathway regulating these functional properties can be categorized into self-renewal, developmental, and miscellaneous pathways, each of which is governed by a distinct set of critical genes that have emerged from molecular profiling and can be associated with stemness. In particular Wingless (Wnt) /β catenin and PI 3 K/AKT pathways are crucial for the control of both HSCs and LSCs biology, because they regulate proliferation, self renewal and differentiation of HSCs and they are involved in maintenance of LSCs. Phosphorylation is one of the molecular mechanism responsible for the signal transduction modulation of these two pathways and some molecules belonging to these pathways are phosphorylated by serin-threonin kinase CK 2. Thus, this protein can have an important role in the biology of both HSCs and LSCs. CK 2 is a pleiotropic and constitutive activated kinase, which has a tetrameric structure composed by two alpha catalytic subunits and two beta regulatory subunits, but these two components can work also separately. CK 2 is essential for cell survival and proliferation, and is more and more evident its involvement in various aspects of tumor transformation. High levels of CK 2 are found in different tumor type such as breast, lung, kidney cancer and also blood cancer. CK 2 promotes the activity of proto-oncogenes (c-myc, C-Jun, A-Raf), drives cell cycle progression, stimulates beta-catenin activity, inhibits the onco-suppressors p 53, PML and PTEN, and it can exert an anti-apoptotic effect through the inhibition of caspase activity. For this reasons, the principal aim of our research project is obtaining experimental evidence of a role of CK 2 in normal hematopoiesis and in LSCs through the analysis of AML cell lines and samples collected from patients, and of a conditional knockout mouse model for CK 2 β in the hematopoietic system. As far as the role of CK 2 in the hematopoiesis is concerned, our conditional KO mouse model for CK 2 β in the hematopoietic compartment, demonstrate that the regulatory subunit of CK 2 has an important role in hematopoiesis. In particular, the KO of CK 2 β induces an impairment in hematopoiesis, especially in erythropoiesis. However, CK 2 β KO seems not to influence the HSCs pool but instead the hematopoietic progenitors. As far as the analysis of LSCs from AML samples, our analysis performed both on AML samples derive from patients and on Kasumi- 1 cell line demonstrated that CK 2 does not affect the Wnt/ β catenin and HH pathways, whereas it is able to modulate the PI 3 K/AKT pathway. Moreover, we have demonstrated that CK 2 is important in LSCs survival as its inhibition increases the apoptosis and potentiates the effects of Daunorubicin, a drug currently used for AML treatment in clinic. Taken together, all our results indicate that CK 2 possesses an important role both in hematopoiesis and in the biology of LSCs. ...|$|R
