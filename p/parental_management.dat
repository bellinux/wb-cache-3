40|$|The United States is a vehicle-dependent {{society and}} allows {{adolescents}} to obtain driver’s licenses at age 16 or younger. This {{study examined the}} impacts of a driver intervention program on reducing risky driving behaviors among youths who had received their first traffic citation, as well as <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> of driving practices. Participants consisted of 243 youths ages 16 and 17 who were court-ordered to attend the Ohio 4 -H CARTEENS (CAR = Caution and Responsibility and TEENS = Teens who volunteer as teachers) program with and without parents. Results indicated that risky driving behavior decreased significantly for both groups after the intervention program. <b>Parental</b> <b>management</b> practices, however, increased only for youths attending without parents. Regression analysis indicated that risky driving behavior at Time 1 and levels of <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> (parental control) at Time 2 predicted risky driving behavior after completion of the program.

40|$|Abstract Nighttime fears (NF) {{and sleep}} {{problems}} contin-ue to be major problems in clinical services. The {{aim was to}} assess the effects of two brief interventions on NF, and related sleep problems and parental fear-reducing behaviors in children. One hundred and four children aged 4 – 6 years with significant NF were randomly assigned into two intervention groups: the Huggy-Puppy intervention (HPI), which is based on providing children a puppy doll with a request {{to take care of the}} doll, and a revised version (HPI-r) which is based on providing the same doll with a cover story that the doll will serve as a protector. At baseline, the domains of NF, behavior problems, and sleep disruptions were assessed. Data were collected from parents and children using objective and subjective measures. The effects of the interventions were assessed by comparing four time points: baseline, first week of intervention, 1 month, and 6 months after initial intervention time. A waiting list comparison group (WL) was used as spontaneous recovery comparison group. Both interventions significantly reduced NF with similar impact. The improve-ment after 1 month was significantly higher than in the WL group. Furthermore, both interventions significantly reduced <b>parental</b> fear <b>management</b> behaviors and children’s sleep problems. Finally, the reduction in NF and <b>parental</b> fear <b>management</b> strategies were maintained 6 months post-treatment. Conclusions: Relatively simple and cost-effective doll interventions can reduce NF and their associated sleep problems. Further research is needed to implement these interventions for other anxiety disorders in childhood...|$|R

40|$|To {{find out}} about the medical and <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> of {{children}} having their first febrile convulsion a hospital-based questionnaire study was carried out in which parents were asked what they did at the time. Fifty-four out of 89 parents brought their child directly to hospital while the remainder attempted to contact their general practitioner, usually successfully, and were then referred to hospital. Whichever course of action the parents chose the outcome was satisfactory. Eighty-seven per cent of convulsions lasted for less than 15 minutes and in only two instances did they last longer than 30 minutes. One child who had convulsions for an hour was given intramuscular phenobarbitone at home without success, and the fit was finally terminated with intravenous diazepam. <b>Parental</b> <b>management</b> of the fit was often widly inappropriate.

This cross-sectional study examined parents' styles of prohibition {{to test the}} hypothesis that an autonomy-supportive style would relate negatively, whereas a controlling style would relate positively, to deviant peer affiliation. Such relations were expected because of the differential relations of styles of prohibition to adolescents' internalization of parental rules for friendships. Structural equation modeling provided support for the hypotheses in a sample of 234 Belgian midadolescents (M-age = 16. 45 years; 65 % female), as the differential relations of autonomy-supportive and controlling styles of prohibition to deviant peer affiliation were mediated by their differential relations to internalization.

40|$|The young driver {{problem is}} typified by high crash rates early in {{licensure}} that decline with experience, but are higher initially and decline more slowly for the youngest novices. Despite considerable effort, only Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS) {{policies have been}} shown to improve novice young driver safety outcomes. Unfortunately, GDLS policies are mostly limited to countries with a relatively young licensure age. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how GDLS and other young driver transportation safety efforts, including driver training and testing, supervised practice and <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> of young drivers, can best be configured. Notably, professional training can foster improvements in vehicle management skills that are necessary, but do not assure safe driving behavior. Substantial recent research has focused on training methods to improve driving skills, but the safety benefits of driver training have not been established. While prolonged practice driving increases experience and provides supervisors with opportunities to prepare novices for independent driving, the transition to independent driving challenges novices to employ, on their own, poorly-mastered skills under unfamiliar and complex driving conditions. Licensing policies and <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> practices can limit the complexity of driving conditions while novices gain needed driving experience. Nevertheless, an emerging body of literature suggests that future advances in training and supervision of novice teenage drivers might best focus on the translation of learning to independent driving by fostering safe driving attitudes and norms, judgment, dedicated attention to driving tasks and self-control at the wheel...|$|E

40|$|Sibling {{relationship}} {{quality is}} affected by several variables, such as gender, age spacing, marital conflicts, parenting, and parent-child relationship, which simultaneously influence personality and developmental outcomes. Furthermore, sibling relationships can significantly influence the social climate {{of the family and}} vice versa. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of household composition (1 -parent home vs. 2 -parent home) and the number of years between siblings ages on sibling relationship quality, and to determine whether <b>parental</b> conflict response <b>management</b> strategies differ between single-parent and 2 -parent homes. The participants were 124 adult mothers with at least 2 children. Participants provided demographic information and completed the Parental Expectations and Perceptions of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Sibling Relationships Questionnaire to measure sibling relationship quality and the <b>Parental</b> Conflict <b>Management</b> Strategies to measure parental responses to sibling conflict. The 4 research questions were assessed using a quantitative design that used 2 -factor multivariate analysis of variance and a chi-square test of independence. The result revealed that household type affected sibling rivalry such that 1 -parent households reported less sibling rivalry than 2 -parent households. The results also showed that there is no preference for any specific conflict management strategy for sibling conflict among single-parent and two-parent households. Social change implications may result from this study based on a better understanding of how sibling relationship quality has been affected by different family dynamics, such as changes in household composition...|$|R

40|$|Gottfredson and Hirschi's theory {{contained}} two propositions {{that have}} been the source of an emerging line of empirical scrutiny. First, according to the general theory of crime, levels of self-control are largely determined by <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> techniques and not by biogenic factors. Second, Gottfredson and Hirschi argued that low self-control should remain relatively stable over the life course. Data from twins drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to test these two hypotheses. The results of univariate model-fitting techniques revealed that genetic factors accounted for between 52 and 64  percent of the variance in low self-control, with the remaining variance attributable to the nonshared environment. Further, low self-control was stable over a two-year time period (r = . 64). Bivariate Cholesky decomposition models indicated that the stability of self-control was determined almost exclusively by genetic factors, and that genetic factors also explained a moderate amount of change in self-control. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Although parents’ {{involvement}} {{has been}} identified as important for interventions for their children and young people, little research is conducted to explore <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> strategies for anxiety in children and young people with mild to moderate learning disabilities (LD) and autism. Given that children and young people with LD and autism are more vulnerable to experience anxiety, the overall purpose of this thesis was to identify the prevalence rates of anxiety and explore management strategies for anxiety in children and young people with LD and autism. Three studies were conducted to identify prevalence of anxiety and develop and implement a parental programme of management strategies for anxiety in children and young people with LD and autism. In the first study of this research “Screening study”, 150 children and young people with LD and autism were screened for anxiety using Reiss Scale and Glasgow Anxiety Scale. Results from the screening indicated that children and young people with LD and autism have high prevalence rates of anxiety (32. 6 %). The second study of this research “Developing a programme” was to develop a programme of management strategies for anxiety from parents’, carer’s, teachers’ and health professionals’ views. In this study parents and teachers were interviewed regarding the management strategies they use to manage their children’s / young people’s anxiety. Results from 34 interviews revealed that sixteen different management strategies were identified by parents and teachers of children and young people with LD and autism. Following this, the management strategies identified by parents, carers and teachers were discussed with an expert panel of health professionals to develop a parental programme “Calm Child Programme” of the most useful and appropriate strategies for those children and young people. The Calm Child Programme was developed using Delphi method to identify a consensus approach with professionals. This consisted of ten useful management strategies for parents to manage their children’s and young people’s anxiety. Finally, the third study of this research “Implementing the calm child programme” was a pilot study of the implementation for the Calm Child Programme. This programme of <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> strategies for anxiety was piloted with seven parents of children and young people with LD and autism. The results from the pilot study indicate reduction in the children’s and young people’s anxiety after its use by parents. Parents reported that the developed strategies were useful in managing their children’s and young people’s anxiety. This research has two key contributions to knowledge. Firstly, this research highlighted the theme of anxiety of children and young people with LD and autism. The identification of high prevalence of anxiety in this population indicates the need for management strategies. Secondly, this research aimed to improve the paucity of autism specific research as it relates to anxiety management strategies in children and young people with autism. This research explored a new programme of <b>parental</b> <b>management</b> strategies for anxiety in children and young people with LD and autism.

Three important findings emerged. First, consistent with previous research, prohibiting was positively related to adolescents' affiliations with deviant friends, whereas support was positively related to a sense of group belongingness. Guiding was negatively related to group belongingness. Second, the direct effect of prohibiting on adolescents' affiliations with deviant friends was substantially accounted for by perceived parental psychological control. Third, the effect of guiding was moderated by perceived psychological control, so that it negatively predicted a sense of group belongingness only under conditions of high psychological control. The findings indicate that <b>parental</b> peer <b>management</b> strategies are associated with lower deviant and more positive peer affiliations, if they are not perceived as intruding upon adolescents' private world.
