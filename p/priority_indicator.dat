3000|$|... 2. Priority-aware {{transmission}} coordination mechanism: Since {{the transmission}} scheduling of each class of sensors is designed by fully utilizing the resource {{blocks in the}} superframe, a priority-aware transmission coordination mechanism is required to resolve the collisions among the sensors with different priorities. As shown in Fig. 1, we introduce a <b>priority</b> <b>indicator</b> by setting C− 1 sub-slots {{at the beginning of}} each time slot. The time length of a sub-slot can be set to the backoff period defined in IEEE 802.15. 4 protocol. For the priority class c= 1, its sensors have the highest transmission priority. Hence, if one sensor of class 1 has data packet to transmit, it first transmits the carrier signal during the C− 1 sub-slots as the <b>priority</b> <b>indicator</b> and then transmit the data packet during the remaining part of the slot. For any priority class c> 1, its sensors have to transmit data packet opportunistically. If one sensor from priority class c has data packet to transmit, it has to sense the channel for only one sub-slot, i.e., the sub-slot c− 1. If the channel is sensed idle during this sub-slot, it transmits the carrier signal during the remaining sub-slots c,…,C− 1 and then transmits the data packet; otherwise, it postpones the channel access try to the next scheduled slot. Note that more complicated preamble signal can be used instead of the carrier signal, thus to embed the SDP into some existing communication protocols.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS Despite {{advances}} in {{our knowledge of}} effective services for people who use drugs over the last decades globally, coverage remains poor in most countries, while quality is often unknown. This paper aims to discuss {{the historical development of}} successful epidemiological indicators and to present a framework for extending them with additional indicators of coverage and quality of harm reduction services, for monitoring and evaluation at international, national or subnational levels. The ultimate aim is to improve these services in order to reduce health and social problems among people who use drugs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, crime and legal problems, overdose (death) and other morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS The framework was developed collaboratively using consensus methods involving nominal group meetings, review of existing quality standards, repeated email commenting rounds and qualitative analysis of opinions/experiences from a broad range of professionals/experts, including members of civil society and organisations representing people who use drugs. Twelve <b>priority</b> candidate <b>indicators</b> are proposed for opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and generic cross-cutting aspects of harm reduction (and potentially other drug) services. Under the specific OAT <b>indicators,</b> <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> included 'coverage', 'waiting list time', 'dosage' and 'availability in prisons'. For the specific NSP <b>indicators,</b> the <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> included 'coverage', 'number of needles/syringes distributed/collected', 'provision of other drug use paraphernalia' and 'availability in prisons'. Among the generic or cross-cutting <b>indicators</b> the <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> were 'infectious diseases counselling and care', 'take away naloxone', 'information on safe use/sex' and 'condoms'. We discuss conditions for the successful development of the suggested indicators and constraints (e. g. funding, ideology). We propose conducting a pilot study to test the feasibility and applicability of the proposed indicators before their scaling up and routine implementation, to evaluate their effectiveness in comparing service coverage and quality across countries. CONCLUSIONS The establishment of an improved set of validated and internationally agreed upon best practice indicators for monitoring harm reduction service will provide a structural basis for public health and epidemiological studies and support evidence and human rights-based health policies, services and interventions...|$|R

40|$|This project prioritised {{thirteen}} biological {{indicators of}} soil quality which showed high current potential for deployment in a national-scale soil monitoring scheme. These indicators met {{a range of}} scientific and technical criteria that related soil functions and feasibility within large-scale surveys. The priority indicators with associated methodologies are: - Eight soil microbial groups [ammonia oxidisers, denitrifiers, fungi, bacteria, Archaea, methanogens, methanotrophs and actinomycetes] identified from TRFLP fingerprinting - Soil microbial community structure and biomass characterised from PLFA profiles - Multiple substrate induced respiration (MSIR) derived by GC or MicrorespTM - Multi-enzyme profiling via microplate fluorometric assay - Nematode community structure from Baermann extractions - Microarthropod community structure from Tullgren dry extractions The selection process was robust, repeatable and auditable. A structured framework denoted a 'logical sieve' was developed to support the incorporation and analysis {{of a large number}} of assessments against a wide range of technical and scientific criteria relevant to national scale soil monitoring. This enabled a consistent synthesis of available information and the semi-objective assessment of 183 potential biological indicators identified from the literature. Stakeholder priorities for technical criteria were identified through consultation, with the UK-SIC and the expert reviewers, and incorporated into the final prioritisation phase of the logical sieve. The power of this approach is that it provides a clear audit trail on the decision-making process and would allow the inclusion of further indicators into the framework. The process was initially reviewed by experts familiar with biological indicators and soil monitoring and then assessed at a two-day expert workshop. Comments and discussions on the relative importance and robustness of potential indicators and future research priorities proved invaluable to the final selection. As a consequence, the logical sieve was modified to prioritise biological indicators for all three soil functions rather than simply biological indicators with the highest universal scores. The final priority indicators were selected by reviewing the outputs from the logical sieve. Each <b>priority</b> <b>indicator,</b> with associated method, was assessed for relevance to ecological services, obvious surrogacy, the range of indicator indices produced and practicalities of use. Each <b>priority</b> <b>indicator</b> was reviewed and outstanding issues relating to deployment identified.

40|$|Changes {{to source}} code {{have become a}} {{critical}} factor in fault predictions. Text or syntactic approaches have been widely used. Textual analysis focuses on changed text fragments while syntactic analysis focuses on changed syntactic entities. Although both of them have demonstrated their advantages in experimental results, they only study code fragments modified during changes. Because of semantic dependencies within programs, we believe that code fragments impacted by changes are also helpful. Given a source code change, we identify its impact by program slicing along the variable def-use chains. To evaluate the effectiveness of change impacts in fault detection and prediction, we compare impacted code with changed code according to size and fault density. Our experiment on the change history of a successful industrial project shows that: fault density in changed and impacted fragments are higher than other areas; for large changes, their impacts have higher fault density than changes themselves; interferences within change impact contribute to the high fault density in large changes. Our study suggests that, like change itself, change impact is also a high <b>priority</b> <b>indicator</b> in fault prediction, especially for changes of large scales. 1...|$|E

However, few studies have evaluated leadership interventions to enhance nurses’ use of guideline recommendations {{in the field of}} knowledge translation. Purpose: To develop and evaluate an intervention designed to operationalize a leadership strategy composed of relations, change, and task-orientated leadership behaviours, and to examine its influence on nurses’ use of guideline recommendations in home-care nursing. Design: Sequential mixed methods pilot study with post-only cluster randomized controlled trial. Methods Phase I: Intervention Development 1. 	A participatory approach was used at a community healthcare organization with 23 units across the province of Ontario, Canada. The guideline selected was developed by the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario for the assessment and management of foot ulcers for people with diabetes. 2. 	Integrative literature review, qualitative interviews, and baseline chart audits were conducted. 3. 	Four units were randomized to control or experimental groups. 4. 	Clinical and management leadership teams participated in a 12 -week intervention consisting of printed materials, interactive workshop, and teleconferences. Participants received summarized chart audit data, identified <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> for change, and created a team leadership action plan to address barriers and influence guideline use. Phase II: Evaluation 5. 	Chart audits compared differences in nursing process and patient outcomes. Primary outcome: eight-item nursing assessment score. 6. 	Qualitative interviews evaluated the intervention and leadership behaviours. Results: No significant difference was found in the primary outcome. A significant difference was observed in nurses’ documentation of five <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> chosen by the experimental groups (p=. 02). Gaps in care included: 53 %, 76 %, and 94 % of patients not assessed for ulcer depth, foot circulation, or neuropathy (respectively); 75 % and 93 % did not receive wound debridement or hydrogel dressings. Receiving data to identify <b>priority</b> <b>indicators</b> for change and developing a leadership action plan were reported as useful to guideline implementation. The experimental group described using more relations-oriented leadership behaviours conducting audit and feedback, and sending reminders.
