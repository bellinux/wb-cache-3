5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and chemical barrier in manufacturing integrated circuits, to electrically isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between <b>polysilicon</b> layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
25|$|An {{individual}} {{memory cell}} {{is made up}} of one planar <b>polysilicon</b> layer containing a hole filled by multiple concentric vertical cylinders. The hole's <b>polysilicon</b> surface acts as the gate electrode. The outermost silicon dioxide cylinder acts as the gate dielectric, enclosing a silicon nitride cylinder that stores charge, in turn enclosing a silicon dioxide cylinder as the tunnel dielectric that surrounds a central rod of conducting <b>polysilicon</b> which acts as the conducting channel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polysilicon</b> {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped <b>polysilicon</b> is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the <b>polysilicon.</b> Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than <b>polysilicon</b> alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with <b>polysilicon</b> alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} gate may be conductive (typically <b>polysilicon</b> in most kinds of flash memory) or non-conductive (as in SONOS flash memory).|$|E
25|$|Growth of a {{group of}} V-NAND cells begins with an {{alternating}} stack of conducting (doped) <b>polysilicon</b> layers and insulating silicon dioxide layers.|$|E
25|$|Major {{corporations}} with {{headquarters in}} Tennessee include FedEx, AutoZone and International Paper, all based in Memphis; Pilot Corporation and Regal Entertainment Group, based in Knoxville; Eastman Chemical Company, based in Kingsport; the North American headquarters of Nissan Motor Company, based in Franklin; Hospital Corporation of America and Caterpillar Financial, based in Nashville; and Unum, based in Chattanooga. Tennessee {{is also the}} location of the Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, a $2 billion <b>polysilicon</b> production facility by Wacker Chemie in Bradley County, and a $1.2 billion <b>polysilicon</b> production facility by Hemlock Semiconductor in Clarksville.|$|E
25|$|When the {{transistors}} {{are extremely}} scaled down, {{it is necessary}} to make the gate dielectric layer very thin, around 1nm in state-of-the-art technologies. A phenomenon observed here is the so-called poly depletion, where a depletion layer is formed in the gate <b>polysilicon</b> layer next to the gate dielectric when the transistor is in the inversion. To avoid this problem, a metal gate is desired. A variety of metal gates such as tantalum, tungsten, tantalum nitride, and titanium nitride are used, usually in conjunction with high-κ dielectrics. An alternative is to use fully silicided <b>polysilicon</b> gates, a process known as FUSI.|$|E
25|$|SMP Ltd. is a {{joint venture}} between Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC. MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. and an {{affiliate}} of Korean conglomerate Samsung are forming a joint venture to build a <b>polysilicon</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the increase in}} power consumption due to gate current leakage, a high-κ dielectric is used instead of silicon dioxide for the gate insulator, while <b>polysilicon</b> is replaced by metal gates (see Intel announcement).|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, <b>polysilicon</b> ("poly") cells became {{increasingly}} popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon ("mono") counterparts, {{but they are}} grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.|$|E
25|$|Polycrystalline silicon, or {{multicrystalline}} silicon (multi-Si) {{cells are}} made from cast square ingots—large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. They consist of small crystals giving the material its typical metal flake effect. <b>Polysilicon</b> cells {{are the most common}} type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive, but also less efficient, than those made from monocrystalline silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is to form a {{cylindrical}} hole through these layers. In practice, a 128Gibit V-NAND chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 2.9 billion such holes. Next the hole's inner surface receives multiple coatings, first silicon dioxide, then silicon nitride, then a second layer of silicon dioxide. Finally, the hole is filled with conducting (doped) <b>polysilicon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{threshold}} voltage (and consequently the drain to source on-current) is modified {{by the work}} function difference between the gate material and channel material. Because <b>polysilicon</b> is a semiconductor, its work function can be modulated by adjusting the type and level of doping. Furthermore, because <b>polysilicon</b> has the same bandgap as the underlying silicon channel, it is quite straightforward to tune the work function to achieve low {{threshold voltage}}s for both NMOS and PMOS devices. By contrast, the work functions of metals are not easily modulated, so tuning the work function to obtain low threshold voltages becomes a significant challenge. Additionally, obtaining low-threshold devices on both PMOS and NMOS devices sometimes {{requires the use of}} different metals for each device type. While bimetallic integrated circuits (i.e., one type of metal for gate electrodes of NFETS and a second type of metal for gate electrodes of PFETS) are not common, they are known in patent literature and provide some benefit in terms of tuning electrical circuits' overall electrical performance.|$|E
25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three <b>polysilicon</b> panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells can}} be {{classified}} into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or wafer-based cells—are made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as <b>polysilicon</b> and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, <b>polysilicon</b> is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
25|$|The silanes {{comprise}} a homologous series of silicon hydrides {{with the general}} formula SinH2n+2. They are all strong reducing agents. Unbranched and branched trains are known up to n = 8, and the cycles Si5H10 and Si6H12 are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed). They decompose to form polymeric <b>polysilicon</b> hydride and hydrogen gas. As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more volatile than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates nucleophilic attack at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, {{and the ability of}} silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's activation energy.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>polysilicon</b> gates {{have been}} the de facto {{standard}} for the last twenty years, they do have some disadvantages which have led to their likely future replacement by metal gates. These disadvantages include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "metal" [...] in {{the name}} MOSFET is now often a misnomer because the gate {{material}} is [...] often a layer of <b>polysilicon</b> (polycrystalline silicon). [...] "Oxide" [...] {{in the name}} {{can also be a}} misnomer, as different dielectric materials are used with the aim of obtaining strong channels with smaller applied voltages.|$|E
2500|$|The gate {{dielectric}} insulator in a MISFET is silicon dioxide in a MOSFET, but other materials {{can also be}} employed. [...] The {{gate dielectric}} lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MISFET. [...] The term [...] "metal" [...] is historically used for the gate material, even though now it is usually highly doped <b>polysilicon</b> or some other nonmetal.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Samsung showcased the world's {{thinnest}} OLED display, {{also the}} first to be [...] "flappable" [...] and bendable. It measures just 0.05mm (thinner than paper), yet a Samsung staff member said that it is [...] "technically possible to make the panel thinner". To achieve this thickness, Samsung etched an OLED panel that uses a normal glass substrate. The drive circuit was formed by low-temperature <b>polysilicon</b> TFTs. Also, low-molecular organic EL materials were employed. The pixel count of the display is 480 × 272. The contrast ratio is 100,000:1, and the luminance is 200cd/m2. The colour reproduction range is 100% of the NTSC standard.|$|E

2500|$|Heating of the EUV mask {{pellicle}} (film temperature up to 750 K for 80 W incident power) is {{a significant}} concern, due to the resulting deformation and transmission decrease. ASML developed a 70nm thick <b>polysilicon</b> pellicle membrane, which allows EUV transmission of 82%; however, {{less than half of}} the membranes survived expected EUV power levels. SiNx pellicle membranes also failed at 82 W equivalent EUV source power levels. [...] Alternative [...] materials need to allow sufficient transmission as well as maintain mechanical and thermal stability. However, graphite, graphene or other carbon nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes) are damaged by EUV due to the release of electrons and also too easily etched in the hydrogen cleaning plasma expected to be deployed in EUV scanners. [...] Hydrogen plasmas can also etch silicon as well. A coating helps improve hydrogen resistance, but this reduces transmission and/or emissivity, and may also affect mechanical stability (e.g., bulging). The current lack of any suitable pellicle material, aggravated by the use of hydrogen plasma cleaning in the EUV scanner, presents an obstacle to volume production.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Pinto, {{a former}} {{scientist}} at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena, published in Physical Review his Gedankenexperiment for a [...] "Casimir engine". The paper showed that continuous positive net exchange of {{energy from the}} Casimir effect was possible, even stating in the abstract [...] "In the event of no other alternative explanations, one should conclude that major technological advances {{in the area of}} endless, by-product free-energy production could be achieved." [...] In 2001 Capasso et al. showed how the force can be used to control the mechanical motion of a MEMS device, The researchers suspended a <b>polysilicon</b> plate from a torsional rod – a twisting horizontal bar just a few microns in diameter. When they brought a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as hysteresis and bistability in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system’s behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>polysilicon</b> dihalides are {{generally}} stable under vacuum {{up to about}} 150-200°C, after which they decompose to perhalosilanes, SinX2n+2 (where n = 1 to 14), and to <b>polysilicon</b> monohalides. However, they are air and moisture sensitive. <b>Polysilicon</b> difluoride is more reactive than the heavier <b>polysilicon</b> dihalides. In stark contrast to its carbon analog, polytetrafluoroethylene, (SiF2)n ignites spontaneously in air, whereas (SiCl2)n inflames in dry air only when heated to 150°C. The halogen atoms in <b>polysilicon</b> dihalides can be substituted with organic groups. For example, (SiCl2)n undergoes substitution by alcohols to give poly(dialkoxysilylene)s.The <b>polysilicon</b> monohalides are all stable to 400°C, but are also water and air sensitive. <b>Polysilicon</b> monofluoride reacts more vigorously than the heavier <b>polysilicon</b> monohalides. For example, (SiF)n decomposes SiF4 above 400°C explosively.|$|E
50|$|Polycide is a {{silicide}} formed over <b>polysilicon.</b> Widely used in DRAMs. In a polycide MOSFET transistor process, the silicide {{is formed}} only over the <b>polysilicon</b> film as formation occurs prior to any <b>polysilicon</b> etch. Polycide processes contrast with salicide processes in which silicide is formed after the <b>polysilicon</b> etch. Thus, with a salicide process, silicide is formed over both the <b>polysilicon</b> gate and the exposed monocrystalline terminal {{regions of the}} transistor in a self-aligned fashion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polysilicon</b> {{consists}} of small crystals, {{also known as}} crystallites, giving the material its typical metal flake effect. While <b>polysilicon</b> and multisilicon are often used as synonyms, multicrystalline usually refers to crystals larger than 1 mm. Multicrystalline solar cells {{are the most common}} type of solar cells in the fast-growing PV market and consume most of the worldwide produced <b>polysilicon.</b> About 5 tons of <b>polysilicon</b> is required to manufacture 1 megawatt (MW) of conventional solar modules. <b>Polysilicon</b> is distinct from monocrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polysilicon</b> {{has many}} {{applications}} in VLSI manufacturing. One of its primary uses is as gate electrode material for MOS devices. A <b>polysilicon</b> gate's electrical conductivity {{may be increased}} by depositing a metal (such as tungsten) or a metal silicide (such as tungsten silicide) over the gate. <b>Polysilicon</b> may also be employed as a resistor, a conductor, or as an ohmic contact for shallow junctions, with the desired electrical conductivity attained by doping the <b>polysilicon</b> material.|$|E
50|$|Prices of <b>polysilicon</b> {{are often}} {{divided into two}} categories, {{contract}} and spot prices, and higher purity commands higher prices. While in booming installation times, price rally occurs in <b>polysilicon.</b> Not only spot prices surpass contract prices in the market; {{but it is also}} hard to acquire enough <b>polysilicon.</b> Buyers will accept down payment and long term agreements to acquire a large enough volume of <b>polysilicon.</b> On the contrary, spot prices will be below contract prices once the solar PV installation is in a down trend. In late 2010, booming installation brought up the spot prices of <b>polysilicon.</b> In the first half of 2011, prices of <b>polysilicon</b> kept strong owing to the FIT policies of Italy. The solar PV price survey and market research firm, PVinsights, reported that the prices of <b>polysilicon</b> might be dragged down by lack of installation {{in the second half of}} 2011. As recently as 2008 prices were over $400/kg spiking from levels around $200/kg, while seen falling to $15/kg in 2013.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polysilicon</b> {{hydrides}} are polymers containing only silicon and hydrogen. They {{have the}} formula (SiHn)x where 0.2 &le; n &le; 2.5 and x {{is the number}} of monomer units. The <b>polysilicon</b> hydrides are generally colorless or pale-yellow/ocher powders that are easily hydrolyzed and ignite readily in air.

50|$|The <b>polysilicon</b> halides can be {{considered}} structural derivatives of the <b>polysilicon</b> hydrides, in which the side-group hydrogen atoms are substituted with halogen atoms. In the monomeric silicon dihalide (aka dihalosilylene and dihalosilene) molecule, which is analogous to carbene molecules, the silicon atom is divalent (forms two bonds). By contrast, in both the <b>polysilicon</b> dihalides and the <b>polysilicon</b> monohalides, {{as well as the}} <b>polysilicon</b> hydrides, the silicon atom is tetravalent with a local coordination geometry that is tetrahedral, even though the stoichiometry of the monohalides (SiXn = SinXn) might erroneously imply a structural analogy between perhalopolysilynes and linear polyacetylenes with the similar formula (C2H2)n. The carbon atoms in the polyacetylene polymer are sp2-hybridized and thus have a local coordination geometry that is trigonal planar. However, this is not observed in the <b>polysilicon</b> halides or hydrides because the Si=Si double bond in disilene compounds are much more reactive than C=C double bonds. Only when the substituent groups on silicon are very large are disilene compounds kinetically non-labile.|$|E
