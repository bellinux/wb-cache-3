5000|$|They can be {{the result}} of <b>phonotrauma.</b> <b>Phonotrauma</b> refers to {{behaviours}} that can lead to vocal fold injuries, such as vocal overuse (i.e. too much speaking), vocal misuse (i.e. speaking in an unnaturally high or low pitch), or vocal abuse (i.e. yelling or whispering for prolonged periods). Vocal folds vibrate during phonation resulting in repeated collisions of the right and left vocal folds. <b>Phonotrauma</b> subjects the vocal folds to excessive mechanical forces during these vibratory cycles, which can lead {{to the development of a}} wound. It is the healing of these wounds, which leads to tissue re-structuring, that can result in a vocal fold cyst.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of vocal fold lesions primarily {{arise in the}} cover of the folds. Since the basal lamina secures the epithelium to the superficial layer of the lamina propria with anchoring fibers, this is a common site for injury. If a person has a <b>phonotrauma</b> or habitual vocal hyperfunction, also known as pressed phonation, the proteins in the basal lamina can shear, causing vocal fold injury, usually seen as nodules or polyps, which increase the mass and thickness of the cover. The squamous cell epithelium of the anterior glottis are also a frequent site of laryngeal cancer caused by smoking.|$|E
40|$|Personalized, pre-emptive and {{predictive}} medicine is the capstone of contemporary medical care. The central {{aim of this}} dissertation is to address clinical challenges in prescribing personalized therapy to patients with acute <b>phonotrauma.</b> Inflammation and healing, which are innate tissue responses to mechanical stress/ trauma, are regulated by a complex dynamic system. A systems biology approach, which combines empirical, mathematical and computational tools, was taken to study the biological complexity of this dynamic system in vocal fold injury. Computational agent-based models (ABMs) were developed to quantitatively characterize multiple cellular and molecular interactions around inflammation and healing. The models allowed for tests of various hypothetical effects of motion-based treatments in individuals with acute <b>phonotrauma.</b> A <b>phonotrauma</b> ABM was calibrated and verified with empirical data of a panel of inflammatory mediators, obtained from laryngeal secretions in individuals following experimentally induced <b>phonotrauma</b> and a randomly assigned motion-based treatment. A supplementary ABM of surgically induced vocal fold trauma was developed and subsequently calibrated and verified with empirical data of inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix substances from rat studies, {{for the purpose of}} gaining insight into the &ldquo net effect &rdquo of cellular and molecular responses at the tissue level. ABM simulations reproduced and predicted trajectories of inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix as seen in empirical data of <b>phonotrauma</b> and surgical vocal fold trauma. The simulation results illustrated a spectrum of inflammatory responses to <b>phonotrauma,</b> surgical trauma and motion-based treatments. The results suggested that resonant voice exercise may optimize the combination of para- and anti-inflammatory responses to accelerate healing. Moreover, the ABMs suggested that hyaluronan fragments might be an early molecular index of tissue damage that is sensitive to varying stress levels - from relatively low phonatory stress to high surgical stress. We propose that this translational application of biosimulation can be used to quantitatively chart individual healing trajectories, test the effects of different treatment options and most importantly provide new understanding of laryngeal health and healing. By placing biology on a firm mathematical foundation, this line of research has potential to influence the contour of scientific thinking and clinical care of vocal fold injury...|$|E
40|$|The {{collision}} {{between the}} vocal folds during phonation is a physiological phenomenon {{with a powerful}} role in the synchronization of their vibration. This collision is also {{a component of the}} <b>phonotrauma.</b> The role of <b>phonotrauma</b> in the pathophysiology of dysphonia is commonly accepted but its nature still unclear and its quantification remains difficult. This work proposes, an in vivo study in healthy subjects, and ex vivo ones on excised human larynges. The purpose of this work was to study the laryngeal behavior when the larynx is subjected to extremely high subglottic pressure. In vivo, the shouted voice was recorded with constant measure of subglottic pressure. Ex vivo, the subglottic pressure was directly manipulated independently from other parameters. The ex vivo study required a methodological development to modernize the experimental bench used for animal larynges studies and to adapt it to the human larynx. The results showed, in healthy speakers the existence of a "plateau" in the vocal intensity and in the electroglottographic signal for very high levels of subglottic pressure. The studies on excised larynges measured the collision force between the vocal folds and its changes depending on subglottic pressure. They also highlighted the existence of a "plateau" in the collision force when subglottic pressure was very high. The observations presented in this work are, to our knowledge, unprecedented. They have important clinical interest for understanding the concept of <b>phonotrauma.</b> Their interpretation in physical terms remains very incomplete...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{role of the}} speech-language {{pathology}} in the multiprofessional team {{dealing with}} laryngology and the voice has been recognized for a long time. Scientific studies in this field recommend therapies for laryngeal microsurgeries; few of the studies, however, effectively evaluate the result of postoperative speech therapy. Objective To compare speech therapy evaluation and treatment among patients with phonotraumatic lesions and patients with lesions unrelated to <b>phonotrauma</b> who underwent laryngeal microsurgery. Methods This study was performed at IPO Hospital (Paranaense Institute of Otorhinolaryngology, Curitiba, Paran&# 225;, Brazil) between February 2010 and February 2011. Of 254 patients who underwent laryngeal microsurgery, 208 patients {{were included in the}} study and divided in two groups: group A with phonotraumatic lesions (n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 131) and group B with lesions unrelated to <b>phonotrauma</b> (n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 77). The number of sessions and the functional result after speech therapy were evaluated. Results The number of postoperative phonotherapy sessions after microsurgery was up to 10 sessions in 89. 31 % and 87. 71 % for groups A and B, respectively. Phonotherapy treatment showed a better functional evolution in group A (92. 37 %). Conclusion A significant difference was observed only in functional evolution, which was better in the group with phonotraumatic lesions (p&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 0001) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of vocal <b>phonotrauma</b> is underestimated {{in the teaching}} population. Teachers are susceptible to vocal problems because of occupational, environmental, and physical factors. A descriptive research design examined whether teachers were aware of vocal problems, prevention, and remediation. A needs assessment indicated that a vocal hygiene instructional videotape would be useful. Instrumental assessments administered to teachers included pre- and post-questionnaires and the Voice Handicap Index. Speech pathologists served as expert raters {{to determine if the}} videotape had value as a preventative tool. An instructional videotape was created to assess teachers ’ awareness and identification of vocal problems, occupational voice concerns, and vocal remediation. A non-parametric analysis using Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed-ranks demonstrated a significant difference between pre- and post- scores. The results indicated that an instructional videotape increased teachers ’ awareness about voice misuse/overuse and treatment options. This videotape could be used for training, therapy and promote a healthier work environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective: Subglottal {{pressure}} is often {{considered as a}} clue of vocal abuse, and this parameter is supposed to beat {{the origin of the}} phonotraumatism. This study is based on experiments on excised human larynges. Theobjective {{of this study was to}} analyze the contact pressure between the vocal folds during phonation and itsrelation with subglottal pressure until very high values. Material and methods: 7 human excised larynges were set on the experimental test-bench. The vocal foldadduction was determined before the tests, using concomitant arytenoid adduction and membranous vocal foldmedialization with Montgomery implants. The subglottal pressure (SGP) increased from 0 to 200 hPa. Thecontact pressure was measured with a pressure sensor placed between the vocal folds, the tracheal airflow andsubglottal pressure were measured 1 cm under the glottis, the electroglottography (EGG) was recorded, as wellas the audio signal (microphone distance: 15 cm from the larynx). Results: At the phonation threshold, contact pressure appeared at the same time as the first activity of EGG,before the onset of the glottal cycle, then rapidly increased until a plateau. The maximal values of the contactpressure were very variable between the larynges (range: 0, 7 - 12 kPa). This contact pressure was not proportionalto the subglottal pressure. Discussion: These results question the role of subglottal pressure as the main factor of <b>phonotrauma</b> in vocalabuse when glottal configuration is constant. The adduction forces between vocal folds may be more relevant butvery difficult to measure in patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Parameters to {{distinguish}} normal from deviant voices {{in early childhood}} have not been established. The current study sought to auditorily and acoustically characterize voices of children, and to study the relationship between vocal behavior reported by teachers {{and the presence of}} vocal aberrations. Methods: One hundred children between four and 6 years and 11 months, who attended early childhood educational institutions, were included. The sample comprised 50 children with normal voices (NVG) and 50 with deviant voices (DVG) matched by gender and age. All participants were submitted to auditory and acoustic analysis of vocal quality and had their vocal behaviors assessed by teachers through a specific protocol. Results: DVG had a higher incidence of breathiness (p < 0. 001) and roughness (p < 0. 001), but not vocal strain (p = 0. 546), which was similar in both groups. The average F- 0 was lower in the DVG and a higher noise component was observed in this group as well. Regarding the protocol used "Aspects Related to <b>Phonotrauma</b> - Children's Protocol", higher means were observed for children from DVG in all analyzed aspects and also on the overall means (DVG = 2. 15; NVG = 1. 12, p < 0. 001). In NVG, a higher incidence of vocal behavior without alterations or with discrete alterations was observed, whereas a higher incidence of moderate, severe or extreme alterations of vocal behavior was observed in DVG. Conclusions: Perceptual assessment of voice, vocal acoustic parameters (F- 0, noise and GNE), and aspects related to vocal trauma and vocal behavior differentiated the groups of children with normal voice and deviant voice.

40|$|Theme: Care of the Professional VoiceAbstract no. M 17 <b>Phonotrauma</b> {{is one of}} {{the common}} causes leading to voice {{disorders}} and contributes to the formation of benign vocal fold lesions. There is sufficient evidence which showed contemporary treatment (e. g. anti-inflammatory medications and surgery) and voice rest are effective in the management of phonotraumatic lesions. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has also been used as a therapeutic measure in treating dysphonia. A number of herbal medicine decoctions or formulae have been reported to be effective in treating dysphonia. Fluid nourishment decoction is a popular ancestral formula used to treat chronic pharyngeal and laryngeal inflammatory diseases. It consists of eight individual herbs, Rehmannia glutinosa (Shou di huang), Ophiopogon japonicus (Mai men dong), Scrophularia ningpoensis (Xuan shen), Paeonia suffruticosa (Mu dan pi), Fritillariae Cirrhosae (Bei Mu), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (fresh) (Gan cao), Mentha haplocalyx (Bo he) and Paeonia lactiflora (Bai Shao). There is however relatively little specific information on how the decoction brings about the improvement. Indeed, there exists virtually no study that employed a randomized control design with objective outcome measures to investigate efficacy of this decoction in treating phonotraumatic lesions. This study employed a randomized-control style to investigate the effectiveness of the fluid nourishment decoction in treating dysphonia with phonotraumatic lesions. Those eligible subjects were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: (a) experimental group (herbal medicine); and (b) placebo group. The outcome measures used included (a) voice range profile (phonetogram), (b) voice activity and participation profile (VAPP, Ma & Yiu, 2001) (c) sentence recording for perceptual voice evaluation, (d) stroboscopy, and (e) voice symptom scale (VoiSS). Preliminary results showed that the group that received the herbal medicine decoction improved better in their vocal function than the placebo group of subjects...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of deterministic and stochastic modeling techniques to problemsin immunology. First, we employ {{the example of a}} host response to influenza virusinfection to illustrate differences in the dynamical behavior of the deterministic and thestochastic models, and employ both versions in the analysis of the role of immune responsein controlling and suppressing the infection. Second, we develop a dynamical model of vocalfold inflammation and use random sampling techniques to calibrate the model againstavailable data. In the stochastic model, we analyze three solution techniques - Gillespie's stochastic simulationalgorithm, numerical solution of mean extinction time through the Laplace transformof the master equation, and approximate solution of a limiting case. Gillespie algorithm iscapable of dealing with large systems as the required memory depends linearly on number ofspecies, but is limited by computational time. Laplace's method is efficient and accurate butis limited by system size. We construct a novel combination of the two that takes advantageof both. We also derive an approximate Markov chain of the system and analytically computethe extinction times and probabilities in the limiting case when an infected cell generateslarge number of viruses. In the analysis of the human immune response, we find that innateresponse substantially reduces cell extinction probability, cellular response increases the virusextinction probability in limiting case, and adaptive response, combined with the other two,almost eliminates cell extinction and significantly increases virus extinction probability. In the model of vocal fold inflammation, a four-variable ordinary differential equation (ODE) model is presented. The ODE model characterizes cytokine interactions in phonotraumaand is calibrated with empirical data. Parameter values are estimated and theirprobability densities are sampled using Metropolis and parallel tempering algorithms. Sensitivityanalysis showed that 6 of 17 parameters suffice to retain the sensitivity of the modeltrajectories. The reduced parameter set is applied to individual data to be calibrated andpredict the individual outcome. The model is a part of larger study intended to find optimaltreatment strategy for <b>phonotrauma</b> through a personalized vocal exercise or rest program...|$|E
40|$|The human {{vocal folds}} {{experience}} mechanical stresses during phonation. In particular, the contact {{pressure on the}} vocal fold medial surface is postulated to be one major source of <b>phonotrauma.</b> A knowledge of mechanical stresses within the vocal folds is required. A physical replica of the human vocal folds {{was used as a}} test bed to investigate mechanical stresses within the vocal folds during phonation. The validity of the physical replica was confirmed by comparing phonation onset characteristics obtained using a theoretical model with those from experimental observations through a series of tests. ^ Mechanical stresses within the physical replica were obtained using a tuned FEM model built based on experimental data. The FEM model allowed the extrapolation of deformation data that were not available from the experiment. Detailed stress and strain distributions on model surfaces were obtained. Maximum von Mises stresses were found on the medial and inferior surfaces when no vocal fold collision is involved. The fact that lesions seldom develop on the inferior surface, where von Mises stresses are the largest, suggest that stress states associated with vocal fold collisions play a more important role in lesion development. ^ A probe microphone was developed for direct contact pressure measurements. Indirect estimations including estimation based on a Hertzian impact model and a well-tuned FEM model were performed. These estimations were compared with the direct measurement data. The estimation based on the Hertzian impact model was found to be a good first cut estimate, although the temporal resolution of the contact pressure data is limited to the camera frame rate. The estimation based on the well-tuned FEM model was able to provide detailed information with high temporal and spatial resolution, but for a rather high computational cost. ^ The probe microphone was then used for in-vivo measurements of the contact and subglottal/supraglottal acoustic pressures. Contact pressures for breathy, normal and pressed voices were obtained. The overall contact pressure amplitudes were found to be smaller than those reported in previous studies due to the probe size. The probe microphone was found to be a robust tool for future clinical studies. ...|$|E
