These models are used to analyze a floor and to investigate the management of <b>paid-up</b> <b>policy</b> portfolios kept by life insurance companies. The main concerns are the current low-rate environment experienced {{in the financial markets}} today, and their exposure to negative interest rates. The two interest rate models are calibrated to the market using volatility factors. The HJM uses principal component analysis to find the volatility factors, while the LMM uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average. The <b>paid-up</b> <b>policy</b> portfolios are then analyzed using Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. We find that the probability of negative rates is clearly present in the HJM-framework, while it is zero in LMM because of the log-normal assumption. Further, we also see that the probability of negative rates are larger in the European market, compared to the Norwegian and US market. This in turn leads to significantly higher floor prices in the European market. The prices calculated with HJM and LMM deviates the most near the current spot rate, with HJM always giving higher floor prices than LMM. In the end we see that the European <b>paid-up</b> <b>policy</b> portfolios give less gain to the insurance companies compared to the Norwegian and US portfolios. The simulation also shows that a higher gain demand requires a larger share in the equity markets. This result is in line with the general yield hunting strategies observed in the market today...|$|E

In each case there are separate tables for males and females and, for 1941, tables (male and female) for Urban Areas. In a similar manner to Great Britain, the Insurance Act, 1936, prescribes the Eire Life Table No. 1 (Males) as the basis {{to be used in the}} calculation of free <b>paid-up</b> <b>policies</b> and of surrender values of industrial assurance policies, but no monetary functions have been published, except those given in a short illustrative paper of mine which was published in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries (Vol. 68, p. 168). To complete the picture, I should mention the unofficial regional life tables presented to this Society by Mr. Colm A. Barry on the 31 st October, 1941. I now propose briefly to survey the existing material, and to present certain new statistics and functions...|$|R
