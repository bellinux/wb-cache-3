25|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> {{called a}} primary for 25 December 2014, however, it was {{postponed}} until 6 January. After {{the election was}} called, the prime minister demanded a vote of the central committee to move it back up to 31 December. This was passed in a mini-referendum. The candidates were Netanyahu and former deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon.|$|E
25|$|A {{spate of}} suicide bombings {{reinforced}} the Likud position for security. Hamas {{claimed responsibility for}} most of the bombings. As <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.|$|E

25|$|On 31 May 2010, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> asked President Obama to veto any UN Security Council condemnations of Israel, but the {{president}} refused to comply. At the UN Security Council, the US subsequently blocked demands for an international inquiry into the raid and the criticism of Israel for allegedly violating international law, as proposed by Turkey, Palestine and Arab nations.|$|E
25|$|Yisrael Beiteinu, who {{ran in the}} 2013 {{elections}} on a joint party list with Likud, split from the party in July 2014, with analysts suggesting that {{it was due to}} policy disagreements between <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> and Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman, specifically regarding the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers and the ensuing conflict in Gaza. The party's poll numbers stayed relatively steady after the split from Likud, but began to slide in early 2015.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak {{repeated}} {{his support for}} the peace plan. He also stated that it does not mean recognizing Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, since that would imply giving up the right of return. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman also made similar statements and he called on the international community to push Israel towards accepting the peace plan. Both leaders had responded to an address by Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu.</b>|$|E

25|$|The May 1996 {{elections}} {{were the first}} featuring direct election {{of the prime minister}} and resulted in a narrow election victory for Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu. A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security. Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> continued their implementation, but his prime ministership saw a marked slow-down in the Peace Process. Netanyahu also pledged to gradually reduce U.S. aid to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Following Tzipi Livni's {{election}} to head Kadima and Olmert's resignation {{from the post}} of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> declined to join the coalition Livni was trying to form and supported new elections, which were held in February 2009. Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2009 Israeli legislative election which took place on 10 February 2009, as Livni, the previous Designated Acting Prime Minister under the Olmert government, {{had been unable to}} form a viable governing coalition. Opinion polls showed Likud in the lead, but with as many as a third of Israeli voters undecided.|$|E
25|$|Following the elections, {{the leaders}} of parties with seats in the Knesset gave their {{suggestions}} to President Reuven Rivlin as to which party leader {{should be given the}} task of forming a coalition. Kulanu, the Jewish Home, Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas and United Torah Judaism all joined the Likud in suggesting the incumbent <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu,</b> giving him the support of 67 of the 120 seats. The Zionist Union and Meretz both suggested Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog, giving him a total of 29 seats. Yesh Atid and the Joint List both chose to abstain and not suggest any party leader. These suggestions do not define who will, and will not, end up in a coalition: In Israel's 2013 election, Hatnuah did not suggest Netanyahu and joined his government, while the ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism both suggested Netanyahu, but did not join his coalition.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> asked Brody {{in early}} 2009 to help Israel in a yet-to-be-created {{official}} position of goodwill ambassador for the country.

2500|$|Eventually, {{the lack}} of {{progress}} {{of the peace process}} led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Netanyahu and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and on 17 November 1998, Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. As <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> emphasized a policy of [...] "three no(s)": no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.|$|E
2500|$|Under Berlusconi, Italy was {{an ally of}} Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu said of Berlusconi: [...] "We {{are lucky}} {{that there is a}} leader such as yourself. I don't believe we have a better friend in the {{international}} community." [...] Berlusconi has been noted for his close and friendly relationship with Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu.</b> Netanyahu describes Berlusconi as [...] " [...] one of the greatest friends". Berlusconi believed that Israel should be made an EU member, stating that [...] "My greatest desire, as long as I am a protagonist in politics, is to bring Israel into membership of the European Union". Berlusconi has strongly defended Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians, continuing his support for Israel after leaving office.|$|E
2500|$|The saying {{became a}} staple of Israeli speech. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin co-opted the phrase as an {{election}} campaign slogan in 1981. [...] It was also used by former Soviet refusenik and Israeli Yisrael BaAliyah party leader and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, in 1998. [...] The Israeli National Lottery Board spoofed it in a television commercial, in which a winning racehorse with an American accent stated: [...] "We are on the racetrack, and we will stay on the racetrack." [...] Similarly, when Israel's Davis Cup team beat the powerhouse Russian Davis Cup team in a shocking victory in the 2009 Davis Cup tennis quarter-finals, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Netanyahu</b> telephoned the Israel Tennis Association Director General and echoed Brody's statement of over three decades earlier, saying: [...] "We're back on the map".|$|E
