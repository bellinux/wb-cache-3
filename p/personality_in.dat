5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of <b>personality.</b> <b>In</b> the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime.

5|$|In 1836, Walter Savage Landor, an English {{writer and}} poet, {{published}} Pericles and Aspasia, {{one of his}} most famous books. Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the Age of Pericles. Robert Hamerling is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia's <b>personality.</b> <b>In</b> 1876 he published his novel Aspasia, a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi called this person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.|$|E

Sanosuke is also a playable character in almost all the Rurouni Kenshin video games except Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars, in which he isn't playable but is available as a Battle koma.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether Internet Financial Disclosure (IFD) can be {{explained}} by the elements of the company’s characteristics and dominant <b>personalities</b> <b>in</b> board committees. Ten variables have been tested using data collected from 194 Malaysian listed companies’ websites, namely, internationality, leverage, foreign shareholders, information technology (IT) experts, firm’s age, number of shareholders, listing status, dominant <b>personalities</b> <b>in</b> the audit committee, chairman of audit and nomination committees, and dominant <b>personalities</b> <b>in</b> the audit and nomination committees. It is found that IT experts, firm’s age, number of shareholders and listing status are significantly affected by the level of IFD. However dominant <b>personalities</b> <b>in</b> the audit and nomination committees are negatively related to the level of IFD in Malaysia. The study provides some evidence to support the signalling theory and the cost and benefit hypothesis in relation to Internet disclosure...|$|R

5|$|Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not {{the same}} character. Additionally, he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to {{distinguish}} Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true <b>personality.</b> <b>In</b> another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic <b>personality.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
