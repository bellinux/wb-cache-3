25|$|Law 10: Covering the pitch. The {{pitch is}} said to be 'covered' when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The Laws {{stipulate}} that the regulations on covering the pitch shall be agreed by both captains in advance. The decision concerning whether to cover the pitch greatly affects how the ball will react to the <b>pitch</b> <b>surface,</b> as a ball bounces differently on wet ground as compared to dry ground. The area beyond the pitch where a bowler runs so as to deliver the ball (the 'run-up') should ideally be kept dry so as to avoid injury through slipping and falling, and the Laws also require these to be covered wherever possible when there is wet weather.|$|E
25|$|If {{the catch}} taken is {{pronounced}} or obvious, the players need not {{appeal to the}} umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, {{in the event that}} the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the <b>pitch</b> <b>surface</b> (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.|$|E
40|$|Selected slewing {{bearings}} and their application {{have been described}} in this article. Basic causes of the damage <b>pitch</b> <b>surfaces</b> of slewing bearings have been analysed and examples of the damage have been presented as well. Special {{attention was paid to}} these kinds of damage which appeared most often {{in the case of the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the {{bearings and}} those ones which very often cause premature exchange of the bearing and its scrapping. On the basis of the conducted studies it was stated that the main cause of the damage toÂ  the <b>pitch</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the bearings is the excessive load of rolling elements. Based on the results of the conducted analysis, actions limiting the occurrence of the damage to the <b>pitch</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the bearings, which lead to their premature exchange, have been proposed. One of the suggested actions, limiting the premature exchange of bearings, is the necessity of exceptionally thorough design and selection of the slewing bearings, including the conditions of their foundatio...|$|R

5000|$|In England, it was commonplace since {{ancient times}} for flat stones {{with a flat}} narrow edge to be set on edge to provide an even paved surface. This {{was known as a}} 'pitched' surface and was common all over Britain, as it did not require rounded pebbles. <b>Pitched</b> <b>surfaces</b> predate the use of regularly-sized granite setts by more than a {{thousand}} years. Such pitched paving is quite distinct from that formed from rounded stones, although both forms are commonly referred to as 'cobbled' surfaces. Most surviving genuinely old 'cobbled' areas are in reality <b>pitched</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A cobbled area is known as a [...] "causey", [...] "cassay" [...] or [...] "cassie" [...] in Scots (probably from causeway).|$|R
2500|$|Another {{good example}} of seam bowling {{technique}} are the fast bowlers Courtney Walsh & Curtly Ambrose. [...] Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:. [...] Both Walsh & Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. [...] However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock & 7 o'clock position (if viewed {{from the bottom of}} the seam). [...] This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing & inswing seam positions through the air). [...] Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). [...] However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman). [...] It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. [...] This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the <b>pitch</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{document}} {{the limitations of}} isotropic textures in conveying three-dimensional shape. We measured the perceived shape and pitch of upright and <b>pitched</b> corrugated <b>surfaces</b> overlaid with different classes of isotropic textures: patterns containing isotropic texture elements, isotropically filtered noise patterns, and patterns containing ellipses or lines of all orientations. Frequency modulations arising from surface slant were incorrectly interpreted as changes in surface distance, resulting in concavities being misclassified as convexities, and right and left slants as concavities. In addition, images of <b>pitched</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibited oriented flows that confound surface shape and <b>surface</b> <b>pitch.</b> Observers related oriented flow patterns to particular surface shapes with a bias for perceiving convex surfaces. When concave and convex curvatures were concurrently visible, the number of correct shape classifications increased slightly. Isotropic textures thus convey correct 3 -D shapes of developable surfaces only in some conditions, and the same perceptual strategies lead to non-veridical percepts in other conditions...|$|R
