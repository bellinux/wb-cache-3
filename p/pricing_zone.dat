40|$|Abstract: We review {{explanations}} for two controversial vertical restraints {{commonly used in}} gasoline marketing: <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> and territorial restrictions. After {{a discussion of the}} relevant empirical and theoretical economics literature, we consider procompetitive and anticompetitive theories behind the practices. <b>Price</b> <b>zones</b> may be one part of a complicated relationship between gasoline marketers and retailers that facilitates efficient risk-sharing, provides optimal incentives for marketers and retailers, and allows marketers to react more quickly to changes in localized retail competition. Alternatively, if gasoline marketers have substantial market power, <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> may facilitate coordination or help deter entry. Territorial restrictions may prevent inefficiencies in distribution and reduce free-riding on investments marketers make in developing networks of retail stations. At the same time, territorial restrictions help marketers maintain <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> (with the same welfare implications), and may, if marketers have substantial market power, facilitate coordination.

40|$|Urban {{transport}} systems {{play a crucial}} role in maintaining sustainability. Recently, sustainable urban transportation has become a major research area. Most of these studies propose evaluation methods that use simulation tools to assess the sustainability of different transportation policies. Though there are some recent studies, the mathematical programming approaches to determine the optimal policies is still an open research area. The conventional mathematical programming techniques have been used in several transportation problems such as toll pricing and traffic assignment problems. We propose a bilevel structure for several optimization models that incorporate the measurement of gas emissions throughout a traffic network. The upper level of the problem represents the decisions of transportation managers that aim at making the {{transport systems}} sustainable, whereas the lower level problem represents the decisions of the network users that are assumed to choose their routes to minimize their total travel cost. By using emission factor tables provided by California Air Resources Board, we determine the emission functions in terms of traffic flow to reflect the accumulated emission amounts in case of congestion. The proposed emission functions are plugged into bilevel mathematical programming models that incorporate several policies, namely, toll <b>pricing,</b> <b>zone</b> charging and capacity enhancement.

40|$|Abstract — In 2003, {{the city}} of London {{implemented}} a conges-tion pricing policy {{in order to reduce}} traffic and raise revenues for transit improvements. The dramatic success of this system has led to widespread consideration of the adoption of such variable tolling, including road pricing, in dense urban cores around the world. While from many perspectives the broad implementation of such congestion pricing systems would be socially beneficial, the likely consequences for the privacy of motorists are extremely negative. A sophisticated congestion pricing strategy will assign a cost to a specific space-time path of a vehicle through the <b>pricing</b> <b>zone.</b> Straightforward implementations of monitoring systems to assess congestion tolls thus require detailed tracking technology to monitor the paths of each individual vehicle. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for computing congestion pricing tolls in a fashion that preserves driver pri-vacy. Our scheme uses cryptographic algorithms to guarantee that the state can collect arbitrarily nuanced congestion pricing tolls without being able to track the movements of individual drivers. That is, the system provides simultaneous guarantees that the state can correctly compute the tolls for a particular driver from the information it collects but that the state cannot reconstruct the path of the driver no matter what it does with this information. Our system is built using a variant of the protocol we described in a previous paper to handle automated traffic enforcement (i. e. stop-light violation detection) in a way that preserves driver privacy and eliminates camera use. The pro-tocol is relatively easy to implement with existing technology, and such implementation can be done in a fashion which is sufficiently robust to handle realistic operational requirements. In particular, we discuss methods for ensuring resistance to attempts to cheat and modifications to handle sporadic users (tourists). I...|$|E
40|$|The {{achievement}} of the internal market for energy is going ahead in the EU 15 since a model is emerging for “coupling the national markets for electricity”. For about 15 years the EU 15 {{was made up of}} national markets open to each other through rules of access to the grids while organized market pricing was kept national. The main exception was in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland and Denmark plus Norway –not a member of the EU). In this region the coupling of national markets is obtained through a single Power Exchange being a common subsidiary of the Nordic transmission system operators (TSOs). This single PX runs a single Day Ahead market <b>pricing</b> <b>zone</b> when the grid is not constrained and splits itself into different pricing areas when structural constraints arise. This model is known as “market splitting”. The Netherlands, Belgium and France did later create a less centralized single pricing mechanism by “coupling” their three national PXs with a common pricing algorithm coordinating the price formation among the three national exchanges. The empirical success of this new model has validated it as an EU model for other regional markets. A counter-model has been experimented between Germany and Denmark. It consisted of a coupling of “volumes” linking the quantities offered and demanded in the two exchanges while keeping the price formation in these two markets separated. That experiment failed and started to work again only when elements of price coupling have been introduced. Having now three workable models of market coupling, the European Union (at least EU 15) should be able to successfully achieve one layer of its internal market soon. However, several further questions are kept open such as how to successfully bridge several regional markets all over the EU 15 or how to integrate more and more PXs having different regulatory frames. A centralized approach (known as CMU) is advocating creating a single pan-European trading entity by a mandatory restructuring of all existing PXs plus a clubbing of all TSOs and the extensive harmonization of all existing national regulatory frames. An alternative approach is the one known as PCR (“Price Coupling of Regions”). It allows building a less demanding common pricing mechanism to coordinate existing PXs in a decentralized network. It is permitting grid access and trading to keep a national flavour when requested by particular local preferences. market coupling; market splitting; power exchange; electricity internal market; day ahead market...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According to the European Commission, Svenska Kraftnät, the Swedish network operator, {{might have}} {{violated}} competition rules by limiting cross-border transmission capacity {{to relieve congestion}} within Sweden. Eventually, the case was settled and Svenska Kraftnät offered commitments to address the Commission’s concerns. As an interim remedy, it committed to reduce transmission flow of electricity on internal network bottlenecks primarily by introducing national measures and by not reducing interconnection capacity. As a final remedy, Svenska Kraftnät agreed to split the Swedish market into multiple <b>price</b> <b>zones.</b> Congestion within Sweden would then be solved by adjusting the <b>prices</b> of those <b>zones.</b> We analyse the economic effects of the alleged abuse and the remedy package. We make three observations. Firstly, it might be socially optimal to reduce cross-border capacity in response to internal congestion. Hence, without an in-depth economic analysis the Commission risked preventing efficient behaviour. Secondly, the interim remedy of handling internal congestion primarily by national measures is not socially optimal, and it cannot be ruled out that it reduces overall welfare. Thirdly, even though splitting the market into <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> may improve allocative efficiency within Sweden, it does not prevent Svenska Kraftnät from potential manipulation of cross-border transmission capacity. ...|$|R

40|$|Amid growing {{recognition}} {{of the costs of}} downtown congestion and scarcity of revenues for new roads, congestion pricing for downtown areas [...] a practice we call “zone pricing” [...] has begun to receive wide attention. From 1975 - 2003, <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> failed to spread beyond Singapore, but by the 2000 ’s technological advances had made the practice more widely practical. Now London, Stockholm, Milan and Gothenburg have schemes of their own, and <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> is on the agenda in many world cities. The research summarized in this report has sought to advance practical knowledge of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> in several ways. First, we have created a very detailed, scholarly history of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing,</b> covering the circumstances under which cities have implemented <b>zone</b> <b>pricing,</b> what technologies have been used and what results these cities have obtained. Second, we investigated the theory of “usage tolls. ” A drawback of all tradition <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> systems is that, for practical reasons, they fail to charge different tolls to drivers who use the network to different degrees: someone who enters the downtown and immediately parks pays the same toll as someone who circles for an hour. But with new technology {{it will be possible to}} charge drivers for some index of road use, such as how far or how long they travel inside the network. Our research highlights two major advantages of usage tolling: (i) it can reschedule trips in optimal ways; (ii) it can discourage long trips [...] such as those traveling across the downtown between points outside [...] from happening by car in the first place. In both cases, an interesting result is the added precision of usage tolls means congestion reduction can be accomplished while charging drivers relatively little. We cite this as a political advantage that will help make <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> more palatable...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implications}} of two <b>price</b> <b>zones,</b> i. e. one northern and southern bidding area, on the German electricity market. In the northern zone, continuous capacity additions with low variable costs cause large regional supply surpluses in the market dispatch while conventional capacity decreases in the southern zone. As the spatial imbalance of supply and load is increasing, the current single bidding area results more often in technically infeasible market results requiring curative congestion management. Additional bidding zones would enable better market integration of scarce transmission capacities in a system exposed to structural regional imbalances. Using a line sharp electricity sector model, this paper analyzes the system implications and the distributional effects of two bidding zones in the German electricity system in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Results show a decrease in cross-zonal re-dispatch levels, in particular in 2015. However, overall network congestion and re-dispatch levels increase in 2015 and also remain high for both bidding zones. Results {{are very sensitive to}} additional line investments illustrating the challenge to define stable <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> in a dynamic setting. With two bidding areas, prices in the model results increase in the southern zone and decrease in the northern <b>zone.</b> The average <b>price</b> deviation grows from 0. 4 EUR/MWh in 2012 to 1. 7 EUR/MWh in 2015 with absolute values being significantly higher in hours with price differences.

40|$|Abstract: In November 2011 Sweden {{abolished}} the uniform national electricity price and introduced separate <b>price</b> <b>zones.</b> This {{was the result}} of an antitrust settlement between the Commission and the Swedish network operator, which was accused of discriminating between domestic and export electricity transmission services and segmenting the internal market.

We find that, even though the Commission’s action under competition rules was contrived and lacked economic depth, the commitment package provides an economically sound, longterm solution to network access and congestion management in Sweden. Such a quick and far-reaching change of Swedish congestion management could not have been achieved by Swedish policymakers or enforcement of the EU sector-specific regulation. ...|$|R
