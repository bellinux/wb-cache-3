25|$|In 1916, on the New York Giants' road uniforms, purple lines {{gave their}} uniforms a tartan-like effect, and {{another kind of}} road uniform was a solid dark blue or black {{material}} with white around this time. The Kansas City Athletics' home and road uniforms were changed by Charles O. Finley in 1963, to the colors of gold and green. Some teams used light blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Early striped patterns developed into long stripes {{along the length of}} the uniforms, called <b>pinstriping.</b> This was first worn on some major league baseball team's uniforms in 1907, and the pinstripes were then widened in 1912, so that the crowd could see them more clearly.|$|E
25|$|Harris mainly plays a specially-painted Fender Precision Bass, {{featured}} on every Iron Maiden album, which {{has gone through}} a total of four colour changes since he began using it. Originally white, it was then changed to black prior to the band's first album, followed by blue sparkle and finally white with claret and blue <b>pinstriping</b> with the West Ham United F.C. crest. Harris has had his bass modified to include a mirrored scratchplate, Badass bridges and Seymour Duncan custom SPB-1 pickups and uses his own signature set of RotoSound flatwound strings. In 2009, Fender issued a signature Steve Harris Precision bass, featuring an alder body, a blue-sparkle finish, mirrored scratchplate, Seymour Duncan SPB-1 pickups and a Badass II bridge. In 2015, Fender released a revised model of the signature bass, which now features a maple body, a white finish with blue pinstripes and the West Ham crest, a Fender High Mass bridge and a Seymour Duncan SPB-4 Steve Harris signature pickup.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pinstriping</b> brush is {{the tool}} of {{traditional}} free hand pinstripers use for <b>pinstriping.</b> Freehand <b>pinstriping</b> {{is the most}} difficult method of <b>pinstriping</b> and the brush is an important tool for design. <b>Pinstriping</b> brushes have several different designs, Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line brushes. The brush consists of a small wood dowel handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and brush hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small wood dowel is balanced so pinstripers can freely spin the brush between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the brush does not hit the palm of the hand while the brush is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a <b>pinstriping</b> brush is relatively long at approximately 2 inches,or more, compared to most artistic brushes of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line.|$|E
