5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E

Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global <b>phenomenon.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Flemish Movement had become an increasing <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E
5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> the East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally {{involved in the}} crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E

5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return for military service. Most likely each community was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return for military service was not a new <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> the 4th century: it stretches {{back to the days of}} Augustus. But it does appear that the establishment of military settlements was more systematic and on a much larger scale in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|The winds on Saturn are {{the second}} fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data {{indicate}} peak easterly winds of 500m/s (1800km/h). In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known {{example of such a}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185°C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122°C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.|$|E
