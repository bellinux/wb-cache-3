Results are presented for the special cases of midamble, and preamble and <b>postamble,</b> pilot-symbol insertion. The derivation reveals that the CRLB {{is a function of}} the location of the reference symbols in the burst, the number of reference symbols, the number of data symbols, the signal-to-noise ratio and the data-modulation scheme. By distributing the reference symbols symmetrically about the center of the burst and analyzing relative to the middle of the signal vector, the joint frequency and phase estimation can be decoupled, and the optimal phase estimation is achieved. In the decoupled case, the phase CRLB is independent of the location of reference symbols in the burst. In a symmetrical burst, the use of a preamble and <b>postamble</b> is found to provide a lower frequency-estimation CRLB than that with a midamble. It appears that the frequency CRLB is reduced as the reference symbols are symmetrically distributed closer to the ends of the burst. Feng Ric...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel method for detection, synchronization, and Doppler scale {{estimation}} for underwater acoustic communication using orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) waveforms. The method involves transmitting two identical OFDM symbols {{together with a}} cyclic prefix, while the receiver uses a bank of parallel self-correlators matched to different Doppler scaling factors on waveform dilation or compression. We characterize the receiver operating characteristic in terms of probability of false alarm and probability of detection, and analyze the impact of Doppler scale estimation accuracy on the data transmission performance. We have tested the proposed method with real data from an experiment at Buzzards Bay, MA, Dec. 15, 2006. Using only one OFDM preamble, the proposed method achieves performance similar to an existing method that uses two linearly-frequency-modulated (LFM) waveforms, one as a preamble and the other as a <b>postamble.</b> Avoiding the need of buffering the whole data packet before data demodulation, the proposed method enables online receiver operation.

40|$|Copyright 2005 IEEEThis paper derives {{the true}} Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) on the {{individual}} phase estimation and the coupled carrier phase and frequency estimation for transmission bursts with pilot-assisted PSK/QAM modulation. The reduction in frequency and phase CRLB due to introduction of embedded reference symbols increases as the modulation order increases. It is found that the better CRLB may be obtained if the reference symbols are distributed symmetrically in the burst, especially using a preamble and <b>postamble.</b> At low SNR, 5 % pilot symbols in the burst reduces the bound on the phase standard deviation {{by a factor of}} 10 for QPSK or higher order modulated signals. The new CRLB for distributed pilot symbols are also presented. The comparison of the true CRLB and the CRLB of the pilot symbols has revealed that using only pilot symbols for estimation is an effective approach only if more than 5 % of pilot symbols are in the burst and SNR ≤ 0 dB...|$|E

Test purposes are used in practice to select test cases according to some properties of the specification. We define a consistency preorder linking test purposes and specifications.

The algorithm, which implements the construction rules, is based on a depth first traversal of a synchronous product between the test purpose and the specification.

Specifically, we consider a wireless system with multiple antennas at the base station and a number of mobile terminals each with a single antenna. We analyze the performance of uplink multiuser detection and downlink transmitter optimization that are based on linear spatial filtering. Using a discrete version of the continuously time-varying wireless channel we analyze how a lower bound on the achievable data rates depends on (1) the arrangement of pilot symbols (preamble or postamble); (2) the duration of the uplink and downlink transmissions; and (3) the percentage power allocated to the pilot. Furthermore, we also present the effects of the terminal speeds on the achievable data rates, thereby providing prescriptions for the practical design of the pilot.

40|$|In this work, {{we discuss}} {{techniques}} for coherently detecting turbo coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals, transmitted through frequency selective Rayleigh (the magnitude of each channel tap is Rayleigh distributed) fading channels having a uniform power delay profile. The channel output is further distorted by a carrier frequency and phase offset, besides additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A new frame structure for OFDM, {{consisting of a}} known preamble, cyclic prefix, data and known <b>postamble</b> is proposed, which has a higher throughput compared to the earlier work. A robust turbo decoder is proposed, which functions effectively {{over a wide range}} of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The key contribution to the good performance of the practical coherent receiver is due to the use of a long preamble (512 QPSK symbols), which is perhaps not specified in any of the current wireless communication standards. We have also shown from computer simulations that, it is possible to obtain even better BER performance, using a better code. A simple and approximate Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of the frequency offset estimation error for coherent detection, is derived. The proposed algorithms are well suited for implementation on a DSP-platform. Comment: 15 pages, 16 figures, 3 table...|$|E

40|$|Bit errors {{occur in}} {{wireless}} communication when interference or noise overcomes the coded and modulated transmission. Current wireless protocols may use {{forward error correction}} (FEC) to correct some small number of bit errors, but generally retransmit the whole packet if the FEC is insufficient. We observe that current wireless mesh network protocols retransmit a number of packets and {{that most of these}} retransmissions end up sending bits that have already been received multiple times, wasting network capacity. To overcome this inefficiency, we develop, implement, and evaluate a partial packet recovery (PPR) system. PPR incorporates two new ideas: (1) SoftPHY, an expanded physical layer (PHY) interface that provides PHY-independent hints to higher layers about the PHY’s confidence in each bit it decodes, and (2) a <b>postamble</b> scheme to recover data even when a packet preamble is corrupted and not decodable at the receiver. Finally, we present PP-ARQ, an asynchronous link-layer ARQ protocol built on PPR that allows a receiver to compactly encode a request for retransmission of only those bits in a packet that are likely in error. Our experimental results from a 31 -node Zigbee (802. 15. 4) testbed that includes Telos motes with 2. 4 GHz Chipcon radios and GNU Radio nodes implementing the 802. 15. 4 standard show that PP-ARQ increases end-to-end capacity by a factor of 2 × under moderate load...|$|E
40|$|Algorithms used to {{estimate}} {{the influence of the}} medium on the transmitted data signal in an OFDM system typically incorporate one or more known symbols, called preamble, in front of each data stream [1]. An estimate of the channel transfer function is most easily obtained by ˆ Hm(kPre) = Ym(kPre) /Xm(kPre), where Ym(kPre) and Xm(kPre) are the received signal and the transmitted data of the preamble at the m-th subcarrier. An equalization of the received data of a packet-oriented transmission is then carried out by using these instantaneous estimates on all following payload symbols Y(k), where k is the symbol counter. The performance of this kind of equalization is quite limited, if the channel transfer function changes considerably during the transmission of the payload, be it because of high terminal velocities or long payloads. Therefore semiblind channel estimation has been suggested, where the initial estimates obtained from the preamble are further improved on the payload. We examined the possibility to use additional existing known data of the physical layer of a Wireless LAN system, like IEEE 802. 11 a, for channel estimation [2], [3]. Under consideration of the coding process at the transmitter we propose to use the so-called “Tail-Bits ” and the “Pad-Bits”, which finalize the data unit of the physical layer, for channel estimation.
