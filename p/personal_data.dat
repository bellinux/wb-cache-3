5|$|At least 31mass graves were {{discovered}} in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed {{that the number of}} victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some {{estimates of the number of}} those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21stOctober Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> of 2,794victims.

5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored.

A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' <b>personal</b> <b>data.</b> He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E

In this paper, we make a call for <b>personal</b> semantic <b>data</b> integration, i. e., semantic data integration whose results precisely fit individual needs and preferences. We classify problems that make a single global schema inappropriate for particular users, and introduce the ASME criteria as prerequisites for <b>personal</b> semantic <b>data</b> integration. We then outline <b>personal</b> semantic <b>data</b> integration in the SIRUP approach. Our goal is to stimulate research into personally tailored data integration and to develop new solutions which improve the usability of integrated data. I...|$|R

40|$|Computer users {{deal with}} large numbers of {{personal}} media objects such as images, audio clips, voice mails, video clips, web pages, emails, and various document files. Users often struggle to interpret, explore, arrange, and use personal media objects because of three major problems; an ever increasing amount of <b>personal</b> media <b>data,</b> rigid organizing metaphor, and difficulty in rapid data access. With the progress of computer hardware and digitization technologies at the rate of Moore's law, users may generate, acquire, and store more and more <b>personal</b> media <b>data</b> on their <b>personal</b> machines. However, the means available for users to organize and customize their personal media information spaces are extremely poor and driven mostly by storage and distribution models, not users' needs. Furthermore, this rigid and system-oriented metaphor causes wide and deep file folder hierarchies and often forbids users to rapid data access from storage. This dissertation uses a graphical mechanism for spatially organizing <b>personal</b> media <b>data</b> based on users' mental models and introduces an innovative interaction metaphor to apply users' mental models to <b>personal</b> media <b>data.</b> Semantic Regions introduces an innovative way to construct users' mental models by drawing regions on 2 D space and specifying the semantics for each region so that users can apply various personal ontologies to <b>personal</b> media <b>data</b> using the fling-and-flock metaphor. The prototype application, MediaFinder, validates the usability of the interface, particularly in comparison with alternative approaches. Contributions of this dissertation include: - Semantic Regions provides a formal model of spatial and dynamic reorganization of <b>personal</b> media <b>data</b> based on users' mental models. It extends the concept from a system-oriented file management system to a user-oriented personal media management system by employing the semantics of <b>personal</b> media <b>data.</b> - The MediaFinder personal media management tool, which uses Semantic Regions, the fling-and-flock metaphor, and flexible categorization capabilities to explore and manage <b>personal</b> media <b>data</b> sets. MediaFinder's object-oriented architecture can easily be extended to support variants of the Semantic Regions model. - The design and implementation of interaction models that support the personal media management tasks such as organization, meaning extraction, navigation, search, indexing, and navigation. - Two usability studies provided preliminary insight into the utility of Semantic Regions and led to design improvements for the construction and operation of Semantic Regions. - A framework for extending the Semantic Regions model, including the descriptions of possible extensions...|$|R
