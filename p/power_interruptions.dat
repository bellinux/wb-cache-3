5|$|Winds from Hurricane Erika {{peaked at}} 37mph (60km/h) with {{a gust of}} 47mph (76km/h) in the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands {{produced}} light to moderate rainfall in the Virgin Islands, peaking at 3.28inches (83mm) at the University of the Virgin Islands in Saint Thomas and 1.32inches (36mm) in Saint John. The precipitation produced localized street flooding, while the combination of winds and rain caused <b>power</b> <b>interruptions.</b> Offshore, strong waves capsized one dinghy and broke a 50-foot (15m) boat from its moorings. On Saint Croix, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 25mph (40km/h) and a peak wind gust of 29mph (46km/h) at the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport. Rainfall on the island was light, peaking at 0.83inches (21mm) at Christiansted. The wind gusts downed a few power lines, and damage was minor.|$|E

40|$|Electron {{density and}} {{temperature}} measurements during a <b>power</b> <b>interruption</b> of the generator are performed on a 100 -MHz flowing-argon inductively coupled plasma. The Thomson scattering setup {{for measuring the}} density and temperature is triggered {{in such a way}} that temperatures and densities are obtained as a function of time while the power is interrupted. The response of the electron temperature to the <b>power</b> <b>interruption</b> shows a jump downwards within 5 µs, presumably towards the heavy particle temperature. Therefore, the method can be used to determine the heavy particle temperature. Furthermore, insight is obtained as to the behavior of the electron density in the center of the plasma; it increases rather than decreases after the <b>power</b> <b>interruption...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of inductively coupled plasmas for spectroscopic purposes {{has been studied}} extensively in the past. However, many questions about production and loss of electrons, which have a major effect on this behavior, are unanswered. <b>Power</b> <b>interruption</b> is a powerful diagnostic method to study such processes. This paper presents time resolved Thomson scattering measurements of the electron density ne and temperature Te in an inductively coupled argon plasma during and after <b>power</b> <b>interruption.</b> In {{the center of the}} plasma the measured temporal development of ne and Te can be attributed to ambipolar diffusion, three-particle recombination and ionization. However, {{at the edge of the}} plasma an additional electron loss process must be involved. In addition, the high electron temperature during <b>power</b> <b>interruption</b> indicates the presence of an electron heating mechanism. The energy gain by recombination processes is shown to be insufficient to explain this electron heating. These discrepancies may be explained by the formation and destruction of molecular argon ions, which can be present in significant quantitie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Reliability cost/worth {{analysis}} {{involves an}} assessment of the costs of providing reliable service and a separate quantification of the worth of having that service. Uninterrupted electric power supply is a desire of a customer, although it is not realistic. For interruption costs assessments to be specific, they should obtain information that is customer specific. The customer survey approach {{is based on the assumption}} that the customer is in the best position to estimate the losses resulting from a <b>power</b> <b>interruption.</b> This customer survey approach presents a method to quantify the loss of the customers into monetary terms, due to electric <b>power</b> <b>interruption.</b> the major contribution of this paper, using survey method it is not only possible to obtain absolute <b>power</b> <b>interruption</b> costs for different customers but also shows the variation in interruption costs with the variation in interruption duration for each type of customer. Hence, these cost calculations can be further be used for the evaluation of other cost worth indices which will be useful for the future/reinforcement options for the reliability worth...|$|R

The optimized diagnostics show the same behavior for the electron density and temperature. Nevertheless, the Thomson scattering diagnostic is the best at retrieving the radial profile. The heavy particle temperature, as measured by using both Rayleigh scattering and diode laser absorption, is identical within the estimated errors.
