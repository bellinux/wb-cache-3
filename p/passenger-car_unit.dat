40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} studying factors that influence saturation flow at signalized intersections in Kelang Valley. In this study local drivers and vehicles characteristics, geometric design and traffic regulations are taken into considerations. The {{results show that the}} relationship introduced by Webster and Cohbe, gives an underestimated value of saturation flow at any given approach. Comparison between three most frequently used models i. e. Webster and Cohhe, Akcelik and Ellson and Kimber shows that Kimber model gives a more realistic estimation of the effects of turning radius magnitude and percentage of turning vehicles on the local saturation flow. <b>Passenger-car</b> <b>unit</b> values recommended by Webster and Cohbe give a close estimation to real conditions for all types of vehicles except for buse...|$|E
