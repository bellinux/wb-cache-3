5|$|Bone Copse, {{which was}} named in 2005, {{was started by}} the Bone family in 1988 by {{purchasing}} and <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> tree from the park authorities in memory of Bessie Bone who died in that year. Trees have been added annually, and in 1994 her husband Frederick Bone also died. The annual planting has been continued by their children.|$|E

5|$|To {{make it up}} to Seth and Munchie, Homer {{creates a}} new type of juice with crops from their garden and {{distributes}} them to every store in town. However, the Peyote ingredient makes anyone who drinks the juice hallucinate. Chief Wiggum catches on and soon the police surround the farm. Homer defends Seth, Munchie and the hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> flower in each of the officer's guns. However, Wiggum discharges his, lodging its flower in Homer's forehead and leaving him hospitalized.|$|E

50|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, Petone was a thriving, largely working-class {{town and}} the {{location}} of several large industrial sites, including two car assembly <b>plants,</b> <b>a</b> meat processing <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> wool processing <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> tobacco processing <b>plant,</b> <b>a</b> soap factory and a toothpaste factory. The majority of these closed in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in gradual economic decline. Petone Borough amalgamated with Lower Hutt {{as a result of the}} local government reform in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> spy among the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E

5|$|The folk worship {{representation}} of Shashthi is a red-coloured stone {{about the size}} of a human head, typically placed beneath a banyan tree such as those usually found on the outskirts of villages. The banyan may be decorated with flowers or strewn with rice and other offerings. Shashthi is also commonly represented by <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> banyan tree or a small branch in the soil of a family's home garden. Other common representations of the goddess include a Shaligrama stone, an earthen water pitcher, or a Purna Ghata – a water vase with an arrangement of coconut and mango leaves – generally set beneath a banyan tree.|$|E
5|$|On {{the world}} of Therum, Shepard rescues Benezia's {{daughter}} Liara T'Soni, who joins Shepard's squad because of her biotic abilities and expertise of the Protheans. On the colony of Feros, Shepard fights off Saren's forces and learns that his flagship, Sovereign, possesses unique mind-control capabilities. On {{the world of}} Noveria, Shepard tracks down and defeats Benezia, who reveals that she and Saren are being indoctrinated by Sovereign. After completing these missions, the Council informs Shepard that a salarian infiltration unit has uncovered Saren's main base on Virmire. Upon arrival, Shepard learns that Saren has discovered a cure for the krogan genetic disease, the genophage, and plans to breed an army of unstoppable krogan warriors. Wrex clashes with Shepard over whether to destroy it, which results in him either standing down or being executed. After this conflict, Shepard assists the salarians in destroying the base by <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> bomb in it. Inside, Shepard is confronted by Sovereign, who reveals itself to be an actual Reaper.|$|E
5|$|While {{driving through}} {{a rural area}} in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more {{offended}} by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out one of their headlights and then <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where {{they are forced to}} perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay in the jail supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay has been extended an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides {{to break out of the}} prison when the prison guards's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and shackle keys.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the orders}} of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had {{constructed}} {{a large number of}} static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty percent of the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel's asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops. Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of one area, that a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery's command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti-tank ditch.|$|E
