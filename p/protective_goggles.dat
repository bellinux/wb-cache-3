25|$|Patients {{are usually}} given {{a course of}} {{antibiotic}} and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally <b>protective</b> <b>goggles</b> to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to moisturize the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions for prescription drops. Occasionally after the procedure a bandage contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3–4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons {{of the importance of}} proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications.|$|E

2500|$|Bentazon {{has been}} {{classified}} by the EPA as a [...] "Group E" [...] chemical, {{because it is}} believed to be non-carcinogenic to humans (as based on testing conducted on animals). However, there are no studies or experiments that can determine toxic and/or carcinogenic effects of bentazon on humans. Workers applying the herbicide would be most exposed to bentazon, and so have been advised to wear <b>protective</b> clothing (<b>goggles,</b> gloves and aprons) at all times when handling the chemical. Bentazon causes allergy-like symptoms as it irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Ingesting bentazon causes nausea, diarrhoea, trembling, vomiting and difficulty breathing. Workers handling bentazon must wash their hands before eating, drinking, smoking, and using the bathroom to minimize contact with skin.|$|R
50|$|DYE Precision, {{also known}} as simply DYE, is a paintball {{equipment}} manufacturing company based in California. Dave Dehaan started the company by producing barrels for paintball markers, using his garage as a workshop.

From these humble beginnings, DYE went on to become an International concern that went on to manufacture an extensive range of paintball markers, loaders, playing & casual clothing, <b>protective</b> gear, <b>goggles</b> and luggage. Their range of products is updated each year. In 2005, the company was praised as one of the industry's largest paintball manufacturers. The company has offices in London, Taiwan and Germany.|$|R
25|$|Shielding from {{gamma rays}} {{requires}} {{large amounts of}} mass, in contrast to alpha particles, which can be blocked by paper or skin, and beta particles, which can be shielded by foil. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area {{in the path of}} the gamma ray. For this reason, a lead shield is only modestly better (20–30% better) as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material, such as aluminium, concrete, water, or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. <b>Protective</b> clothing, <b>goggles</b> and respirators can protect from internal contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection from gamma radiation from external sources.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{new coach}} Terry Porter, the Suns {{struggled}} early in 2008-09 with his system and lost five {{games in a}} row heading into the 2009 All-Star break. Stoudemire was voted a starter for the Western Conference. On February 19, in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Stoudemire suffered a detached retina, although he may have injured it earlier as he had been bothered by the same eye even before this game [...] He had injured the same eye in preseason, although this injury involved a partially torn iris, with no damage to his retina. He said then {{that he would have to}} wear <b>protective</b> <b>goggles</b> for the rest of his career, but stopped wearing them after seven games. Stoudemire underwent eye surgery to repair the retina. The recovery took eight weeks, which forced him to miss the remainder of the regular season. He announced that he would wear <b>protective</b> <b>goggles</b> when he returned to play the following season.|$|E
50|$|Activities {{which require}} a <b>protective</b> mask, safety <b>goggles,</b> or fully {{enclosing}} protective helmet can also {{result in an}} experience approximating tunnel vision. Underwater diving masks using a single flat transparent lens usually have the lens surface several centimeters from the eyes. The lens is typically enclosed with an opaque black rubber sealing shell to keep out water. For this type of mask the peripheral field of the diver is extremely limited. Generally, the peripheral field of a diving mask is improved if the lenses are {{as close to the}} eye as possible, or if the lenses are large, multi-window, or is a curved wrap-around design.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that people avoid contact if possible. Avoid breathing dusts, and fumes from burning or reacting material. Wear appropriate chemical <b>protective</b> gloves and <b>goggles.</b> Do not handle broken packages unless wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Wash away any material which may have contacted the body with copious amounts of water or soap and water. Do not store near other chemicals (especially other oxidizers), near sources of heating, or places where rapid temperature changes may occur. In case of spillage immediately soak with water and carefully and slowly clean up. In case of fire let burn; DO NOT attempt {{to put out the}} resulting fire. In any case where the compound is ingested call Poison Control Center immediately.|$|R
50|$|Airsoft is {{relatively}} safe when played with proper protection. Most airsoft {{guns on the}} market are usually below 350 ft/s, but projectiles expelled from any type of airsoft guns can travel as low as 65 ft/s to more than 700 ft/s and are capable of breaking skin at 300 ft/s. For example, skirmish play in the United Kingdom has a maximum of 350 ft/s, with some airsoft locations having a limit as low as 290 ft/s. If under 300 ft/s, the hit {{would have to be}} within a short range. Blood can be drawn, but injuries that do occur are predominantly superficial. Full-seal <b>protective</b> eyewear (<b>goggles</b> or glasses) is widely considered the minimum protection for airsoft players, as the eyes may be injured by any type of impact. The least amount of protection a player should seek will meet or exceed ANSI/ISEA Z87.1 standards, which indicates the eyewear is rated for ballistic strikes. Mesh eyewear has also seen some limited use by players due to low cost and its inability to fog, although it has drawn some criticism for its non-impact rated construction and vulnerability to debris. Some impacts (particularly at close range with powerful guns) are capable of cracking or damaging teeth. Dentists have reported broken teeth that require root canal and crowns to repair damage. A face mask (like that used for paintball) is recommended to protect eyes and teeth. Metallic mesh masks and mouth guards have recently seen popular use.|$|R
