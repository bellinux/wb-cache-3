5|$|There {{have been}} too few <b>published</b> <b>studies</b> on the {{etymology}} of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so {{the origin of the}} figure remains unproven.|$|E

40|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> are a fairly {{well-established}} field of research as well as of higher education. Not least since this {{is not so much the}} case in continental Europe, the <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> community increasingly sees a more elaborated self-concept as an important prerequisite for a prosperous further development of the field in research as well as in teaching. This paper starts off by relating the question for an advanced self-concept of <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> to the question what criteria have to be fulfilled to call a field (like <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies)</b> a scholarly discipline. As the second source for the possible formation of a more elaborate self-concept, the paper presents the first results of an ongoing empirical research project. In this projects, extensive expert interviews with representatives of UK <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> study programs and research institutions are evaluated to shed light on the core questions related to <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> as a discipline / „discipline“ in a bottom-up manner. After presenting a very clear and differentiated North American view as an additional point of reference, a contribution to the discussion on <b>Publishing</b> <b>Studies</b> is proposed...|$|R
