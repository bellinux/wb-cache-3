Prior to the formation of the Community Board in the early 1990s, the Everhart had a series of directors during the 1990s and early 2000s who often had no previous museum experience and no education or background in the fine arts, which resulted in years of mismanagement that put the museum in dire financial condition. The issue came to a head in 2001-02 when then-curator Bruce Lanning refused an order from the Everhart's Board of Trustees directing him to pack up the Matisse to be shipped to Sotheby's where it was to be offered in a public auction, a move that cost him his position at the Everhart.|$|E

40|$|The California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) has the {{authority}} to require one or any combination of Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) types in the trawl fishery within California waters for Pacific ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani), most commonly referred to as <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The purpose of this report is to provide the Commission with the best available information about the BRDs used in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawl fishery. The mandatory requirement for BRDs occurred in California in 2002, and in Oregon and Washington in 2003, resulting from an effort to minimize bycatch of overfished and quota managed groundfish species. Three types of BRDs currently satisfy the requirement for this device in the California fishery: 1) the Nordmøre grate (rigid-grate excluder); 2) soft-panel excluder; and 3) fisheye excluder; however, the design, specifications, and efficacy differ by BRD type. Although no data has been collected on BRDs directly from the California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery, extensive research on the efficacy and differences among BRD types has been conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) since the mid- 1990 s. Rigid-grate excluders are widely considered to be the most effective of the three BRD types at reducing groundfish bycatch. Over 90 percent of the Oregon <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet use rigid-grate excluders. The majority of the current California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet also uses rigid-grate excluders, according to a telephone survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) in 2007 - 2008 of <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishermen who have been active in the California fishery in recent years. Hinged rigid-grate excluders have been developed in recent years to reduce the bending of the BRD on vessels that employ net reels to stow and deploy their trawl nets, and they have been used successfully on both single- and double-rig vessels in Oregon. Soft-panel excluders have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing groundfish bycatch, although excessive shrimp loss and other problems have also been associated with this design. Fisheye excluders have been used in the California fishery in the past, but they were disapproved in Oregon and Washington in 2003 because they were found to be less effective at reducing groundfish bycatch than other designs. The reputation of the United States west coast <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery as one of the cleanest shrimp fisheries in the world is largely attributed to the effectiveness of BRDs at reducing groundfish bycatch. Nevertheless, BRD research and development is still a relatively new field and additional modifications and methods may further reduce bycatch rates in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery.

40|$|The Patos Lagoon estuary is an {{important}} environment for {{the life cycle of}} many species, including the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Farfantepenaeus paulensis. This area acts as a nursery ground for the shrimp larvae, which are spawned in a coastal area and transported into the lagoon during spring and early summer (September to December). Harvesting of shrimp occurs from January to May, and yields have varied from around 1, 000 to 8, 000 tons year− 1. This study is based on analysis of river discharge, <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches, and wind velocity time series from 1964 to 2004. Negative correlation between <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches and river runoff reflects the influence of discharge on the lagoon circulation and, consequently, on the intrusion of salt water and larvae. When river discharge is below average, landward currents forced by SW winds can enhance larval transport into the estuarine area, leading to an increase in <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> captures. Above average river input would force a seaward flow that works as a barrier to ingress of larvae. This is unusual when compared to many other estuarine systems, and the main factor that accounts for this behavior is the morphology (choking) of Patos Lagoon. Interannual variability related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation events also influence <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> production in this area. Low/high shrimp catches are related to El Niño(flood) /La Niña (drought) events. Wind can also impact production through its effect on the southward displacement of larvae from the spawning area.

40|$|Abstract The spatio-temporal {{distribution}} of juveniles of the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimps</b> Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis (Latreille, 1817) and Farfantepenaeus paulensis (Pérez-Farfante, 1967) in the Ubatuba region (SP) was investigated. Sampling {{was performed in}} the bays of Ubatumirim (UBM), Ubatuba (UBA) and Mar Virado (MV). A total of 2, 018 F. brasiliensis and F. paulensis were collected. The largest catch of juveniles of both species occurred in UBA (N = 867), followed by UBM (N = 729) and MV (N= 422). The bottom sediment in MV had the highest silt and clay content, which explains the negative correlation of the substrate with the abundance of both species. Temperature {{was positively correlated with}} the abundance of both species. Juveniles were highly abundant in shallower areas in the summer of 1998. The high rainfall in this El Niño period may have lowered the salinity in estuarine waters and led the shrimps to move to coastal areas in search of higher salinities such as in bays. With this unusually early reduction in salinity, individuals migrated to the bay before the closed season began and thus became more exposed to fishing. We confirmed that monitoring environmental variations, especially in El Niño years, is essential for understanding the distribution patterns of juveniles of both species...|$|E
40|$|Deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) is an {{important}} commercial species in Portugal with a catch volume over 1000 tons and a high market value, estimated in 2000 as being equivalent to 11 million Euros. Indole levels {{have been used to}} confirm the sensory evaluation of shrimp decomposition and a limit of 250 μg/kg has been used in several countries to differentiate passable shrimp from shrimp in the first stage of decomposition. No data exist on indole levels in this species and taking into account that a considerable amount of the catches are exported as fresh to Spain, it was necessary to evaluate the indole production in order to identify the usefulness of this index as an indicator of temperature abuse in this species. Biochemical, physicochemical, microbiological and sensory changes were evaluated in fresh deepwater pink shrimp stored at 2 °C and at room temperature (22 °C). Cooked deepwater pink shrimp chill-stored was studied too. The results indicated that indole was produced at levels of 167 μg/kg when raw shrimp was chill-stored for 7 days, while levels around 7400 μg/kg were produced after 32 h in raw shrimp stored at room temperature. Indole production of deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimps,</b> showed a close parallel with microbiology data, mainly with Enterobacteriaceae production. We concluded that, in the conditions studied, the indole could be considered a useful indicator in assessing the history of shrimp if high temperature is suspected or bad hygiene conditions have been applied.

For example, the requirement of a Bycatch Reduction Device on trawl nets targeting <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> was approved in 2001 and has greatly reduced levels of finfish bycatch. Fishery production has declined, particularly in recent years, and may be attributed to decreased market prices, followed by reduced fishermen participation; both of which are related to changes in the processing sector and demand for the product...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Farfantepenaeus duorarum, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} shrimp species commercially harvested along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the US. In this study we developed a mitochondrial marker suitable for population studies of the species. A 611 - 617 bp hypervariable portion of the AT-rich region of the mt genome was amplified and sequenced. The 617 bp long consensus sequence contained 15 polymorphic insertion/deletion sites and 165 polymorphic substitution sites. Kimura 2 -parameter distances ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 06 with a mean of 0. 02. Among the 104 sequences, 100 haplotypes were counted if all mutations were included. If transitions were omitted, 34 haplotypes were observed. The results indicate that the hypervariable portion of the AT-rich region may be an effective marker for revealing the genetic structure of the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> off the southeast US...|$|R
40|$|Honduras {{has many}} {{communities}} of artisanal fishermen who land various species of crustaceans and mollusks, using hands, nets, traps, and free diving from shore and from dugout canoes. It also has industrial fisheries for spiny lobster, Panulirus argus; queen conch, Strombus gigas; and mainly <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Penaeus notialis, using traps, scuba divers, and trawl nets...|$|R
