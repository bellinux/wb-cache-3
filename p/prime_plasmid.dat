In contrast, R <b>prime</b> <b>plasmids</b> harboring the entire wide host range virulence region were unable to achieve this effect. Via site-directed mutagenesis a search was performed to identify the T-DNA genes which were responsible for the observed host range extension. Inactivation of one of the onc-genes (the cyt gene) was found to abolish the capacity of the T-region to extend the host range of LBA 649. Therefore, we cloned the cyt gene into a disarmed T-region plant vector and used it in complementation studies with pTiAg 57 via the binary vector strategy. We show that the mere presence of the cyt gene from a wide host range Ti plasmid is sufficient to extend the host range of LBA 649 to certain plants. We conclude that the limited host range of LBA 649 is not caused by a lack of recognition of plants but is mainly due to the absence or inactivity of a cyt gene in the T-region of pTiAg 57...|$|R

These R primes carry different segments of an c&opine Ti plasmid, and are compatible with Ti plasmids. They were used to study genetic complementation of Ti plasmid insertion mutants, outside the T-DNA region, which affected oncogenicity. Complementation was observed in both recombination-proficient and-deficient strains. The complementation in trans indicates that certain functions essential for tumor formation outside the T-DNA region are probably expressed in the bacterium. Therefore, the authors proposed {{to make a distinction}} between virulence (Vir) functions and oncogenic (One) functions of the octopine Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A large R prime was obtained, carrying the whole Ti plasmid, except a 7 -Mdalton segment, containing the Ti plasmid replicator region. Strains harboring this plasmid induced normal tumors, showing that the replicator region of the octopine Ti plasmid is dispcnsible for tumor induction. The plant tumor crown gall is caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. After wounding and subsequent infection, tumors can be induced on most dicotyledons. A large plasmid in Agrobacterium strains, the Ti plasmid, is essential for tumor formation (Van Larebeke et al., 1974; Watson et al., 1975; Zaenen et al., 1974).

Several parameters which could effect the efficiency of plasmid transfer were assessed, including the possible presence of a restriction/modification system, and it was found that transfer was at its' most efficient when M. capsulatus was in early logarithmic growth, transfer took place over 24 hours at 37 oC, and the ratio of donor to recipient was at least 1 : 5. It was also possible to transfer the plasmids RP 4 and pULB 113 from M. capsulatus to E. coli. The initial development of a vector for analysis of promoter expression in M. capsulatus was attempted. Several plasmids were also investigated for their ability to act as mutagenesis vectors in M. capsulatus. pSUP 2021 was found to transfer into M. capsulatus and Tn 5, present on the vector, was shown to be inserted into the chromosome.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} plasmids {{representative of}} most incompatibility groups for their conferred deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) primase activity. RP 4 (IncP) {{was one of}} the few with such activity although, unlike the derepressed IncIalpha plasmids (which also specify a primase), it did not suppress the dnaG mutation. Using deletion and Tn 7 derivatives of RP 4, we located the presumed primase structural gene (pri) in the 37 - to 42 -kilobase region. Tn 7 insertions in the adjacent Tra 1 region also reduced or caused overproduction of primase. We purified the RP 4 primase to a single polypeptide of molecular weight 118, 000. It is an anisometric molecule and functions as a monomer, initiating complementary strand synthesis on phi X 174 DNA in Escherichia coli dnaG cell extracts in the presence of ribonucleotide triphosphates and rifampin. It is immunologically unrelated to either the E. coli dnaG or the IncIalpha plasmid-specified DNA primases. RP 4 pri mutants conjugated with a lower efficiency into some bacterial species, including Salmonella typhimurium. Back-transfer experiments showed that this effect was recipient specific. There was also a comparable reduction in mobilization efficiency of R 300 B by RP 4 pri into such recipients. Loss of RP 4 primase led to detectable plasmid instability. The RP 4 -specified primase therefore seems to serve two functions: the single DNA strand transferred during conjugation is primed by it in the recipient cell, and it appears to be necessary for the efficient <b>priming</b> of discontinuous <b>plasmid</b> DNA replication despite the presence of the chromosomal priming system...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific <b>plasmids</b> <b>primed</b> comparable immune responses. Both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of BT in Europe {{and the spread}} of BTV - 8 further north in the region than ever before, has emphasised the importance of vaccination against this economically important pathogen. The chemically inactivated and live attenuated BTV vaccines that are currently available do provide significant levels of protection (Savini et al., 2007). However, there are safety concerns over both vaccines, and it has not been possible to 'distinguish infected from vaccinated animals' (DIVA assays), making surveillance more difficult. A new generation of BTV vaccines is therefore required for use as part of appropriate surveillance and control strategies. 'Next generation' BTV - 8 subunit-vaccine-candidates were prepared as: individual bacterial-expressed viral-proteins; 'DNA vaccines' composed of plasmid DNA carrying BTV genes; and recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara (rMV A) also carrying BTV genes. These systems were used to explore the potential of BTV VP 2 -fragment-l, - 2 and - 3, VP 2 -complete, VP 5 and VP 7 as subunit vaccines. Different vaccination strategies were evaluated in IFNAR -/- mice: by vaccination with bacterial expressed proteins (fragmented VP 2 + VP 5 + VP 7; or complete VP 2 + VP 5 + VP 7) combined with Montanide, in a prime-boost regime -administered at a three week interval. A second vaccination strategy was based on (in situ) expression of viral proteins, by <b>priming</b> with <b>plasmid</b> DNA containing cDNA copies of BTV VP 2, VP 5 and/or VP 7 capsid-genes, followed by vaccination with recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara (rMY A) expressing the same proteins, at a three week interval. An alternative prime-boost regime was also used, vaccinating (prime and boost) with rMV A (expressing these proteins) on both occasions. The unvaccinated-control mice, as well as those vaccinated with VP 7 (alone) or with (fragmented VP 2 + VP 5 + VP 7) were not protected against a subsequent challenge with a lethal dose (lOpfu) of BTV- 8. However, 50 % of mice vaccinated with complete VP 2 + VP 5 + VP 7 were protected. All of the mice vaccinated with DNA-rMV A or rMV A-rMV A expressing VP 2; or VP 2, VP 5 and VP 7, were protected, with VP 2 -alone generating the highest level of protection. Further work will be needed to test different combinations of these BTV- subunit vaccine candidates, to validate their use and efficacy in ruminants (the natural hosts for BTV infection), and further investigate their potential for protection against heterologous serotypes. 3 IEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|When {{introduced}} in the 1990 s, immunization with DNA plasmids was considered potentially revolutionary for vaccine development, particularly for vaccines intended to induce protective CD 8 T cell responses against multiple antigens. We conducted, in 1997 − 1998, the first clinical trial in healthy humans of a DNA vaccine, a single plasmid encoding Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), as an initial step toward developing a multi-antigen malaria vaccine targeting the liver stages of the parasite. As the next step, we conducted in 2000 – 2001 a clinical trial of a five-plasmid mixture called MuStDO 5 encoding pre-erythrocytic antigens PfCSP, PfSSP 2 /TRAP, PfEXP 1, PfLSA 1 and PfLSA 3. Thirty-two, malaria-naïve, adult volunteers were enrolled sequentially into four cohorts receiving a mixture of 500 μg of each plasmid plus escalating doses (0, 20, 100 or 500 μg) of a sixth plasmid encoding human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF). Three doses of each formulation were administered intramuscularly by needle-less jet injection at 0, 4 and 8 weeks, and each cohort had controlled human malaria infection administered by five mosquito bites 18 d later. The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated, inducing moderate antigen-specific, MHC-restricted T cell interferon-γ responses but no antibodies. Although no volunteers were protected, T cell responses were boosted post malaria challenge. This trial demonstrated the MuStDO 5 DNA and hGM-CSF plasmids {{to be safe and}} modestly immunogenic for T cell responses. It also laid the foundation for <b>priming</b> with DNA <b>plasmids</b> and boosting with recombinant viruses, an approach known for nearly 15 y to enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Immunization with {{recombinant}} serotype 5 adenoviral (rAd 5) vectors or {{a combination}} of DNA <b>plasmid</b> <b>priming</b> and rAd 5 boosting is known to elicit potent immune responses. However, little data exist regarding these immunization strategies and the development of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) neutralizing antibodies. We used DNA plasmids and rAd 5 vectors encoding the HIV- 1 89. 6 P or chimeric HxB 2 /BaL envelope glycoprotein to immunize macaque monkeys. A single rAd 5 immunization elicited anti-Env antibody responses, but there was little boosting with subsequent rAd 5 immunizations. In contrast, rAd 5 boosting of DNA-primed monkeys resulted in a rapid rise in antibody titers, including the development of anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibodies. The potency and breadth of neutralization were evaluated by testing plasma against a panel of 14 clade B primary isolates. Moderate levels of plasma neutralizing activity were detected against about one-third of the viruses tested, and immunoglobulin G fractionation demonstrated that virus neutralization was antibody mediated. After a challenge with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV 89. 6 P), an anamnestic neutralizing antibody response was observed, although the breadth of the response was limited to the subset of viruses that were neutralized after the primary immunization. These data are the first detailed description of the anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibody response in nonhuman primates elicited by DNA and rAd 5 immunization. In addition to the well-established ability of DNA priming and rAd 5 boosting to elicit potent anti-HIV- 1 cellular immune responses, this immunization strategy elicits anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibodies and therefore can be used to study novel Env immunogens designed to elicit more potent neutralizing antibodies...|$|R

In our previous HIVIS- 03 trial, we used 5 injections with 2 pools of HIV-DNA at separate sites for each priming immunization. The present study explores whether HIV-DNA priming can be simplified {{by reducing the}} number of DNA injections and administration of combined versus separated plasmid pools. In this phase IIa, randomized trial, priming was performed using 5 injections of HIV-DNA, 1000 μg total dose, (3 Env and 2 Gag encoding plasmids) compared to two "simplified" regimens of 2 injections of HIV-DNA, 600 μg total dose, of Env- and Gag-encoding plasmid pools with each pool either administered separately or combined. HIV-DNA immunizations were given intradermally at weeks 0, 4, and 12. Boosting was performed intramuscularly with 108 pfu HIV-MVA at weeks 30 and 46. 129 healthy Tanzanian participants were enrolled. There were no differences in adverse events between the groups. The proportion of IFN-γ ELISpot responders to Gag and/or Env peptides after the second HIV-MVA boost did not differ significantly between the groups primed with 2 injections of combined HIV-DNA pools, 2 injections with separated pools, and 5 injections with separated pools (90 %, 97 % and 97 %).

Control dogs were vaccinated with plasmid encoding either hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBVs) or COPV L 1. Using a prophylactic immunisation protocol, a <b>priming</b> dose of <b>plasmid</b> DNA {{was followed by}} a booster dose 6 weeks later. Four weeks after boost, all dogs were challenged with infectious COPV particles. Following viral challenge, as shown previously (M. A. Stanley et al., 2001, Vaccine 19, 2783 - 2792), mucosal papillomas developed in the negative-control HBVs vaccinated dogs, but all animals in the COPV L 1 group were fully protected from disease development. In the early gene-vaccinated groups five of six in the E 1 -vaccinated dogs, two of six in E 2 -vaccinated dogs, and three of six in the E 7 -vaccinated beagles developed oral papillomas. Compared to the HBVs negative-control group the oral papillomas that did develop in the early-gene vaccinated beagles were significantly smaller, shorter in duration, and fewer in number. Taken together the disease burden was markedly reduced and this was statistically significant. In a second experiment one group of animals was vaccinated with plasmid encoding the wild-type COPV E 1 gene, and a separate group was vaccinated with plasmid encoding a synthetic codon-optimised COPV E 1 gene sequence. None of the codon-optimised E 1 -vaccinated animals developed papillomas at any challenge site. However, all animals vaccinated with wild-type E 1 had papillomas. These data suggest that immunisation by PMID with papillomavirus early genes can significantly impact upon subsequent disease development and that full protection can be achieved using improved vectors encoding codon-optimised gene sequences perhaps emphasizing the importance of antigen load in the generation of protective responses to papillomavirus proteins...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the global HIV {{epidemic}} in 1981, more than twentyfive million people have succumbed to AIDS-related diseases. The epidemic is most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa, where twentyfive million people are currently infected and more than two million died during 2006. An indication of the epidemic s severity is that every hour the virus infects between 300 and 800 people. It is clear that an effective prophylactic vaccine is desperately needed. Attempts to utilize classical vaccine strategies against HIV- 1 have proven inefficient or potentially harmful and researchers have therefore been obliged to explore novel vaccine approaches. Genetic immunization is a new way of inducing immune responses against antigens deriving from microbial pathogens or tumors. The gene encoding the antigen of interest is introduced into the body by means of an expression vector, which commonly is a recombinant bacterial plasmid or an attenuated recombinant microbe. This method of immunization has the primary benefit of inducing an immune response that mimics the response to natural infection with an intracellular pathogen. The primary strategy we use to induce high levels of broadly reactive immune responses against HIV- 1 is immunization with naked DNA encoding multiple viral antigens in combination with potent adjuvants. The immune responses that are induced against plasmid-encoded antigens can be significantly augmented by subsequently boosting with additional vaccine modalities, an immunization protocol referred to as heterologous prime boost. Specifically, we show in mice {{that it is possible to}} obtain both humoral and cellular immune responses to all plasmid-encoded HIV- 1 antigens in a multi-plasmid vaccine. The cytokine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor acted as an adjuvant. We also show that spatial separation of the vaccine components could augment the immune responses to some of the included antigens. Further, the responses induced by the multi-plasmid vaccine were efficiently boosted using Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) carrying similar, but not identical, HIV- 1 genes. The MVA boost resulted in significantly increased levels of HIV- 1 specific antibodies as well as extremely high levels of polyfunctional CD 8 + T cell responses directed against all included HIV- 1 antigens. We also show the capacity of DNA and MVA to induce long-lived vaccine-specific immunological memory. Importantly, DNA was shown capable of efficiently boosting an immune response primed almost one year earlier by the same DNA construct. Moreover, the capacity of different vaccine protocols to induce protection against a cell-based HIV- 1 challenge was demonstrated in an experimental model. Protection against challenge was obtained by immunizing with plasmids encoding HIV- 1 Gag, Env and Tat, either alone or by <b>priming</b> with the <b>plasmids</b> and subsequently boosting with the corresponding proteins. With one exception, all the vaccine constructs described here have been or are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In our initial phase I trial, the multigene/multisubtype vaccine has shown great potential to induce HIV- 1 specific cellular immune responses in humans that can be dramatically augmented and broadened by boosting with the recombinant MVA. This vaccine protocol is currently being evaluated in a phase I trial in Tanzania. Overall, the preclinical data presented in this thesis have translated well into immunogenicity in clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Anthrax is a {{zoonotic}} disease affecting most warm-blooded mammals. Primarily {{recognized as a}} disease of herbivores, it {{is caused by a}} spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. The disease has a worldwide distribution though, mostly of sporadic nature in developed countries due to effective vaccination and control measures. This feat was largely due to the introduction of the Sterne 34 F 2 live spore vaccine in the 1940 s. While proving effective in controlling anthrax, the Sterne vaccine has a number of problems which, it is hoped, can be surmounted with the advent of recombinant peptides or DNA acellular alternatives. Such vaccines would overcome the issues of handling live B. anthracis during production and avoid batch to batch variation in content and immunogenicity and should improve the duration of immunity. Most importantly, these would also permit simultaneous anti-microbial treatment and vaccination of animals; allowing the early development of immunity in treated animals. The principal virulence factors of B. anthracis are located on two plasmids pXO 1 and pXO 2. The pXO 1 encodes the toxic factors; protective antigen (PA), lethal and oedema factors (LF and EF) respectively while pXO 2 contains the encapsulation genes. The poly-?-D-glutamic acid capsule is poorly immunogenic and assists in post-infection dissemination of the organism. The capsule enables the anthrax bacilli to evade immune surveillance mechanisms and enter the circulatory system where it proliferates systemically. PA combines with LF, a zinc metalloprotease, to form lethal toxin (LT) that inactivates most mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK) and inflammasome-activating NLR 1 B leading to the impairment and death of susceptible macrophages. Oedema toxin (ET), formed by the binding of PA to EF a calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase, disrupts fluid homeostasis across the host cell membranes. The antigens PA, BclA (Bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis) and FIS (formaldehyde inactivated spores), alone or in combination are known for their protective efficacy from previous studies in laboratory rodents. However, it remains to be elucidated if these vaccines or their combinations will elicit a protective immune response in goats against anthrax infections. In this study, these antigens in addition to various adjuvants were administered to goats in combinations. Also, we assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of plasmid DNA vaccine encoding immunodominant domains of PA, LF and BclA using a heterologous DNA prime/protein boost approach. The aims were to assess the immunogenicity of these acellular vaccine candidates in goats and evaluate the protective capacity of the immune response in an in vivo A/J mouse passive protection model. Also, the immune response following simultaneous antibiotic treatment and immunization with either acellular or live spore vaccines were studied in goats. Attempts were made to compare the resulting immunity following booster vaccinations with the acellular or Sterne live spore vaccines. Our findings indicated that the addition of FIS to recombinant PA and BclA vaccine candidates generated superior humoral immune responses compared to the recombinant peptides alone. Also, sera from goats vaccinated with the multi-component vaccine (rPA, rBclA and FIS) protected 73 % while the rPA+rBclA vaccinates sera protected 68 % of A/J mice against Sterne 34 F 2 spores in the passive protection test. Sera from goats <b>primed</b> with the <b>plasmid</b> DNA vaccine and boosted with FIS failed to protect any of the A/J mice in the challenge studies. However, caprine sera obtained following plasmid DNA vaccination and rPA and rBclA boosting protected just over 40 % of challenged mice. Importantly, our results showed that the simultaneous administration of acellular vaccine candidates with antibiotics did not negate the development of crucial anti-toxin and anti-spore antibodies in goats. The immune responses from the latter did not differ from that induced in goats treated with acellular or Sterne live spore vaccines alone. The simultaneous administration of penicillin G with Sterne live spore vaccination, while not fully blocking the development of antibody titres, did obviate the production of antibodies in 60 % of treated animals. In summary, these studies demonstrate the potential of utilizing a non-living vaccine candidate in the prevention and treatment of anthrax infections in a ruminant model.

40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and major cause of economic losses in dairy farms. Bovine mastitis caused by strains of S. aureus is a major economically important disease affecting the dairy industry worldwide. S. aureus {{is one of the}} most common udder pathogens that cause either clinical or sub-clinical mammary gland infections. Different treatment regimes have failed to cure S. aureus intramammary infections. Most mastitis vaccination strategies have focused on the enhancement of systemic humoral immunity rather than strengthening local intramammary immunity. Vaccines aimed at enhancing intramammary immunity of dairy cows against S. aureus mastitis have had limited success. Commercially available vaccines show various degrees of success and work in research laboratories with experimental vaccines suggest that in part, the failure of these vaccines lies in the limited antigenic repertoire contained in the vaccine formulations. Moreover, not only does variation in the antigenic composition but also presence of capsular polysaccharide in most pathogenic strains and decreased activity of immune effectors in milk affect the success of vaccines. In addition to these, the ability of S. aureus to attach and internalize into mammary epithelial cells, enables bacteria to escape from the effect of immunity and antibiotics by being hidden in the intracellular niche and thereby causing chronic recurrent intramammary infection. S. aureus also has the ability to become electron-transport-defective and to form slow-growing small colonies that are non haemolytic and less virulent. These small colony variants might hide from the immune surveillance in the intracellular area and revert to the parental strain causing chronic recurrent infections. If immunization targets antigenic molecules that are conserved throughout all pathogenic strains, even the small colony variants can be controlled since the immune system will clear the parental strain which causes lethal infection. Thus, immunization trials should focus on conserved immunogenic antigen molecules among pathogenic strains formulated with an adjuvant and delivered by a route of immunization to induce maximum stimulation of the immune system. Moreover, immunization should focus on inducing Th 1 responses, which is protective against S. aureus mastitis. It has been reported that proteins with glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity might be used as such antigens to induce protection against parasitic and microbial infections. Previous study in our laboratory on mastitis-causing streptococci indicates that GapC proteins of S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae have potential as vaccine antigens to protect dairy cows against mastitis caused by environmental streptococci. Two conserved cell wall associated proteins with iii glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity, GapB and GapC have been identified from S. aureus isolates from bovine intramammary infections. The overall goal of this study was to improve our understanding on intramammary immunity using the GapC and GapB proteins of S. aureus as model antigens for mastitis and to determine the regulation of expression of gapB and gapC genes and their roles in the pathogenesis of bovine S. aureus mastitis. We hypothesized that strengthening local intramammary immunity using GapB and GapC proteins of S. aureus as antigens will protect against bovine S. aureus mastitis. To test this hypothesis we took the approach of using the gapB and gapC genes and constructed plasmids encoding GapB, GapC and GapB::GapC (GapC/B) chimeric proteins. We set six objectives to test our hypothesis using these proteins to enhance the intramammary immunity. In aim 1 we constructed plasmids encoding the GapB, GapC proteins and also constructed a chimeric gene encoding the GapC and GapB proteins as a single entity (GapC/B chimera) as the basis for a multivalent vaccine. In this objective the humoral and cellular immune responses to GapC/B were compared to the responses to the individual proteins alone or in combination in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Our results showed that the GapC/B protein elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses as judged by the levels of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IL- 4 and IFN-ã secretion and lymphocyte proliferation. These results strongly suggest the potential of this chimeric protein as a target for vaccine production to control mastitis caused by S. aureus. In aim 2 we continued our studies on GapC/B by testing the effects of DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding the individual gapB and gapC genes as well as the gapC/B protein gene with or without a boost with the recombinant proteins. The results showed that DNA vaccination alone was unable to elicit a significant humoral response and barely able to elicit a detectable cell-mediated response to the recombinant antigens but subsequent immunization with the proteins elicited an excellent response. In addition, we found that DNA vaccination using a plasmid encoding the GapC/B chimera followed by a boost with the same protein, although successful, is less effective than <b>priming</b> with <b>plasmids</b> encoding GapB or GapC followed by a boost with the individual antigens. In aim 3 we optimized immune responses in cows by comparing route of vaccination (subcutaneous versus intradermal), site of vaccination (locally at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node versus distantly at area drained by parotid lymph node. Our results showed that both subcutaneous and intradermal immunizations with the GapC/B protein at the area drained by the supramammary and parotid lymph nodes resulted in significantly increased serum and milk titers of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, iv and IgA in all vaccinated groups as compared to placebo. The anti-GapC/B IgG 1 serum and milk titers were significantly higher in all vaccinated group as compared to the placebo group. These results indicated that vaccination at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node resulted in better immune responses. In aim 4 we tested different formulations of the GapC/B antigen with adjuvants such as PCPP, CpG, PCPP + CpG and VSA- 3. We found that the VSA- 3 formulation induced the best immune responses in cows. In this objective we also monitored immune responses longitudinally over one lactation cycle to determine the duration of immune responses by measuring IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgA on monthly blood and milk samples. We found that the duration of immune responses was about four months. In aim 5 we tested the role of GapC in the virulence of S. aureus mastitis using the S. aureus wild type strain RN 6390 and its isogenic GapC mutant strain H 330. Our results from both in vitro adhesion and invasion assays on MAC- T cells and in vivo infection of ovine mammary glands showed that GapC is an important virulence factor in S. aureus mastitis. In aim 6 we examined the role of sar and agr loci on the expression of gapC and gapB genes by qRT- PCR using S. aureus RN 6390 and its isogenic mutants defective in agrA, sarA and sar/agr (double mutant) at exponential and stationary phases of growth. Our results showed that both gapB and gapC expression were down regulated in the mutant strains, indicating that the expression of the gapB and gapC genes is controlled by the universal virulence gene regulators, agr and sar. We also checked the role of environmental factors such as pH, growth media, and oxygen tension on the expression of gapB and gapC using q-RT-PCR. Our results showed that the expression of gapB and gapC genes in different strains of S. aureus was not consistent under the above-mentioned environmental conditions...|$|R
