40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{classical}} Bayesian posterior arises naturally as the unique solution of different optimization problems, without the necessity of interpreting data as conditional probabilities and then using Bayesâ€™ Theorem. Here it is shown that the Bayesian posterior is also the unique minimax optimizer of the loss of self-information in combining the prior and the likelihood distributions, and is the unique <b>proportional</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the same distributions. These results, direct corollaries of recent results about conflations of probability distributions, further reinforce the use of Bayesian posteriors, and may help partially reconcile some of the differences between classical and Bayesian statistics...|$|E
40|$|The master's thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} related to the consolidation of financial statements of the group ZAPA beton. The thesis contains basic theoretical ways out relating to the consolidated financial statements. There are mentioned important terms, there are described consolidation methods and methods for their calculation. These theoretical informations were used for work out a practical part, which includes proposing <b>proportional</b> method of <b>consolidation</b> instead of the full a consolidation method for subsidiary ZAPA UNISTAV, s. r. o. Finally in the financial analysis, there are evaluated the effects of changes in methods on the financial statements of the consolidation group...|$|R
40|$|Series of {{laboratory}} testing {{on the investigation}} of soil liquefaction using cyclic triaxial test had been carried out by researchers around the world {{but many of the}} results are contradictory. Thus, it is important to first determine the condition in which the clean sand is most susceptible to liquefaction, then only the liquefaction susceptibility of sand matrix soils could be compared and discussed under this specific condition. This paper presents the undrained behaviour of Johor sand and sand mixed with fines (kaolin) from cyclic triaxial tests. Stress controlled triaxial test apparatus was used to shear the isotropically consolidated soil samples under undrained two-way cyclic loading until the initiation of liquefaction. The liquefaction was defined based on: (i) excess pore pressure was equal to effective confining pressure or (ii) double amplitude strain of 5 % was reached, whichever was achieved first. The results of two-way cyclic triaxial tests on clean sand showed that besides the cyclic stress ratio, the liquefaction resistance of the sand under undrained loading was <b>proportional</b> to effective <b>consolidation</b> pressure and density index. The Johor sand was more liquefiable at its loose state and under low effective consolidation pressure, when subjected to earthquake loading...|$|R
40|$|As {{liquefaction}} due to earthquake hazards {{may occur}} on both clean sand and soil comprising of sand with fines, {{the current research}} trend is more focusing on determining the boundary limits of liquefaction susceptibility of sand matrix soils.

It is thus important to first determine the condition in which the clean sand is most susceptible to liquefaction, only then the liquefaction susceptibility of sand matrix soils could be compared and discussed under this specific condition.

40|$|Access and {{aggregation}} networks account nowadays for a {{large share}} of the consumed energy in communication networks, and actions to ameliorate their energy cost are under investigation by the research community. In this work, we present a study of the possible savings that could be achieved if such technologies were in place. We take advantage of large datasets of measurements collected from the network of FASTWEB, a national-wide Internet Service Provider in Italy. We first perform a detailed characterization of the energy consumption of Points of Presence (PoPs) investigating on how factors such as external temperature, cooling technology and traffic load influence the consumed energy. Our mea- surements precisely quantify how the power consumption in today networks is practically independent from the traffic volume, while it is correlated only with the external temper- ature. We then narrow down our analysis to consider the traffic generated by each house- hold. More specifically, by observing about 10, 000 ADSL customers, we characterize the typical traffic patterns generated by users who access the Internet. Using the available real data, we thus investigate if the energy consumption can be sig- nificantly reduced by applying simple energy-efficient policies that are currently under studies. We investigate energy-to-traffic <b>proportional</b> and resource <b>consolidation</b> technol- ogies for the PoP, while sleep modes policies are considered at the ADSL lines. All these energy-efficient policies, even if they are not yet available, are currently being widely investigated by both manufacturers and researchers. At the PoP level, our dataset shows that {{it would be possible to}} save up to 50 % of energy, and that even simple mechanisms would easily allow to save 30 % of energy. Considering the ADSL lines, it results that sleep mode policies can be effectively implemented, reducing the energy consumption of ADSL modems with little or marginal impact on the Quality of Service offered to users. We make available all datasets used in this paper to allow other researchers to benchmark their pro- posals considering actual traffic trace...|$|R
