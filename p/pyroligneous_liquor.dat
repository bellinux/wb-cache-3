The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{destructive}} distillation of 20 Industrial Forest Plantation Timber Species {{was carried out}} by using a retort equipped with electrical heating system. This retort was also connected to three condensors and two flask to catch and collect the distillate or condensed gas. The retort capacity was about 4 kg of wood. Treatment conditions given in these experiment were maximum heating temperature of 500 °C and 5 hours distillation time. The product (charcoal, tar, <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor)</b> of the {{destructive distillation}} of wood showed a wide variation in yield or composition depending on the wood species, age and growth location. This experimental condition produces charcoal yield varying from 21, 38 - 38, 00 %, tar from 4. 99 - 13. 78 % and <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor</b> from 44. 91 - 157. 17 %. <b>Pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor</b> product can be used as disinfectant, weed killer and deodorant. Tar product has a good prospect for wood preservative subtance and medicinal. The destructive distillation of wood under these experimental conditions produced brittle and light charcoal. On the contrarary, hard charcoal could be produced from slower pyrolisis process in a commercial scale. Proximate analyses of charcoal obtained from these experiments revealed that the quality IS suitable for both as raw material for commercial activated carbon and fuel. Calorific values of wood ranged from 4285 to 4994 kcal/kg and charcoal from 6746 to 7748 kcal/kg. Based on these calorific values, wood and charcoal of the 20 wood species observed are excellent material to be used as fuel...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} degradation of wood products obtained by destructive distillation {{in this experiment}} are charcoal, <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor,</b> wood tar and fuel gas. <b>Pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor</b> contains mainly water, acetic acid and methanol. Wood tar is very complicated phenolic compound and contains creosote oil and pitch. The results of destructive distillation of 45 wood species from East Kalimantan, lrian and Maluku vary widely. Charcoal yield ranged from 19. 81 to 41. 24 percent, pyroligneous liqour from 40. 29 to 66. 12 percent and the yield tar from 5. 42 to 20. 60 percent. Chemical composition of the distillates indicated that acetic acid content ranged from 1. 19 to 9. 53 percent, methanol ranged from 0. 22 to 3. 75 percent, phenol ranged from 0. 10 to 1. 62 percent and pitch ranged from 2. 06 to 11. 53 percent. The result of proximate analysis of charcoal indicated that moisture content ranged from 1. 12 to 6. 85 percent, vovalite matter from 11. 29 to 29. 20 percent and ash ranged from 0. 23 to 7. 11 percent...|$|E
50|$|The tars and <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquors</b> {{can also}} seriously {{contaminate}} streams and affect drinking water supplies for humans and animals. Fish {{may also be}} adversely affected. Liquid effluents and waste water from medium and large scale charcoal operations should be trapped in large settling ponds and allowed to evaporate so that this water does not pass into the local drainage system and contaminate streams. Fortunately kilns and pits, as distinct from retorts and other sophisticated systems, do not normally produce liquid effluent - the by-products are mostly dispersed into the air as vapours. Precautions against airborne {{contamination of the environment}} are of greater importance in this case.|$|R

The analysis of chemical propertis comprises of {{the determination of}} cellulose, holocellulose, lignin, pentosan, moisture content, ash content, silica content, solubility in cold water, hot water, sodium hydroxide 1 percent and ethanol-benzene (1 : 2). The analysis of charcoal property comprises of charcoal, tar, <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor,</b> calorific value, volatile matter and fixed carbon. The result showed that cellulose content 48. 38 % - 50. 26 %; holocellulose 59. 68 % - 60. 17 %; lignin 31. 33 % - 33. 49 %; pentosan 15. 98 % - 16. 43 %; moisture content 7. 34 - 9. 98 %; ash 0. 64 - 0. 71 %; silica 0. 57 % - 0. 60 %. Solubility in cold water 2. 39 % - 4. 48 %; in hot water 3. 33 % - 5. 93 %; in alcohol-benzene (1 : 2) 2. 35 % - 2. 37 % and in one percent sodium hydroxide 18. 87 % - 20. 72 %. Based on chemical analysis, especially the cellulose and pentosan content, rubberwood is suitable as raw material forpulp and paper, rayon andfiberwood.

40|$|The {{story of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years BC. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has been always considered a “poor” component: {{it is not a}} “food”, it doesn’t have high nutritional values, and it is produced by transformation of other more nutritive rich fermented foods. Vinegar is a condiment, but also a preservative and, in some countries, a healthy drink. It can be made by a two step fermentation of yeasts followed by acetic acid bacteria from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source: apples, pears, grapes, honey, syrups, cereals, hydrolysed starches, beer, and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar. Since vinegars is, with few exceptions, an inexpensive commodity, its production requires a low-cost raw material, such as sub-standard fruits, seasonal agricultural surpluses, various food processing by-products and fruit waste. However there are vinegars, so called spirit vinegars, obtained directly by acetic oxidation of alcohol obtained from distillation of fermented mashes or, in some countries, petrolchemical ethanol. Some western by-products of wood carbonization obtained by distillation of <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>liquor</b> collected during wood pyrolisis, are called “vinegar” and they are used as agricultural material, animal health product, cosmetic ingredients and folk drug in Japan and Est-Asia (Mu et al., 2003; Mu et al., 2006). These distilled solutions have not be considered as vinegar because no fermentative process occurs in their production. Other specialty vinegars are grouped as herbal or fruit vinegars. In this cases the name “X vinegar” doesn’t indicate the raw materials used in vinegar fermentation but the flavours added to obtain specific taste and characteristic sensorial features. Herbal vinegars consist of wine vinegars or white distilled vinegars, which may be seasoned with garlic, basil, tarragon, cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg. Fruit-flavoured vinegars are wine and white vinegars sweetened with fruit or fruit juice to produce a characteristic sweet-sour taste. Traditional vinegars are very expensive vinegar produced from regional foods according to well-established customs: balsamic vinegar of Modena from Italy; Sherry vinegar from Spain; Champagne vinegar from France etc. According to international definition of vinegar, in this book we considered only vinegar derived from a two stage fermentation process. However with many of the vinegars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, knowledge of the processes involved is poor and a comprehensive view of all different kinds of vinegars is impossible. Therefore {{it is likely that the}} worldspread vinegars give a very greater picture. Economy, technology and law about vinegar were described in this chapter...|$|E
