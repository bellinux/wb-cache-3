TVX/Kinross/High River operated the New Britannia Mine, which closed in January 2005, and HudBay Minerals, which operated 12 area mines. They were/are Lalor Mine, Chisel Lake, Stall Lake, Osborne Lake, Dickstone, Anderson Lake, Ghost Lake, Lost Lake, Spruce <b>Point,</b> <b>Rod</b> Mine, Photo Lake, and Chisel North.|$|E

The final test of his Advanced Survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days. Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry, but are otherwise completely on their own. They are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable. On test day, each student walks through the Ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet, though reasonably close to the pickup <b>point.</b> <b>Rod,</b> acting on his older sister's advice, takes hunting knives and basic survival gear rather than high-tech weaponry, {{on the grounds that the}} latter could make him over-confident. The last advice the students receive is to [...] "watch out for stobor." ...|$|E
50|$|His {{sewing machine}} used the chain stitch method, {{in which the}} machine uses a single thread to make simple {{stitches}} in the fabric. A stitching awl would pierce the material and a forked <b>point</b> <b>rod</b> would carry the thread through the hole {{where it would be}} hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch. Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the London Science Museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest arrangement {{consists of}} two turnouts and a fixed diamond crossing. Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the curve radius is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km/h. This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space. Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical <b>point</b> <b>rodding</b> of a single signal box.|$|R

50|$|The {{challenge}} {{of such a}} diminutive scale meant that these pieces would have been extremely difficult to securely hold in place (brace) during their shaping and cutting. They were likely positioned on a bench between two posts, {{so they could be}} turned 360 degrees. The major figures, usually saints, were typically carved from single wood blocks of wood. Once fully composed, all components were pinned and fastened with glue onto prefixed niches within the overall object. A notably delicate example of this layering technique is in the Prayer bead (AGO 29365) in the Art Gallery of Ontario, where minuscule, individually carved, <b>pointed</b> <b>rods</b> suggesting rays of light were added to the vaulted ceiling via tiny drilled holes.|$|R

A guest to the island is presented with a fresh coconut on arrival indicating that he is welcome to enjoy his stay in Niue.|$|R
50|$|The points {{failure was}} caused by the {{extremely}} cold weather that day freezing the point mechanisms. When the signalman had accepted the fish train from the previous signalbox to the North, he needed to swing the facing points (that allowed entry into the Up Platform Loop from the Up line) from reverse to normal. When he pushed the lever back into the frame he was able to engage the point lock and thus clear the signal. Unbeknown to him, the <b>point</b> <b>rods</b> had actually bent due to the mechanisms freezing up, which allowed him to place the point lever in the normal position, but actually left the points in reverse. This accident is one of the very rare occasions where mechanical interlocking has failed to work correctly.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of a}} £200m {{regeneration}} {{scheme to}} boost train capacity in Cardiff and the surrounding areas, Barry now has a third platform (Platform 3) which is now only used by down or sometimes up trains to & from Barry Island. [...] Up trains can and still do use the Barry station up platform (1) generally but as the new platform line is now bi-directional and signalled as such, it is also sometimes used for up passenger trains which can start from here if a 'catch-up' in the timetable is required, thereby cutting out a reversal at Barry Island. The laying of the bi-directional platform line had to be performed while essential signal wires and <b>point</b> <b>rodding</b> lying 1.75m from the platform wall, was still in place. The 'new' platform support blockwork was thus constructed so that its finished edge now lies 2.75m from the former obsolete platform edge. During the months of construction, Barry signal box {{was taken out of}} use making the signal pull-wires and <b>point</b> <b>rodding</b> redundant and by week ending 28 March 2014, the ’box was demolished. Having removed the latter components, the void between old and new platform edges was backfilled, tarmacked over and new coping platform stones laid. Prior to 1964, this platform was that of platform, 4, platform 1 previously being the Bay platform where trains to Pontypridd via Wenvoe or sometimes Cardiff started. That area is now a Park & Ride facility. Platform 1 serves all up trains to Cardiff and beyond from either Barry Island or Bridgend.Platform 2 now serves only trains to Bridgend as the line to Barry Island from the junction south of platform 2 was curtailed during the remodelling project and acts as a safety overrun with a buffer stop 100m from the down facing points.|$|R

40|$|Cu-Si nanocomposites {{formed by}} an {{immersion}} displacement deposition of Cu into porous silicon (PS) matrix have been experimentally studied. SEM and AES {{were used to}} investigate the structure and elemental composition of Cu-Si samples. The top part of the Cu-PS samples is shown to demonstrate the following structure: large faceted Cu grains at the top, a porous fine-grained copper film underneath the large grains, and the copper <b>pointed</b> <b>rods</b> extended from the surface into the PS layer. The top part of the silicon skeleton of the PS layer is converted into the copper by the etching followed by Cu displacement deposition. The porosity of the porous layer and displacement deposition times are found to form Cu-Si nanocomposites of various structures and various Cu-Si contents because of various extent of the silicon skeleton transformation into copper. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
