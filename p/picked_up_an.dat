The film was pushed {{out from a}} November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio's tight end-of-year release schedule. Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate.

5|$|As a British {{passport}} holder born outside the United Kingdom, FIFA regulations {{at the time}} allowed him to select which of the Home Nations {{he would like to}} represent, which led to interest from the non-English Home Nations. In September 1999, he rejected a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark Hughes and coach Eric Harrison. However, he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> ankle injury in the lead-up to the game and missed out on the match-day squad.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Films <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{option for}} a fourth Superman/Reeve film, with Reeve reprising the role due to his {{interest}} in the film's topic regarding nuclear weapons. However, Cannon decided to cut the budget of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace from $35 million to $15 million, with poor special effects and heavy re-editing, which contributed to the film's poor reception. Warner Bros. decided to give the series a break following the negative reception of the last two Superman films.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{suffered}} a suspected broken metatarsal in September 2007, {{and made his}} return for Wigan in a 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in November. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> ankle injury during Wigan's 5–3 victory against Blackburn in December 2007. On 14 April 2008, Heskey scored a 90th minute equalising goal against Chelsea, which damaged their hopes of winning the Premier League. He went on to score Wigan's equaliser against Tottenham in the following match {{to give them a}} 1–1 draw, which proved to be his last goal of 2007–08, which he finished with 4 goals in 30 appearances.|$|E

5|$|Southall {{was bought}} by Everton manager Howard Kendall for £150,000 {{in the summer of}} 1981. To win a first team place he had to compete with Jim McDonagh (a Gordon Lee signing who would soon leave the club), Jim Arnold (also a new signing), and Martin Hodge (who was injured {{throughout}} his time at Everton). He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Ipswich Town in October, after Arnold <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury. He returned to the first team in December, and he kept a clean sheet against Aston Villa and remained an ever-present {{throughout the rest of the}} 1981–82 season.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the results have been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo scored {{his first}} goal for Leeds against Millwall {{on his return}} to the {{starting}} lineup after missing the previous game against Norwich City having <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> illness on international duty. His international call-ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed. Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town, Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training. He had not recovered from injury {{to be able to have}} a part in the squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering. Instead, the Australia international returned to the Leeds starting line up against Brentford.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{started the}} 2009–10 season healthy {{for the first}} time since 2007 and quickly made an impact. Playing {{alongside}} Alex Song and Cesc Fàbregas, he became part of the dynamic three-man midfield partnership. On 22 August 2009, he scored a double in a 4–1 win over Portsmouth. The following month, Diaby assisted on a goal in the team's 3–2 comeback win over Belgian club Standard Liège in the Champions League. After alternating between the bench and starting lineup for the rest of September, in November, Diaby returned to the first eleven and responding by scoring the game-winning goal in a 3–1 win over Birmingham City. Three weeks later, in the Champions League, he netted another goal in a group stage win over Dutch club AZ. On 7 November, Diaby <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury in a 4–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. The injury resulted in the player missing France's World Cup playoff tie with the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{ankle injury}} seven minutes into a 2–1 home defeat to Salisbury City on 9 March 2010, {{and made his}} return in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth on 27 March. He played in both legs of York's {{play-off}} semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate, and scored the goal in the 1–0 away win in the second leg with a clipped shot from threeyards after goalkeeper Mark Tyler parried Rankine's free kick. Following the match, {{he was hit by}} a coin with the York squad being forced to leave the ground through the back of a stand after having missiles thrown at them by a section of Luton fans. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 74 minutes, as York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished the season with 39 appearances and 3 goals for York.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September, Carrick scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2009–10 season with the decisive goal against German champions Wolfsburg in a 2–1 Champions League win at home. Two months later, he scored his first league goal of the season, scoring the second of a 3–0 home win over Everton. Due to a {{defensive}} crisis during December, Carrick had to fill in at centre-back since Gary Neville, himself being played out of position, <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury against West Ham United in a 4–0 away win. Carrick had never previously played in defence during his career but manager Sir Alex Ferguson was very pleased with his contribution. On 8 December, he played in defence again by playing in a three-man defence alongside central-midfielder Darren Fletcher and regular left-back Patrice Evra in a 3–1 away win against Wolfsburg in the Champions League. His third goal of the season came on 30 December in a 5–0 home league win over Wigan Athletic in what was United's last game of the decade.|$|E

5|$|Rankine {{missed an}} 87th-minute penalty for York away to Kettering, with Reed scoring the team's goal in a 1–1 draw. Jonathan Smith {{scored in the}} first half for York at home to league-leaders Crawley, who {{equalised}} in the second half, with the match finishing a 1–1 draw. Racchi was released from his contract with immediate effect after requesting a transfer, having failed to establish himself in the team. York beat Newport 2–1 at home, with Rankine opening the scoring before assisting Reed for the second goal. McGurk <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> ankle ligament injury in this match, which ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season. York suffered their first defeat at home since December 2010 after losing 2–1 to Tamworth, in which Constantine scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute. Having not made any appearances for the club, Chippendale was recalled by Huddersfield. Reed scored the only goal to give York a 1–0 victory at home to Luton. Young was recalled from his loan at Altrincham after Parslow suffered a head injury during the match against Luton.|$|E
5|$|Till was loaned {{out again}} on 13 January 2006, joining League Two club Boston United. He made his debut {{a day later}} in a 1–0 victory at Chester City and his only goal came in a 3–1 victory over Bury on 21 January 2006. On 31 January 2006, the loan was {{extended}} {{until the end of}} the 2005–06 season and he finished his spell at the club with 16 appearances and one goal. Till joined League One club Leyton Orient on a one-month loan on 6 October 2006. His debut came the following day, making the starting line-up in a 0–0 draw with Chesterfield and he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury on his final appearance, a 3–1 defeat to Bristol City in the Football League Trophy on 1 November 2006. Orient opted not to extend Till's loan and his period at the club ended on 4 November 2006 with five appearances to his name.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheduled}} title {{match between}} the two teams at Armageddon was changed at the event to a four-way ladder match, also involving The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) and MNM. In the match London and Kendrick were able to retrieve the belts to retain their championship. When a regular tag team rematch was signed with Regal and Taylor two weeks later, London and Kendrick were successful in defeating them. On the February 16 episode of SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled another ladder match between the teams of London and Kendrick, Regal and Taylor, MNM, and The Hardys for the WWE Tag Team Championship at February's pay-per-view event No Way Out, but WWE's official website announced the match had changed to pit The Hardys and Chris Benoit against MNM and MVP, while London and Kendrick faced rookie team Deuce 'n Domino (Deuce and Domino) in a separate match; they were booked to successfully retain the titles against Deuce 'n Domino. Their almost year-long reign {{came to an end}} when they were defeated by Deuce 'n Domino for the title on the April 20, 2007 episode of SmackDown! in Milan, Italy. London <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury, resulting in Kendrick challenging Deuce 'n Domino in singles matches, losing to Deuce, but defeating Domino. London returned on the May 11 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Domino in a singles match. London and Kendrick then unsuccessfully attempted to regain the Tag Team Championship, losing to Deuce 'n Domino in a triple threat match also involving Regal and Taylor, and in a standard tag team match two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|Banks faced {{competition}} from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old Scotland international John Anderson and 25-year-old Dave MacLaren. He started the 1959–60 {{season as the}} reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren. He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September. The match finished 1–1, with Jackie Mudie's strike cancelling out Ken Leek's opener. Banks retained his place for the 2–0 loss to Newcastle United at St James' Park three days later. With McLaren fit again, Banks {{was sent back to}} the reserves but, after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games, he was recalled and became the first-choice goalkeeper {{for the remainder of the}} season. The defensive record did not improve at first, with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, but he improved in each match and the Foxes settled for a comfortable 12th-place finish. In training, he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses, such as coming for crosses. He put in extra hours during training and came up with practice sessions to improve his skills – this was largely unique in an era where there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches. In the summer, both Anderson and MacLaren departed, leaving Banks as the club's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers' loan was {{extended}} until January 2010, and after Sangaré <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury, Mansfield defender Luke Graham joined on a one-month loan. York beat League Two team Crewe Alexandra 3–2 in the FA Cup first round, with goals from Brodie and Pacquette. Nelthorpe was loaned to fellow Conference Premier club Barrow until January 2010, having struggled to establish {{himself in the}} team. Kevin Gall, a striker released by Darlington, was signed ahead of the match against Chester City, which York won 3–2 after Brodie scored a hat-trick. Former Grays Athletic winger Tyrone Berry was signed on non-contract terms, having impressed on trial. Rankine scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Ebbsfleet. He followed this up with the winning goal after scoring a header in a 1–0 away victory over AFC Wimbledon. Lawless scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory at home to Gateshead, with a low shot from Gash's headed assist. Cambridge were beaten 2–1 away {{in the second round}} of the FA Cup; Rankine and Brodie scored in the first half, which meant York reached the third round for the first time since 2001–02. Foyle and Brodie respectively were named as the Conference Premier Manager and Player of the Month for November 2009.|$|E
