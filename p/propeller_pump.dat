40|$|Because of {{undesirable}} effects of cavitation, {{the design of}} a cavitation free structure is an important problem in the field of Hydraulic Engineering. The surface of an ordinary hydraulic structure has roughness, scattered randomly or isolated. Only few investigations have been done on the effects of surface roughness on cavitation. Therefore, “the effects of randomly distributed surface roughness on cavitation” is investigated in this paper. For the experimental investigation of the problem, a circulating type 6 inch water tunnel is designed and constructed at the Hydraulic Laboratory of Civil Engineering Department, the Pennsylvania State University, U. S. A. The test section of the tunnel has a cylindrical cross section with an inside diameter of 6 inches and a length of 24 inches. An axial flow <b>propeller</b> <b>pump</b> (9 inches in diameter), driven by a two speed motor, is installed for the circulation of water. The velocities in the test section corresponding to high and low motor speed are 43. 52 and 32. 42 feet per second. The static pressure in the test section is controlled by the pressure control system and a vacuum pump. The range of the static pressure is from 2 psia to 85 psia. The models employed in the test are three families of 3 / 4 inch diameter stainless steel noses having 1. 5 caliver ogive, hemispherical and blunt profiles. Each family consists of four noses having different surface roughness. The first one is polished with hand, the second is roughened with sand blasting and the third and forth are roughened with steel shot. The surface roughness ranges from 2. 8 to 580 p in rms. The test is conducted in the 6 inch water tunnel, and consists of finding the desinent cavitation number and the incipient cavitation number under different conditions. The air content of water is measured for each test run using a Van Slyke equipment. The test results show that, in general, the cavitation number for the onset condition increases significantly as the surface roughness increases. In addition, it is seen from the results that there is a close correlation between the air content of water and the onset of cavitation. In general, the cavitation number for the onset condition increases as the air content of water increases...|$|E

50|$|Reef ready tanks obtain {{at least}} {{a portion of the}} {{required}} water motion from the pump that returns water from the sump. This flow usually is augmented by other strategies. A popular strategy is placement within the display tank of multiple powerheads. Powerheads are simply small submersible water pumps that produce a laminar or narrow, unidirectional water stream. If the presence of the powerhead in the tank does not fit with the aesthetics of the display, small holes may be drilled in an overflow of a tank and the bulk of the powerhead can be hidden, leaving only the small funnel spout visible in the tank. The pumps may be alternately switched on and off using a wave timer and aimed at one another or at the aquarium glass to create turbulent flow in the tank. Drawbacks to the use of these powerheads include their capacity to clutter the display tank, propensity for excess heat production, and the laminar quality of water flow often produced. Another method is the closed loop in which water is pulled from the main tank into a pump which returns the water back into the aquarium via one or more returns to create water turbulence. Newer submersible <b>propeller</b> <b>pumps</b> are gaining popularity and are able to generate large volumes of turbulent water flow without the intensely directed laminar force of a power head. <b>Propeller</b> <b>pumps</b> are more energy-efficient than powerheads, but require a higher initial investment.|$|R

40|$|Development of new {{renewable}} technologies {{is an important}} driver in the scientific community. As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase and the dependence on a finite amount of fossil fuel remains, the need for sustainable forms of energy is ever growing. Research {{in the field of}} renewable biofuels has pointed researchers toward the naturally occurring, robust, lipid- producing microorganism; microalgae. Its ability to sequester carbon and yield high lipid production has made it very attractive to renewable research. It has the potential to produce up to 10 times the oil, per acre, than competing biofuel feedstocks. However, an energy efficient method of harvesting algal biomass has yet to be utilized. The methods currently used employ large energy inputs, reducing overall efficiency of the harvest. The use of cavitation as destructive phenomenon has been largely studied in the past as something to avoid. Problems encountered on boat <b>propellers,</b> <b>pump</b> impellers, and turbines are designed to stay within certain operating parameters as to avoid cavitation, which would lead to failure of the equipment. It has more recently gained attention as a useable force, however a more thorough investigation of cavitational parameters is required in order to aid engineers and designers to understand the extent of its usefulness. The work implements a hydrodynamic cavitation system testing different operating parameters for evaluation of efficiency. Orifice plates were tested at varying cavitation numbers, power inputs, and geometric parameters in a controlled system. The Weissler reaction was employed to verify the intensity of the cavitating flow and the influence of tested parameters.

50|$|The {{molecular}} propellers {{designed in}} the group of Prof. Petr Král from the University of Illinois at Chicago have their blades formed by planar aromatic molecules and the shaft is a carbon nanotube. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these propellers can serve as efficient pumps in the bulk and at the surfaces of liquids. Their pumping efficiency depends on the chemistry of the interface between the blades and the liquid. For example, if the blades are hydrophobic, water molecules do not bind to them, and the <b>propellers</b> can <b>pump</b> them well. If the blades are hydrophilic, water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the atoms in the polar blades. This can largely block the flow of other water molecules around the blades and significantly slow down their pumping.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program entitled URPE (Uranium Recovery Performance and Economics) {{has been developed}} to simulate the engineering performance and provide an economic analysis O of a plant recovering uranium from seawater. The conceptual system design used as the focal point for the more general AM analysis consists ofa floating oil-rig type platform, Asinlge-point moored in an open ocean current, using either high volume, low head, <b>propeller</b> <b>pumps</b> or the velocity head 4 M of the ambient ocean current to force seawater through a mass transfer medium (hydrous titanium oxide (HTO) coated onto particle beds or stacked tubes), as in most process designs previously suggested for this service. Uranium is recovered Sfrom the seawater by an adsorption process, and later eluted. from the adsorber by an ammonium carbonate solution. A multi-product co-generating plant on board the platform burns coal to raise steam for electricity generation, desalination, and process heat requirements. Scrubbed stack gas from the plant is processed to recover carbon dioxide for chemical make-up needs. The equilibrium isotherm and the diffusion constant for the uranyl-HTO system, which are needed for bed performance calculations, have been calculated based on the rather sparse data reported in the literature. In addition, a technique for calculating the rate constant of a fixed bed adsorbing system has been developed for use with Thomas' solution for predicting fixed bed performance. The URPE program has been benchmarked against the results of previous studies by ORNL and Exxon, and found to make comparable performance and economic estimates when applied under {{the same set of}} ground rules. The URPE code was then used in an extensive series of parametric and sensitivity studies to identify optimum bed operating conditions and important areas for future research and development. The program showed that thin beds of small, thinly-coated particles were the preferred bed configuration, and that actively pumped systems out-perform current driven units. Based on the URPE analysis, the minimum expected costs nof uranium recovered from seawater would be no lower than ~ 316 (1979 $) /lb U 308 for state-of-the-art adsorber material (capacity equal to 210 mg U/kg Ti), but might be reduced to the level of breakeven attractiveness of ~ 150 (1979 $) /lb U 30 8 if at least a four-fold increase in adsorption capacity could be achieved.
