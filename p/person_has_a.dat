5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> history of kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% {{of people who are}} intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal whether a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or {{an excess of}} hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E

25|$|To get an {{appropriate}} example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test {{that seeks to}} determine whether a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> certain disease.

A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease.|$|E
25|$|Clifford Geertz, a {{founding}} scholar of primordialism, asserts that each <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> natural connection to perceived kinsmen.

Ethnic groups will consequently always threaten the survival of civil governments but not the existence of nations formed by one ethnic group.
