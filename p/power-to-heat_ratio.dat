The thermal energy produced by a solar field is stored in a TES system and subsequently used in a Heat and Power Generation (HPG) section. In particular, three different HPG configurations are analyzed. The electricity is generated in an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit while the heat is supplied by a heat generator placed in parallel or downstream of the ORC unit or by recovering the ORC waste heat. An exergy analysis is carried out and the plant exergy efficiency is chosen as marker to evaluate the best configuration. Several <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratios</b> {{and the production of}} saturated steam or hot water are considered. The results show an optimum utilization field for each configuration. The use of a heat generator operating in parallel with the ORC unit is the only suitable solution for supplying high-pressure steam while its placement downstream of the ORC unit is appropriate for low-pressure steam and high <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratios.</b> The use of the ORC waste heat is an interesting option for the hot water production but it requires the full use of available heat to avoid significant exergy degradations...|$|R

A wide range of current units are modelled under different operating conditions representative of the United Kingdom to determine the energy and exergy flows from primary energy inputs through to low-carbon heating system and then to end use. The resulting performances are then analysed {{in order to provide}} insights regarding the relative merits of the systems under the different operating constraints that may be experienced both now and into the future. Although current mid-range systems achieve comparable performance to a condensing gas boiler, the state-of-art offers considerable improvements. Micro-combined heat and power units and air source heat pumps have the technical potential to improve the energy performance of dwellings. The relative performance and potential of the systems is dominated by the electrical characteristics: the grid electrical generation efficiency, the <b>power-to-heat</b> demand <b>ratio</b> and the availability of electrical export. For total power-to-heat demands below 1 : 1. 5, air source heat pumps have greater improvement potential as their energy efficiency is not constrained.

The study also investigates the effects of tourist flows on town's energy consumption by modelling energy scenarios for permanent and summer homes. Two long-term energy scenarios (to 2030) were modelled using the MarkAL-TIMES generator model: BAU (business as usual), which is the reference scenario, and EHS (exemplary household sector), which involves targets of penetration for renewables and micro-cogeneration. The analysis demonstrated the critical role of end-use energy efficiency in curbing residential consumption. Cogeneration and renewables (PV (photovoltaic) and solar thermal panels) were proven to be valuable solutions to reduce the energetic and environmental burden of the household sector (− 20 % in 2030). Because most of household energy demand is ascribable to space-heating or hot water production, this study finds that micro-CHP technologies with lower <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratios</b> (mainly, Stirling engines and microturbines) show a higher diffusion, as do solar thermal devices.

40|$|The work {{deals with}} an {{innovative}} micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) unit based on Stirling engine technology. Although simplicity of design, low-noise operation and multi-fuel feeding make Stirling engines a promising micro-CHP technology for dwelling sector, <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is lower than}} alternative technologies (i. e. reciprocating engine, fuel cell, microturbine) resulting in poor global efficiency during low heat demand periods. Switching the system off and buying energy from the grid is demonstrated {{to be the best}} managing strategy in those periods, leading to fewer operating hours and longer payback time, especially in the Mediterranean areas. The present study investigates the application of a regenerative heat exchanger to recover part of the thermal power discharged by the unit when the heat demand is low to increase the electric efficiency of the micro-CHP device and its <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio.</b> The heat exchanger main design parameters are defined and the unit performances are discussed on the basis of simulation data. Fuelling the system with liquefied petrol gas (LPG), an electrical efficiency increase of 7 % is achieved thus offering interesting energy savings in dwelling sector. In addition LPG is characterized by lower emission than other fuels and can be applied in many areas not connected to the natural gas grid, improving the security of supply. A detached house is considered to assess the technoeconomic unit performances with or without the regenerator. The solution studied guarantees: i) higher Primary Energy Saving (PES) ii) six month reduction in the payback time, iii) 800 increase in operating hours, iv) higher end-user self-efficiency, aiding to reduce the electric input from the grid during peak periods and minimize the risk of congestion of the network.

In this paper, consequences regarding the technical performance for industrial combined heat and power applications are discussed and the most important design parameters are identified. Some GT types, which represent different stages of the developmental trend, are analysed in the simple and the combined cycle. Both the industrial and the aero-derivative GT classes are included. Conclusions are: (i) Generally, the developments have broadened the span of achievable <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratios</b> (α-values). Values between 0 and 1. 5 are obtainable for different GT-based schemes with acceptable total efficiencies. (ii) The total efficiencies achievable depend strongly, and differently for different GT types, {{on the nature of the}} heat demands in the industrial process. (iii) When opportunities do not exist to cool the exhaust gases in an economizer, i. e. when the stack temperature is directly given by process heat demands, the total efficiency is independent of the GT class. For both classes, however, the development has led to higher total efficiencies when the process temperature demands are high. (iv) When opportunities exist to cool the exhaust gases in an economizer (which is often the case for the simple cycle and always for the combined cycle), the industrial GT developments have given improved ability to reach a high total efficiency. The new aero-derivative types, on the contrary, are worse than the conventional ones in this respect. This can also lead to worse performance in combined cycles for the new aero-derivative types. (v) When supplementary firing is applied, however, the total efficiency is high and similar for all various units and conditions. The ‘new aero-derivative’ units have, in that case, superior α-values—especially in the combined cycle...|$|R

It can be observed that the specific fuel consumption increases along with a part of the condensation modes (α value increases). The correlation analysis of data has been carried out, and an equation linking the specific fuel consumption to the changes in the ratio of power generation to heat energy has been obtained.

The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EBPD) comparative framework methodology is followed. The local cost-optimal solution for an office building, in Helsinki, Finland is determined for each H/C-EGS {{as well as the}} global cost-optimum. The suggested energy efficiency measures get 144 building combinations, and alongside the H/C-EGSs, altogether 2304 cases.

Furthermore, biomass gasification {{could also be}} used for the efficient production of biofuels for transport. In this study, different applications of biomass gasification in connection to district heating (DH) are analysed and contrasted to conventional technology options. An application of the cost-optimizing energy system model MARKAL with {{a detailed description of the}} DH sector in a southwestern region of Sweden was developed within the study and used in the analysis. Policy measures for CO 2 reduction and for promotion of "green" electricity are assumed, and required subsidy levels for large-scale production of transport biofuels are calculated. The model also operates with different supplies of biomass: a local supply at a lower cost and an international supply of refined biomass at a slightly higher cost. The study shows that investments in BIGCC CHP are often cost-efficient in cases with low ambitions regarding transport biofuels. However, due to limitations in heat demand and in local, lower cost, supply of biomass, investment in biofuel production means less investment in BIGCC CHP and, thereby, a smaller electricity production.

Against this background, we analysed the technical potential and ecological impact of CHP (combined heat and power) systems on the German minutes reserve market for 2010, 2020 and 2030. Typical CHP plants (from 1 to 2800 kWel) were evaluated in relation to typical buildings or supply cases in different sectors. The minutes reserve potential was determined by an optimisation model with a temporal resolution of 15 min. The results were scaled up to national level using a scenario analysis for the future development of CHP. Additionally, {{the extent to which}} three different flexibility measures (double plant size/fourfold storage volume/emergency cooler) increase the potential provision of balancing power was examined. Key findings demonstrate that distributed CHP could contribute significantly to the provision of minutes reserve in future decades. Flexibility options would further enhance the theoretical potential. The grid-orientated operating mode slightly increases CO 2 emissions compared to the heat-orientated mode, but it is still preferable to the separate generation of heat and power.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of a {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system utilizing two power generation units operating simultaneously under differing operational strategies (D-CHP) on the basis of operational cost savings. A cost optimization metric, based on the facility monthly <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> (PHR), is presented in this paper.

40|$|The article unveils {{the mystery}} of cogeneration. Cogeneration is an add-on or {{embedded}} activity in thermal power plants, with as merit the use of part or whole of their point source heat exhausts. EU's talk of “high-efficiency cogeneration” is an unfounded transfer of responsibility from the hosting {{thermal power generation plant}} onto CHP (Combined Heat & Power) activity. The quality of a CHP activity is univocally defined by its design <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> σ, a tombstone parameter derived from the design characteristics of the power plant. A thermal power plant may house more than one cogeneration activity. Identifying σ requires positioning the bliss point in the electricity–heat production possibility set of the cogeneration activity. The bliss point is where after electric output is maximized, the sum of that output and the maximum recoverable quantity of heat occurs. Once CHP's mystery of virtual bliss points is unveiled, the proper σ are found. With known σ by CHP activity, the quantity of cogenerated electricity is reliably assessed as best indicator of cogeneration performance. Our analysis is applicable on all relevant thermal power cycles that host CHP activities, and illustrated with a numerical example. Our lean method is necessary and sufficient for proper CHP regulation. Peer reviewe...|$|E

To mitigate the associated environmental impact of this consumption, a growing interest has been developed in local {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) systems, due to their higher total efficiencies. However, CHP efficiency is highly dependent on the thermal output utilisation. In food retail buildings, where refrigeration dominates {{the building}} energy use, a promising means for utilising the thermal output is by using this to operate absorption chillers. This paper reports on a technical feasibility and financial viability study of an ammoniawater absorption chiller, coupled to a CHP unit, that is also compared to a conventional electrically-driven vapour-compression equivalent. A typical distribution centre located in the UK is selected as a case-study. Three alternative systems are considered: i) a conventional grid connected system; ii) a CHP system; and iii) a trigeneration system. Typical daily cooling, heating and hot-water demand data are provided on an hourly basis, and the system’s ability to cover these loads is assessed. The results indicate that the trigeneration system can reduce the electricity demand by 16 % compared to the baseline system, while offering a 48 % annual energy cost saving. The system’s primary energy utilisation rate exceeds 60 %, while the <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> of the building demand improves from 7. 0 to 0. 9, thereby more closely matching the CHP system generation profile.

However, bioenergy’s impact {{on climate change}} remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0. 024 and 0. 204 MJ (0. 86 MJth + 0. 14 MJel) − 1, and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented ∼ 67 % of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i. e., dLUC + iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8 – 114 %. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways.

A mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model has been developed {{with the objective of}} studying optimal operating strategies for DH systems. The model minimises the total operating cost of heat generation for a given DH system, which in this work is exemplified by the DH system of Göteborg, Sweden. The results should have important implications for operating strategies for DH systems as a response to future electricity price development. The results indicate significant changes in the operation of heat generation units in DH systems as a response to future electricity price profile with a, relative to today, high yearly average electricity price and more frequent high-electricity-price periods. The observed changes include a 20 % decrease in heat generation from heat pumps (HP) and an increase of up to 25 % in heat generation from combined heat and power (CHP) plants, owing to a switch in the merit order of these two technologies. We show that large fluctuations in the electricity price lead to an increased value being placed on CHP plants with variable <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio.</b> The results indicate that with reoccurring high-electricity-price periods the value of sold electricity alone can become high enough to motivate investment in CHP plants, i. e. indicating that the generation and selling of heat from CHP plants may not be the core business in the future.

40|$|The cost {{of energy}} for drying paper is {{substantial}} for the pulp and paper industry, and studies of various strategies for energy cost reductions such as increased energy efficiency, increased heat recovery from the exhaust drying air and reduced cost of the process heat are presented in this thesis. The energy use and cost studies were performed using a block-model based simulation tool developed for this specific purpose. For a multicylinder drying-section, the heat recovery potential was shown to vary from 25 to 60 %, based on total energy available in the exhaust air stream, as the dew point of the drying air was varied {{in the range of}} 45 to 70 °C. For minimum energy costs, the dryer should be operated at the highest dew point possible. Dryer-limited paper machines should, however, always be operated at the lowest exhaust air humidity possible since the revenue from the extra produced paper is much higher than the additional cost of energy. The use of drying-sections including gas-fired paper dryers was shown to increase the heat recovery potential by up to 40 %. However, due to the higher cost of natural gas and the reduced backpressure power generation with such drying-sections, the overall energy costs will be significantly higher. If black liquor gasification is implemented the produced syngas {{can be used as a}} substitute for the fossil natural gas. The process economics will improve significantly, especially if the gas is used to fire a combined cycle system and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine are used as make-up drying air in the impingement hood. At current energy price levels, in-house power generation based on biomass fuels is greatly favoured by the electricity certificate system, and the high <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> of the combined cycle system is thus favourable. Differentiated pricing of secondary energy was shown to be a useful strategy for promoting the recovery and reuse of such energy, thus increasing the overall energy efficiency and reducing the energy costs for the pulp and paper mills...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{economical}} and technical incentives {{to increase the}} efficiency of energy conversion plants. In this work we analyze these factors for Renova’s waste incineration combined heat and power plant in Göteborg. The company is interested in identifying solutions to improve the facility’s <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> in connection with plans to increase the incineration capacity. The plant has five main sections: waste pre-treatment, waste incinerator boiler with energy recovery for production of electric power and heat, flue gas cleaning, water cleaning, and cooling system with heat recovery for district heating. With a current incineration capacity of 460. 000 tons per year, the plant can handle waste for around 920. 000 person equivalents. At full load, the plant can produce 32 MW of electrical power and 150 MW of heat delivered to the local district heating network. The goal of this master thesis project was to investigate the potential for increased electric power generation at Renova’s waste-to-energy in Sävenäs, Göteborg associated with an increase of the waste handling capacity of the facility. The project includes an analysis of the steam and power section of the waste-to-energy plant in Sävenäs. GateCycle power plant simulation software was used to determine energy and mass balances for the steam system of the plant. Based on this simulation model and characteristics of the existing plant, different opportunities for increasing electric power production were investigated, including improved boiler steam data and increased steam turbine capacity. Five configurations were analyzed and compared on the basis of annual production of electricity and district heat, annual average electrical efficiency, and annual revenue from sales of electricity and district heat. The results of the project indicate that according to the plant characteristics and operating limits, the most attractive solution is to build the new incineration line boiler with advanced boiler technology and steam data of 450 ° C and 60 bar.

40|$|The net zero energy {{building}} (NZEB) {{has been}} paid attention to internationally through last decade. Under the Finnish circumstances, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and information that can help decision makers to define the NZEB consistently. In this thesis, some of the most important aspects of the NZEB and its applicability are investigated comprehensively. These aspects are the balance metric, energy matching capability, and economic viability. Integrating renewable energy systems with high efficient energy buildings to fulfill the NZEB balance is inevitable. More attention is paid to micro and small scale multi-generation systems including combined heat and power (CHP) technologies and combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP). The multi-generation systems provide energy efficiency and environmental benefits due to generating on-site electrical and thermal power for a building simultaneously. The results show that regarding the NZEB balance metric, based on the Finnish data, the four common NZEB definitions are ordered according to the easiness of achievement as follows (1) NZEB-Finnish CO 2 eq-emission (2) NZEB-Finnish primary energy (3) NZEB-cost and (4) NZEB-site. Domestic scale biomass CHP is not the best solution for the NZEB to replace a centralized power supply. Regarding the energy matching analysis, an overall weighted matching index (WMI) is developed. It combines the extended matching indices handling on-site energy systems involving electrical and thermal energy forms, energy conversions, various storages, and hybrid grid connections multiplied by certain weighting factors expressing the preferences of each. The WMI weighting factor calculation model is proposed physically and mathematically. An example for a micro-cogeneration application is conducted to illustrate the operability and comprehensiveness of using the WMI. The WMI's weighting factor calculation model proves that it is generic and applicable to hybrid micro-generation options. Regarding economic viability, the investigated biomass-based CHPs are economically viable only with high overall efficiency and low <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio</b> due to both low investment and operational costs. The biomass-based CCHPs do not have economic or environmental benefits over the biomass-based CHPs. This thesis shows that bioenergy-based CHP technologies could be promising integrated renewable energy systems in Finland achieving the NZEB based on the community level rather than on the single building level. To achieve the NZEB balance, CHP's characteristics have to be well optimized in order to minimize dependency on solar energy, maximize energy matching, and minimize life cycle costs. The upcoming legislation of nearly and net ZEB has to take the outputs of this thesis into consideration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the future}} {{greenhouse}} gas emission targets will be more ambitious and therefore solutions for of CO 2 emissions reduction more than 80 % are sought. In thermal power plants these high levels of emission reductions can be reached with CCS technologies or by utilizing high shares of biomass based fuels. Following from the national targets of Finland, the power plants being planned at the moment need to take these targets into account in the planning phase as options {{that need to be}} fulfilled at least in the future if not immediately. In this paper high plant level CO 2 emission reduction targets are analysed for two large power plants that are planned to be constructed in Finland in the near future. Both are located close to urban areas and supply also district heat to neighboring cities. Both also face high political pressure to significant emission reductions in comparison to existing system. This paper is based on a case study of a planned combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Finland having fuel power of 420 MWfuel. The boiler island is plant based on circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler technology enabling combustion of high shares of biomass. The paper is shortly describing technologies that are needed for reduction of CO 2 emissions when carbon capture based on oxyfuel technology and biomass firing based on high shares of forest residues are considered. The implications of applying these technologies and suitability for CHP environment are considered and economic feasibility of the solutions compared. Also the possibilities and feasibility of reaching negative emissions with combination of biomass firing and CCS is briefly assessed. Re**sults show significant emission reduction potential associated to both technologies. The major costs associated to CCS are caused by the equipment investment, loss of electricity production due to energy penalty and transportation and storage of CO 2. The costs associated to biomass combustion with high shares are mainly caused by higher prices of biomass fuel in comparison to coal and lower <b>power-to-heat</b> <b>ratio.</b> Large biomass share has an increasing impact also on plant investment and O&M costs. On the other hand, significant savings are achieved in terms of CO 2 allowances. When discussing the biomass option one must also address questions related to availability of sustainable biomass, effecting pricing and competition of raw material between different uses such as forest industry or liquid biofuels production. And this further highlights the discussion on carbon stocks and carbon debt especially when Bio-CCS is considered. If the profound emission reduction targets are to be met, economically the difference between the technologies considered is not clear in all circumstances. All the most important parameters for the economic lifetime of the power plant include significant uncertainty therefore in this paper main focus has been in sensitivity analysis. The study reveals some major economical restrictions of the applicability of these emission reduction solutions. The pros and cons of the technologies in the light of feasibility and the role of these technologies as carbon abatement tools are discussed. The major factor effecting the technology decision is plant location in relation to availability of biomass, coal and CO 2 transportation&storage options, as well as heat demand (possibility to utilize CHP) in addition to political atmosphere and acceptability of technologies...|$|E
