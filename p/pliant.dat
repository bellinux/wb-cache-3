5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the <b>pliant</b> House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, <b>pliant</b> bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders prey {{mainly on}} insects and by active hunting, females of Portia also build webs to catch prey directly. These capture webs are funnel-shaped and widest {{at the top}} and are about 4,000cubic {{centimetres}} in volume. The web is initially built in about 2hours, and then gradually made stronger. A Portia often joins her own web on to one of a web-based non-salticid spider. When not joined to another spiders', a P. labiata female's capture web may be suspended from rigid foundations such as boughs and rocks, or from <b>pliant</b> bases such as stems of shrubs.|$|E

25|$|As regards politics, Shuvalov's life abroad {{was not as}} {{exciting}} as the previous period of his career. On Catherine II's request, he would go on diplomatic errands; thus {{it was he who}} persuaded the Pope to replace Durini, a Russophobic nuncio at Warsaw, with the more <b>pliant</b> Count Giuseppe Garampi.|$|E
25|$|War and {{division}} seemed {{to open the}} door for colonialism, and in 1897 German colonialists and missionaries arrived in Rwanda. The Rwandans were divided; a portion of the royal court was wary and the other thought the Germans might be a good alternative to dominance by Buganda or the Belgians. Backing their faction in the country a <b>pliant</b> government was soon in place. Rwanda put up less resistance than Burundi did to German rule.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the helmet was {{shattered}} either {{by the collapse of}} the burial chamber or by the force of another object falling on it. However, the fact that the helmet had shattered meant {{that it was possible to}} reconstruct it. Had the helmet been crushed before the iron had fully oxidised, leaving it still <b>pliant,</b> the helmet would have been squashed, leaving it in a distorted shape similar to the Vendel and Valsgärde helmets.|$|E
25|$|The Rohilla War of 1774–5 {{began when}} the Rohillas reneged on a debt they owed the Nawab of Oudh for {{military}} assistance against the Marathas in 1772. The Rohillas were defeated and driven from their former capital of Bareilly by the Nawab of Oudh {{with the assistance of}} the East India Company's troops. The Rohilla State of Rampur was established by Nawab Faizullah Khan on 7 October 1774 in the presence of British Commander Colonel Champion, and remained a <b>pliant</b> state under British protection thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} such an {{approach}} is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The tousled hair of Pluto, the <b>pliant</b> flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a <b>pliant</b> wife who will not interfere with his fun, {{but the truth is that}} he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a <b>pliant</b> daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E
25|$|Successful {{rebellion}}s begot more rebellions. Lan Xang's ruler Nokeo Koumane (Noh Meuang) also revolted c. November 1595. The Lan Xang rebellion was overdue. Nanda {{had held}} onto Lan Xang thus far only because his vassals were themselves weak. Neither Maha Ouparat (r. 1574–88) nor Sen Soulintha (r. 1588–91) {{appeared to have}} ruled beyond Vientiane. Anarchy reigned in the countryside. In 1591, Nanda placed a 20-year-old Nokeo Koumane, a son of King Setthathirath {{who grew up in}} Pegu, on the throne, hoping for a <b>pliant</b> ruler. The young ruler consolidated his hold over his realm by defeating Luang Praban, and finally declared independence in 1595. Nokeo Koumane now proceeded to attack Lan Na, briefly taking over Nan. Nawrahta Minsaw drove back the invaders, without receiving any help from his overlord Nanda. But Nanda caught a break. Nokeo Koumane died shortly after in 1596. His anointed 12-year-old successor Vorawongsa, and his father Vorapita traveled to Pegu to gain permission to rule. Nanda agreed to the request but asked Vorapita to be the regent. By the time, they arrived back to Vientiane, Lan Xang's historical rival Lan Na had revolted. Lan Xang declared war on Lan Na, not at the behest of Pegu but for itself. Although Lan Xang would not officially renounce all tributary ties to Burma until 1603, the mountainous kingdom {{for all intents and purposes}} was independent by 1597.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, deHavilland {{appeared}} in Elliott Nugent's romantic comedy The Male Animal with Henry Fonda, about an idealistic professor fighting for academic freedom {{while trying to}} hold onto his job and his wife Ellen. While her role was not particularly challenging, deHavilland's delineation of an intelligent, good-natured woman trying to resolve the unsettling circumstances of her life played a major part in the film's success, according to Tony Thomas. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Bosley Crowther of The Times noting that deHavilland [...] "concocts a delightfully <b>pliant</b> and saucy character as the wife". That year, she also {{appeared in}} John Huston's drama In This Our Life with Bette Davis. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel {{of the same name}} by Ellen Glasgow, the story is about two sisters whose lives are destroyed by the anger and jealousy of one of the sisters.
