5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, <b>punishing</b> those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} drugs were studied in pigeons whose {{responses}} were <b>punished</b> with electric shock during {{one component of}} a multiple fixed-interval 5 -min fixed-interval 5 -min schedule of food presentation. Most of the drugs analyzed for rate-dependent effects increased low rates of both <b>punished</b> and unpunished responding, while increasing higher rates less, or decreasing them; however, low rates of <b>punished</b> responding sometimes were increased more by pentobarbital, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide than were matched rates of unpunished responding. In contrast, d-amphetamine and chlorpromazine usually increased low rates of unpunished responding more than matched rates of <b>punished</b> responding. These two drugs also decreased high rates of unpunished responding less than they decreased high rates of <b>punished</b> responding. Thus, the effects of drugs on <b>punished</b> responding depend on the control rate of <b>punished</b> responding; however, the rate-dependent effects of drugs on <b>punished</b> responding are not always {{the same as they}} are for unpunished responding...|$|R

5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or <b>punishing,</b> and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including <b>punishing</b> bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E
5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by <b>punishing</b> opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on <b>punishing</b> the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis.

A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

40|$|Existing models {{suggest that}} {{reciprocity}} {{is unlikely to}} evolve in large groups {{as a result of}} natural selection. In these models, reciprocators <b>punish</b> noncooperation by withholding future cooperation, and thus also penalize other cooperators in the group. Here, we analyze a model in which the response is some form of punishment that is directed solely at noncooperators. We refer to such alternative forms of punishment as retribution. We show that cooperation enforced by retribution can lead to the evolution of cooperation in two qualitatively different ways. (1) If benefits of cooperation to an individual are greater than the costs to a single individual of coercing the other n- 1 individuals to cooperate, then strategies which cooperate and <b>punish</b> noncooperators, strategies which cooperate only if <b>punished,</b> and, sometimes, strategies which cooperate but do not <b>punish</b> will coexist in the long run. (2) If the costs of being <b>punished</b> are large enough, moralistic strategies which cooperate, <b>punish</b> noncooperators, and <b>punish</b> those who do not <b>punish</b> noncooperators can be evolutionarily stable. We also show, however, that moralistic strategies can cause any individually costly behavior to be evolutionarily stable, whether or not it creates a group benefit...|$|R
