40|$|The {{structure}} of vegetation, {{and how this}} structure varies across a landscape, is crucial to understanding the distribution of wildlife species. Between 2002 and 2004, we sampled small mammal communities and measured vegetation structure at 185 locations {{across a range of}} disturbance regimes in a shortgrass prairie ecosystem in southeastern Colorado, USA. At each sampling location, the local disturbance regime was some combination of varying intensity of livestock grazing, military training activity, and fire. Vegetation structural characteristics measured included percent bare ground, basal cover, litter, shrub density, and mean grass and shrub height. Rodent communities were described by richness, diversity, total and per capita biomass, and species abundances.

However, small rodent populations thrive in these fields and at times dig and consume newly planted seeds and seedlings. During 1983, no-tillage corn, wheat and grain sorghum fields in western (Red Willow Co.) and eastern (Saline and Jefferson Cos.) Nebraska were evaluated to determine the distribution and food habits of the rodent species present, the damage to crops, and the availability of alternate rodent food sources. During June (post-emergence) and August (maximum corn height), 676 rodents were captured in 11 corn fields, and during July, 105 rodents were captured in 2 wheat and 2 sorghum fields.

40|$|How does range {{expansion}} affect {{genetic diversity}} in species with different ecologies, and do {{different types of}} genetic markers lead to different conclusions? We addressed these questions by assessing the genetic consequences of postglacial range expansion using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing in two congeneric and codistributed rodents with different ecological characteristics: the desert <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys deserti), a sand specialist, and the Merriam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys merriami), a substrate generalist. For each species, we compared genetic variation between populations that retained stable distributions throughout glacial periods and those inferred to have expanded since the last glacial maximum. Our results suggest that expanded populations of both species experienced a loss of private mtDNA haplotypes and differentiation among populations, {{as well as a}} loss of nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) private alleles and polymorphic loci. However, only D. deserti experienced a loss of nucleotide diversity (both mtDNA and nuclear) and nuclear heterozygosity. For all indices of diversity and differentiation that showed reduced values in the expanded areas, D. deserti populations experienced a greater degree of loss than did D. merriami populations. Additionally, patterns of loss in genetic diversity in expanded populations were substantially less extreme (by two orders of magnitude in some cases) for nuclear SNPs in both species compared to that observed for mitochondrial data. Our results demonstrate that ecological characteristics {{may play a role in}} determining genetic variation associated with range expansions, yet mtDNA diversity loss is not necessarily accompanied by a matched magnitude of loss in nuclear diversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to monitor small mammal diversity, {{intersite}} variation, and seasonal fluctuations in population in four microhabitat plots at Indio Mountains Research Station, Hudspeth County, Texas. The survey began in July 2003 and lasted through July 2004 with nine sampling dates over the four seasons. One-hectare plots were established in four sampling areas which exhibit different substrates and vegetation types. The site with the highest number and greatest species diversity of small mammals captured over the four seasons was Agate Hill. It is composed of igneous rock and contains the greatest amount and most diverse vegetation of the four sites. The Echo Canyon site, characterized by rocky Cretaceous limestone and low plant diversity, showed the lowest number of captures {{as well as the}} lowest species diversity. A total of five species of small mammals were captured. The rock pocket mouse (Chaetodipus intermedius) was most frequently captured, followed by Merriam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys merriami). Winter was the most successful season, with the greatest total number of animals captured from the combined sites, while spring had the fewest captures. Each species favored different seasons, C. intermedius was most frequently captured during the summer, whereas D. merriami and P. eremicus were both captured in greater numbers in the fall and winter. Ammospermophilus interpres was captured once during the fall, winter, and spring at both Agate Hill and Snail Hill Draw. Neotoma leucodon was captured only once at Agate Hill, and that was during winter. ...|$|R
40|$|Many factors affect {{foraging}} {{behavior of}} rodents, including predation risk, which {{is thought to}} influence seed selection and seed handling by desert rodents in patchy environments. Understanding forces that drive seed selection and seed fate can aid understanding of rodents 2 ̆ 7 impacts on vegetation structure and dynamics. In a feeding arena study, we tested how indirect and direct predation cues influence seed selection and handling behaviors (e. g., scatterhoarding and larderhoarding) of two heteromyid rodents, Dipodomys ordii (Ord 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat)</b> and Perognathus parvus (Great Basin pocket mouse), foraging on three seed species. The indirect cue was shrub cover: {{one half of the}} arena had sagebrush shrubs present while the other half was free of shrub cover. Direct cues, presented one per trial, were (1) control, (2) vocalization of Canis latrans, (3) scent of C. latrans, (4) scent of Vulpes vulpes, or (5) vocalization of Asio jlammeus. We offered seeds of two native grasses, Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) and Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass), and the non-native Secale cereale (cereal rye), each in separate plastic trays. D. ordii preferentially harvested A. hymenoides while P. parvus predominately harvested A. hymenoides and S. cereale. P. parvus was more likely to scatterhoard preferred seeds, whereas D. ordii mostly consumed and/or placed preferred seeds in a larder. Neither indirect nor direct cues significantly affected seed preferences. However, both species altered seed handling behavior in response to direct predation cues by leaving more seeds alive in the seed pool, though they responded to different predator cues. The two rodents are expected to have different impacts on plant recruitment in both natural and managed settings. Variation in preference, as revealed in this study, could be exploited as a component of reseeding strategies at sites where estimates of rodent community composition are available. To the extent that predator cues alter handling behavior, they provide a potential tool in developing restoration strategies that minimize seed loss...|$|R
40|$|Of {{approximately}} 81 {{species of}} mammals present in Nebraska today, 55 {{occur in the}} Sand Hills, with an additional three species that are associated only with the Niobrara River. Nebraska {{as a whole is}} truly a crossroads for mammals because two-thirds of the species reach their distributional limits in the state (Jones, 1964). Most of these mammals are widespread species or are specific to the grasslands as a whole and are not affected by this sandy zone. Jones (1964) wrote that “only a few mammals are restricted to this area. Mostly it serves to filter western species moving east and, in part, eastern species moving west, although some of the latter have passed through the area along the riparian [river] community bordering the Platte River. ” On the other hand, the Sand Hills appear to be a barrier to the distribution of some mammals. The eastern woodrat is a southern species that during a warmer, wetter time moved north. Today an isolated population occurs only along the Niobrara River in central Nebraska. Another mammal, the olive-backed pocket mouse, is found north of the Niobrara River in Cherry County and in the Panhandle, but evidently it does not inhabit the Sand Hills. The Sand Hills, with their extraordinary variety of habitats from dune top to interdunal wetland and river bank, provide habitats for many different types of mammals. The drier upland Sand Hills have an abundance of plains pocket gophers, plains pocket mice, Ord’s <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats,</b> prairie voles, and deer mice. Wet areas are characterized by the masked shrew, jumping mouse, meadow vole, and muskrat. The open areas, such as ridge tops and blowouts, tend to be the best microhabitat for <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats,</b> which are bipedal and fast-moving; the dense grass microhabitat is favored by voles, which are quadrapedal and slow moving. Typically, <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are from western, drier habitats, and voles are from eastern, moister habitats. In the Sand Hills, however, these two mammals occur together because of the mosaic of sand and grass (Lemen and Freeman, 1986).

In Idaho, they are most abundant injuniper woodlands with rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.) and winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) in the understory, but also occur on shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) range. In Utah, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> have an affinity for sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, and saltbush (Atriplex spp.) communities. In Nevada, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are associated with big sagebrush communities. In Colorado, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> comprised 19% of small mammal captures in pinyon-juniper forest, scattered pinyon-juniper, and pinyon-juniper in canyon habitats. In New Mexico, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are found inyucca (Yucca spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), saltbush, and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities. They are particularly abundant in mesquite sand dunes. In Texas, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> occur in honey mesquite (P. glandulosa), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), yucca, sand shinnery oak (Q. havardii), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) communities. In southwestern Kansas, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are characteristic residents of sand sagebrush prairie.|$|R
25|$|When on {{foraging}} trips, <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> hoard {{the seeds}} that they find. It {{is important for}} a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least {{at one point in}} the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> and Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> which have overlapping ranges. Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing risk of predation. Being larger and more sedentary, they are better able to defend these larders from depredations by other rodents.|$|R
50|$|Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> occur {{mainly in}} semiarid, open habitats. In Nevada, they {{were trapped in}} desert scrub and gravelly soil, flat pebble desert, and washes. In Utah, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> have an {{affinity}} for open shrublands and grasslands on sandy soils. In southeastern Idaho, big sagebrush/crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) range, most Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> captures occurred on disturbed sites or areas of sparse cover: Russian thistle (Salsola kali), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), followed by disturbed areas seeded to crested wheatgrass, then undisturbed big sagebrush. In western South Dakota, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are associated with black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. In Wyoming, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are abundant in sand dune communities where vegetation is greater than 10 inches (25 cm) tall and bare soil exceeds 40%. In Colorado, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> were primarily captured in open areas with firm soil. Firm or lightly compacted soils are needed for burrow construction; highly compacted soils are too {{hard for them to}} dig. In areas of desert pavement or tough clay soils in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are confined to pockets of windblown sand and alluvial soils along arroyos.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of the dry}} desert {{environment}} that the Panamint <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> inhabits, it has developed a specialized way to metabolize water from their food that they obtain. These <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are able to excrete urine that is extremely concentrated {{as a means to}} retain water. When deprived of water, it only produces a small drop of urine every 1-2 hours. Surprisingly these <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> possess very limited means of temperature regulation, despite living in an environment characterized by wide extremes of temperature. Above 35 °C the Panamint <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> utilizes their burrows to help maintain homeothermy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are {{generally}} solitary animals with little social organization. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> communicate during competitive interactions and courtship. They do cluster together in some feeding situations. Groups of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> that exist are aggregations and colonies. There {{appears to be}} a dominance hierarchy among male <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> in competition for access to females. Male <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> {{are generally}} more aggressive than females and are more dominant over them. Females are more tolerant of each other than males are and have more non-aggressive interactions. This is likely in part because the home ranges of females overlap less than the home ranges of males. Linear dominance hierarchies appear to exist among males but it is not known {{if this is the case}} for females. Winners of aggressive encounters appear to be the most active individuals.|$|R
50|$|Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys ordii) is a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> {{native to}} western North America, {{specifically}} the Great Plains and the Great Basin, with its range extending from extreme southern Canada to central Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural habitat}} of Stephens's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> is sparsely vegetated {{temperate}} grassland. This habitat {{has been destroyed}} or modified for agriculture throughout the species' range; as a result, Stephens' <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It occurs sympatrically with the agile <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat,</b> but tends to prefer few shrubs and gravelly soils to the agile's preference for denser shrubs.|$|R

50|$|In New Mexico, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> annual home ranges in {{mesquite}} averaged 3.35 acres (1.36 ha). In Nevada sagebrush/grassland, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> home ranges {{were estimated}} as 1.53 acres (0.62 ha) by the circular method and 1.06 acres (0.43 ha) {{by the principal}} component method. Home range movements increased through spring and again in late fall and early winter. No {{significant difference was found}} between male and female Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> home ranges; however, female home ranges decreased during reproductive periods. Recapture data for Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> in Arizona indicated they do not travel far from the home range; most Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> were recaptured within 165 ft (50 m) of the original capture site. Data on the lifetime movements of individuals indicated most were recaptured within 330 feet (100 m) of the original capture site.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the more}} {{commonly}} studied Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> protects itself by predator avoidance, the desert <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> behaves more aggressively. [...] In {{the case of}} a snake, the desert <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> drums its feet and moves within striking distance of the snake and kicks sand in the air. Though this is an incredibly dangerous activity for a small rodent, it does these things to let the snake know it is alert to its presence. Snakes are less likely to attack a rodent if the prey knows the snake is there. Desert <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> exclusively kick sand due to their natural environment being characterized by loose sand dunes.|$|R
