5000|$|A {{common law}} rule [...] "that a {{freehold}} contingent remainder {{which does not}} vest at or before the termination of the preceding freehold estate is destroyed. Such termination of the <b>preceding</b> <b>estate</b> might result from the natural expiration of that estate, or from forfeiture, or from merger." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{executory}} interest is a future interest, {{held by a}} third party transferee (i.e. someone other than the grantee), which either cuts off another's interest or begins some time after the natural termination of a <b>preceding</b> <b>estate.</b> An {{executory interest}} vests upon any condition subsequent except the natural termination of the original grantee's rights. In other words, an executory interest is any future interest held by a third party that isn't a remainder.|$|E
5000|$|A {{remainder}} {{is contingent}} if {{one or more}} of the following is true: (1) it is given to an unascertained or unborn person, (2) it is made contingent upon the occurrence of the natural termination of the <b>preceding</b> <b>estates.</b> For example, if we assume that B is alive, and O conveys [...] "to A for life, then to the heirs of B...", then the remainder is contingent because the heirs of B cannot be ascertained until B dies. No living person can have actual heirs, only heirs apparent or heirs presumptive.|$|R
5000|$|The Fifth Estate is a {{socio-cultural}} {{reference to}} groupings of outlier viewpoints in contemporary society, and is most associated with bloggers, journalists publishing in non-mainstream media outlets, {{and the social}} media or [...] "social license". The [...] "Fifth" [...] Estate extends the sequence of the three classical Estates of the Realm and the <b>preceding</b> Fourth <b>Estate,</b> essentially the mainstream press. The use of [...] "fifth estate" [...] dates to the 1960s counterculture, {{and in particular the}} influential The Fifth Estate, an underground newspaper first published in Detroit in 1965. Web-based technologies have enhanced the scope and power of the Fifth Estate far beyond the modest and boutique conditions of its beginnings.|$|R
50|$|The name Cookley was {{originally}} Culnan Clif, {{a place for}} which there is a Saxon charter with a boundary clause covering a substantial part of {{the northern part of the}} parish of Wolverley and Cookley. The medieval village of Cookley lay on the opposite side of river Stour to the present village, next to Caunsall. It gave its name to Cookley Wood, a former common, also known as Blakeshall Common. Blakeshall was thus also part of the Saxon estate. The estate was granted by William I to Worcester Cathedral Priory, which already owned the adjoining estate of Wolverley. From that time, the two were administered together as the manor of Wolverley. Nevertheless, the Domesday Book extent of Wolverley can be explained in terms of the <b>preceding</b> Saxon <b>estate</b> of Wolverley only.|$|R
5000|$|In 1789, the Estates General {{was summoned}} {{for the first}} time since 1614. As Fénelon had wished in former days, an Assembly of Notables in 1787 (which already {{displayed}} great independence) <b>preceded</b> the <b>Estates</b> General session. According to the model of 1614, the Estates General would consist of equal numbers of representatives of each Estate, but the Third Estate demanded, and ultimately received, double representation, which they already had in the provincial assemblies. When the Estates General convened in Versailles on 5 May 1789, however, it became clear that the double representation was something of a sham: voting was to occur [...] "by orders", which meant that the collective vote of the 578 representatives of the Third Estate would be weighed the same as that of each of the other Estates.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Dryden {{published}} Riccardo Zandonai, A Biography, {{the first}} fully documented monograph {{devoted to the}} composer of Francesca da Rimini. Written specifically for this volume were forewords by Renata Scotto {{as well as the}} composer's daughter, Tarquinia Jolanda Zandonai. A second biography, Leoncavallo: Life and Works, with a foreword by Plácido Domingo and Piera Leoncavallo, appeared in 2007. An earlier edition, sponsored by Baroness Hildegarde von Münchhausen, who had purchased a large amount of the composer's <b>estate,</b> <b>preceded</b> this in 2007. Following the publication, Dryden took part in a series of interviews recorded for German radio (NDR) and the Bayerische Kammeroper. His most recent biography, Franco Alfano, Transcending Turandot (foreword by Magda Olivero), was released in 2010. For these monographs, Dryden himself insisted on translating into English all archival material from German, Italian, and French.|$|R
50|$|Castle Coole was {{constructed}} between 1789 and 1798 {{as the summer}} retreat of Armar Lowry-Corry, the 1st Earl Belmore. Lord Belmore was the Member of Parliament for County Tyrone in the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin and a wealthy heir to 70,000 acres of land throughout Ireland, acquired by ancestors with a successful background in merchantry. The income generated by the estates allowed Castle Coole to be constructed {{at a cost of}} £57,000 in 1798, equivalent to approximately £20 million today. The siting on the comparatively small 1200 acre estate in County Fermanagh was primarily due to its unspoilt rural location and natural beauty amongst ancient oak woodland and small lakes, yet with proximity to the market town of Enniskillen for the domestic labour necessary for a large mansion. Additionally, several smaller family residences had been built on the Castle Coole <b>estate</b> <b>preceding</b> the mansion, including a dwelling of the King James period (later deliberately destroyed by fire) and a Queen Anne house built in 1709.|$|R
