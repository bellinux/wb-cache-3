40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} {{and spatial}} dependence are two well established aspects of house <b>price</b> <b>developments.</b> However, {{the analysis of}} differences in spatial dependence across time and space has not gained much attention yet. In this paper we jointly analyze these three aspects of spatial data. We apply a panel smooth transition regression model that allows for heterogeneity across time and space in spatial house price spillovers and for heterogeneity in {{the effect of the}} fundamentals on house price dynamics. We find evidence for heterogeneity in spatial spillovers of house <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> across space and time: house <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> in neighboring regions spill over stronger in times of increasing neighboring house prices compared to declining neighboring house prices. This is interpreted as evidence for the disposition effect. Moreover, heterogeneity in the effect of the fundamentals on house price dynamics could not be detected for all variables; real per capita disposable income and the unemployment rate have a homogeneous effect across time and space...|$|R

The focus {{of this paper is}} on wheat as it is, together with rice, the most important food crop. The analysis focuses on the determinants of recent wheat <b>price</b> <b>developments,</b> in particular on the role of fundamental supply and demand factors and the financialisation of commodity markets, i. e. the increasing presence of financial investors. The paper gives an overview of the relevance of wheat in the global food production system, recent wheat <b>price</b> <b>developments,</b> and different determinants of wheat prices stated in the literature, in particular the controversial debate on the influence of financial investors. It adds to this debate by employing a basic supply and demand model for global wheat prices based on the main fundamental demand and supply factors stated in the literature. The model can replicate actual wheat prices up to 2006 / 07 but a significant divergence appears thereafter. This gap may be explained by non-fundamental factors, most importantly financialisation...|$|R

Well known economic {{concepts such as}} Hanaus pork cycle or Ezekiels cobweb theorem {{are based on the}} empirical analysis of pork markets. We analyze whether pork <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> in different countries have become more synchronised over time. In a first stage of our analysis, annual pork price data collected by the FAO reveals much heterogeneity of pork <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> across countries. However, for some groups of countries the observed price patterns are very similar or even identical. This is especially the case for neighbouring countries with integrated pork markets, such as the members of the European Union (EU). We then compare pork <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> in Germany and the USA based on 36 years of monthly producer prices for slaughter pigs. Since the middle of the 1990 s cyclical pork price movements in the USA and Germany have become increasingly synchronous. We attribute this to two developments: the fact that the USA has become a large net exporter of pork over this period, and policy reform in the EU that has strengthened the link between international and EU feed prices...|$|R

On the one hand, empirical evidence supports the view that interest rates are a key variable to explain house <b>price</b> <b>developments.</b> As a matter of fact, using simple asset pricing relations recent changes in house prices could be fully explained by movements in ex-post real interest rates. However, more refined asset pricing models show that {{the changes in the}} discount factor cannot fully explain the recent course of house prices in Spain.

40|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21 st century, house prices in the Netherlands rose sharply. In the period 2000 - 2008, the total average price of houses in the Netherlands {{increased}} by more than 59 %. However, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which marked the beginning of the recent economic crisis, house prices declined in real terms for the first time since the end of 2007 after a decade of a continuous price increase. At the national level, the housing market started its recovery in 2014 and this growth continued throughout 2015. The number of home sales as well as house prices have risen significantly. Explanations for these recent developments are the low interest rate, economic growth and increased consumer confidence. Nevertheless, the <b>price</b> <b>development</b> of housing varies greatly by region. The growth is faster in, for example, Amsterdam compared to Parkstad Limburg, as a result of demographic and economic developments. This raises questions about the extent to which the trend in house prices between regions can be explained in relation to demographic and economic factors, and how these will develop in the near future. This study focuses on an analysis of the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> in the Netherlands for the period 2000 - 2015. The aim of this study is to explain the development of house prices by house type and between regions in the Netherlands on the basis of demographic and economic factors. It also aims forecast the development of house prices. House <b>price</b> <b>development</b> refers to the fluctuation of the average purchase price by house type. In this study, we distinguish five types of houses: detached houses, 2 -under- 1 -detached houses, corner houses, terraced houses and apartments. A region refers to a COROP-area, also referred as a region on NUTS 3 level. COROP-areas have been defined in 1970 by the Coordination Commission for Regional Research Program such that each COROP-area consists of a central point (e. g., a city) and the surrounding economic and social region. The Netherlands is divided in 40 COROP-areas. Demographic and economic factors considered in this study are population, income and employment. On the basis of single and multiple regression analyses, the influence of these factors is examined on the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> by region and house type. This study shows multiple differences between regions and house types in regard to house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> The increase in the average price in sixteen years varies greatly between regions: from 16. 5 % in Zuid-Limburg up to 98. 9 % in Zeeland. In addition, the higher segment of the housing market (mainly detached houses) responds more strongly to the economic cycle than the lower segment of the housing market. This study also found significant differences in the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> between regions and house types. Each house type is significantly different in terms of the <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> In addition, 69. 9 % of all the regions differ significantly. This confirms the importance of segmentation according to different house types and regions in the analysis of house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> Moreover, further analyses also reveal that an increase of the total population, the total average household income and the number of jobs and businesses has a positive impact on the house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> The analysis also shows that demographic fluctuations have a bigger impact on the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> in areas with a declining population. In addition, this study reveals that demographic growth affects the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> more significantly than population decline. Furthermore, the income variable accounts for the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> better than population and employment variables. Subsequently, the historical house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> and the explanatory factors demography, income and employment are used to make a forecast of the house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> As demographic and economic factors explain the historical house <b>price</b> <b>development,</b> the anticipated development of these factors allow to predict future house prices. Particularly, demographic projections are to some extent useful in forecasting the house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> This study concludes that differences in house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> per house type between regions in the Netherlands are largely explained on the basis of demographic and economic factors. There are differences in the degree of influence of these factors. In addition, the explained variance differs between COROP-regions and house types. Nevertheless it is possible to make a reliable forecast of the house <b>price</b> <b>development.</b> On the basis of the analyses of this study and using demographic projections, it is possible to forecast the house <b>price</b> <b>development</b> for each COROP-area and house type until 2020...|$|E

In contrast, the gas market does not play a role for the pricing of Eurozone energy stocks. Coal <b>price</b> <b>developments</b> affect the stock returns of European utilities.
