These indices extend from simple indices based on some average quality to universal formulae that incorporate the full quality spectrum of the respective elementary aggregate.

Hence, our aim in this study was to assess the relationship between health indicators and <b>population</b> <b>indexes</b> (<b>population</b> growth and composition). Methods: The present study was conducted using panel data from 176 countries during 8 years from 2004 to 2011. Data were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank and analyzed with generalized linear square regression models using Stata version 10. Results: Our findings showed a significant association between health indicators (life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate) and <b>population</b> <b>indexes</b> (sex ratio, residential status, and dependent population). Life expectancy was decreased by 0. 35 with one unit increase in the dependent population. Furthermore, there was inequality in life expectancy among rural an urban subjects and was higher among urban subjects. Conclusion: There is a significant association between health indicators with age, sex, and residential status of the population. Planning and need assessment for population structure should be done by managers and policy makers...|$|R

We investigated the impacts of fire ants on the upland arthropod community on 20 - 40 ha study sites in southern Mississippi. Study sites were sampled from 1997 – 2000 before, during, and after fire ant bait treatments to reduce fire ant populations. Fire ant abundance was assessed with bait transects on all sites, and fire ant <b>population</b> <b>indices</b> were estimated on a subset of study sites. Species richness and diversity of other ant species was also assessed from bait transects. Insect biomass and diversity was determined from light trap samples. Following treatments, fire ant abundance and <b>population</b> <b>indices</b> were significantly reduced, and ant species diversity and richness were greater on treated sites. Arthropod biomass, species diversity and species richness estimated from light trap samples were negatively correlated with fire ant abundance, but there were no observable treatment effects.

40|$|Studies of {{multiple}} taxa across broad-scales suggest that species distributions are shifting poleward {{in response to}} global climate change. Recognizing the influence of distribution shifts on <b>population</b> <b>indices</b> {{will be an important}} part of interpreting trends within management units because current practice often assumes that changes in local populations reflect local habitat conditions. However, the individual- and population-level processes that drive distribution shifts may occur across a large, regional scale and {{have little to do with}} the habitats within the management unit. We examined the latitudinal center of abundance for the winter distributions of six western North America raptor species using Christmas Bird Counts from 1975 – 2011. Also, we considered whether <b>population</b> <b>indices</b> within western North America Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) were explained by distribution shifts. All six raptors had significant poleward shifts in their wintering distributions over time. Rough-legged Hawks (Buteo lagopus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) showed the fastest rate of change, with 8. 41 km yr− 1 and 7. 74 km yr− 1 shifts, respectively. Raptors may be particularly responsive to warming winters because of variable migration tendencies, intraspecific competition for nesting sites that drives males to winter farther north, or both. Overall, 40 % of BCR population trend models were improved by incorporating information about wintering distributions; however, support for the effect of distribution on BCR indices varied by species with Rough-legged Hawks showing the most evidence. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how regional distribution shifts influence local-scale <b>population</b> <b>indices.</b> If global climate change is altering distribution patterns, then trends within some management units may not reflect changes in local habitat conditions. The methods used to monitor and manage bird populations within local BCRs will fundamentally change as species experience changes in distribution in response to climate change...|$|R

40|$|We {{monitored}} cryptic herpetofauna at Savannas Preserve State Park, Florida, {{by combining}} artificial cover counts with a quantitative paradigm for constructing and calculating <b>population</b> <b>indices.</b> Weekly indices were calculated from two consecutive days {{of data collection}} each week for 7 months from mid-winter to mid-summer in three habitats. Seventeen species were observed at least once, and time trends using index values were followed for six species. Among these, abundance and seasonal pattern information were obtained for an exotic species (greenhouse frog) and a species identified by the Florida Committee on Rare and Endangered Plants and Animals as threatened (Florida scrub lizard). We identified winter as the optimal time in this area to monitor populations for conducting annual assessments. This combined observation and indexing approach could provide managers or researchers with an economical means to quantitatively <b>index</b> <b>population</b> trends for multiple cryptic herpetofauna species simultaneously. Using artificial cover to sample within a <b>population</b> <b>indexing</b> design can be generalized beyond monitoring herpetofauna. Other forms of artificial cover {{that can be used}} as observation stations include aquatic artificial substrates, artificial tree cavities, artificial reefs, and other artificial aquatic structures and artificial sea grass units, among many others, and a wide range of taxa are suitable for population monitoring using artificial cover as observation stations in the approach we present, including insects, soil invertebrates, micro and macro aquatic invertebrates, fish, crustaceans, and small mammals...|$|R

Adult-sized foxes killed by lynx during radio tracking were in normal condition and of prime age, and were killed after the assumed annual population bottleneck.

The annual lynx predation rate was 14 % on radio-tracked foxes and 4 % on snow-tracked foxes.
