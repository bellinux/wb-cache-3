50|$|Battalion (ages 12-18) is {{a program}} {{organized}} {{along the lines of}} the Boy Scouts of America. Each Battalion is headed by a Captain, an adult volunteer, who is assisted by other adult volunteers, called Lieutenants. At the Battalion level, considerable leadership responsibility devolves to the Brigadiers themselves. The student leader of the Battalion is the Sergeant (typically a high-school senior), who is assisted by Corporals and Lance Corporals, student leaders in charge of sub-units called squads. Brigadiers wear dark green uniforms that sport Activity <b>Patches</b> <b>marking</b> the accomplishment of various achievements. By earning Activity Patches and fulfilling other requirements, Brigadiers move up through the ranks of Explorer, Trailblazer, Guide, One Star, Two Star, and Three Star.|$|R
50|$|Stockade (ages 8-11) is {{a program}} {{organized}} {{along the lines of}} the Cub Scouts.

40|$|Some parasitoids deposit {{chemical}} signals after oviposition as {{an indication}} that the host has al-ready been parasitized. This marking can deter subsequent conspecifics or one’s self from laying eggs in previously exploited hosts, thus reducing the risk of superparasitism. We investigated the egg laying behaviour of the parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether oviposition, post-oviposition marking, or both together deter subsequent oviposition by conspecifics. We then tested the effectiveness of the deterring mark under natural conditions us-ing maternity assignment based on 14 polymorphic DNA microsatellite markers. The behavioural experiment showed that <b>patch</b> <b>marking</b> deters conspecifics from probing the host eggs, and ovipo-sition deters those that probe from laying eggs in previously parasitized host clusters. These results were confirmed by the maternity assignment showing that under natural conditions, host egg clus-ters are primarily parasitized by a single H. horticola female...|$|R
5000|$|Senator Edward Kennedy {{wrote in}} a report {{that was part of}} United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations {{testimony}} dated 1 November 1971, [...] "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow <b>patches</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "H".

In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.|$|R

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(4, 5) P 2] is a {{membrane}} lipid involved in several signaling pathways. However, {{the role of}} this lipid in the regulation of synapse growth is ill-defined. Here we identify PI(4, 5) P 2 as a gatekeeper of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) size. We show that PI(4, 5) P 2 levels in neurons are critical in restricting synaptic growth by localizing and activating presynaptic Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein/WASP (WSP). This function of WSP is independent of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling but is dependent on Tweek, a neuronally expressed protein. Loss of PI(4, 5) P 2 -mediated WSP activation results in increased formation of membrane-organizing extension spike protein (Moesin) -GFP patches that concentrate at sites of bouton growth. Based on pharmacological and genetic studies, Moesin <b>patches</b> <b>mark</b> polymerized actin accumulations and correlate well with NMJ size. We propose a model in which PI(4, 5) P 2 - and WSP-mediated signaling at presynaptic termini controls actin-dependent synapse growth in a pathway {{at least in part}} in parallel to synaptic BMP signaling...|$|R

40|$|The fitness {{consequences}} of superparasitism and {{the mechanism of}} host discrimination in Cotesia flavipes, a larval parasitoid of concealed stemborer larvae was investigated. Naive females readily superparasitized and treated the already parasitized host as an unparasitized host by allocating {{the same amount of}} eggs as in an unparasitized host. However, there was no significant {{increase in the number of}} emerging parasitoids from superparasitized hosts due to substantial mortality of parasitoid offspring in superparasitized hosts. Furthermore, the developmental time of the parasitoids in a superparasitized host was significantly longer than in a singly parasitized host and the emerging progeny were significantly smaller (body length and head width). Naive females entered a tunnel in which the host was parasitized 4 h previously and accepted it for oviposition. Experienced females (oviposition experience in unparasitized host) refused to enter a tunnel with a host parasitized by herself or by another female. In experiments where the tunnel and/or host was manipulated it was demonstrated that the female leaves a mark in the tunnel when she parasitizes a host. The role of <b>patch</b> <b>marking</b> in C. flavipes is discussed in relation to the ecology of the parasitoid. ...|$|R
50|$|The Ethiopian wolf has short guard hairs {{and thick}} underfur, which {{provides}} protection at temperatures {{as low as}} −15 °C. Its overall colour is ochre to rusty red, with dense whitish to pale ginger underfur. The fur of the throat, chest and underparts is white, with a distinct white band occurring around {{the sides of the}} neck. There is a sharp boundary between the red coat and white marks. The ears are thickly furred on the edges, though naked on the inside. The naked borders of the lips, the gums and palate are black. The lips, a small spot on the cheeks and an ascending crescent below the eyes are white. The thickly furred tail is white underneath, and has a black tip, though, unlike most other canids, there is no dark <b>patch</b> <b>marking</b> the supracaudal gland. It moults during the wet season (August-October), and there is no evident seasonal variation in coat colour, though the contrast between the red coat and white markings increases with age and social rank. Females tend to have paler coats than males. During the breeding season, the female's coat turns yellow, becomes woolier, and the tail turns brownish, losing much of its hair.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between HIP family proteins (HIP 1 and HIP 12 / 1 R) and clathrin {{is fundamental to}} endocytosis. We used circular dichroism (CD) to study the stability of an HIP 1 subfragment (aa 468 - 530) that is splayed open. CD thermal melts show HIP 1 468 - 530 is only stable at low temperatures, but this HIP 1 fragment contains a structural unit that does not melt out even at 83 ◦ C. We then created HIP 1 mutants to probe our hypothesis that a short hydrophobic path in the opened region is the binding site for clathrin light chain. We found that the binding of hub/LCb was sensitive to mutating two distantly separated basic residues (K 474 and K 494). The basic <b>patches</b> <b>marked</b> by K 474 and K 494 are conserved in HIP 12 / 1 R. The lack of conservation in sla 2 p (S. cerevisiae), HIP 1 fromD. melanogaster, and HIP 1 homolog ZK 370. 3 from C. elegans implies the binding of HIP 1 and HIP 1 homologs to clathrin light chain may be different in these organisms.
