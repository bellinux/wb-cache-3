5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{species in}} the park are 122, of which at least 97 are nesting. Important birds of prey with high {{conservation}} value include the griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, eastern imperial eagle and booted eagle. The park {{is one of the}} two nesting localities in the country of the lanner falcon and the common rosefinch. Rila Monastery Nature Park is an important sanctuary of the hazel grouse, rock partridge, western capercaillie, Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl,</b> boreal owl, black woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, red-breasted flycatcher, wallcreeper, Alpine accentor and Alpine chough. Most of the listed species have at least 5% of their total national population in the territory of the park.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E
40|$|Voles are {{the most}} {{preferred}} prey of <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owls</b> (Glaucidium passerinum) in Northern Europe, where the extensive snow cover may decrease the availability of voles. Snow cover may thus cause changes in the diet from what is expected {{on the basis of}} prey abun-dance alone. Food hoarding behaviour of <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owls</b> was examined in relation to snow cover. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owls</b> hoard small birds and mammals in tree holes and nest boxes on their autumn and winter territories. During five winters, we examined hoarded prey items from artificial hoarding boxes provided to <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owls</b> in central Finland. The most intensive food hoarding periods occurred before the fall of snow, during which 73 % of prey items were hoarded. Presence or absence of snow cover did not affect the number of hoarded birds, but snow cover dramatically lowered the number of hoarded voles. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owls</b> began to exploit caches before the beginning of the snowy season and stopped exploita-tion in spring. According to the high utilization degree of the hoarded prey, especially dur-ing the period with permanent snow cover, we suggest that the <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owl’s</b> food hoard-ing behaviour acts as a buffer for seasonal variation in food supply. 1...|$|R
50|$|Costa Rican <b>pygmy</b> <b>owls</b> hunt {{from a low}} perch {{in dense}} forest. They wait for small prey, usually birds, lizards or large insects, and then strikes in swift flight.

25|$|Owls, {{which may}} have {{dissimilar}} periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from golden eagle predation either. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and {{some parts of the}} Western United States. Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> (Glaucidium passerinum) and little owl (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large great horned, Eurasian eagle and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa). Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been predated by golden eagles in both North America and Eurasia. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, barn owls made up 4.5% of the diet, the largest known occurrence of that species in the eagles' diet. However, the great horned owl is the owl species that occurs most regularly in the diet of North American golden eagles. In Europe, golden eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian eagle-owls and northern goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are Ural owls (Strix uralensis) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Few eye-witness accounts are known of owl predation, but one violent mid-day confrontation between a golden eagle and an adult great horned owl was witnessed in Jefferson County, Colorado. Although this owl was {{about a third of the}} eagle's weight, it was able to land some damaging blows on the larger bird. In the end, despite its wounds, the eagle was victorious over the dead owl. A case of kleptoparasitism by a golden eagle on a great horned owl has been recorded.|$|E

500|$|Automimicry or {{intraspecific}} mimicry occurs {{within a}} single species. One form of such mimicry is where one part of an organism's body resembles another part. For example, the tails of some snakes resemble their heads; they move backwards when threatened and present the predator with the tail, improving their chances of escape without fatal harm. Some fishes have eyespots near their tails, and when mildly alarmed swim slowly backwards, presenting the tail as a head. Some insects such as some lycaenid butterflies have tail patterns and appendages of various degrees of sophistication that promote attacks at the rear {{rather than at the}} head. Several species of <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> bear [...] "false eyes" [...] {{on the back of the}} head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare.|$|E
50|$|The call is a whistled hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, {{usually in}} E flat. It is easily imitated, {{and is used}} by birdwatchers to attract small birds intent on mobbing the <b>pygmy</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>owls</b> are purportedly [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] predators, {{though they}} in fact hunt {{somewhat}} actively, moving from perch to perch with short flights, and pursuing prey {{at all levels}} of forest structure. They swoop down on prey; they may also catch insects in flight. They eat small mammals, birds and large insects, and may take a variety of other vertebrates and invertebrates. Mountain <b>pygmy</b> <b>owls</b> occasionally take prey species the same size or larger than themselves (e.g. California quail); however, small to medium-sized birds and small mammals are the norm. They've been observed eating Wilson's warblers. These owls are diurnal, and also active at dawn and dusk.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} {{other species of}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>owls,</b> this species is quite diurnal, and consumes both {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates. Nevertheless, owing to its small size and retiring habits -generally being perched in dense evergreen trees- it is not often noticed.|$|R
2500|$|Looking at {{variation}} in the behavioural responses of 22 different passerine species to a potential predator, the Eurasian <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Owl,</b> extent of mobbing was positively related with a species prevalence in the owls' diet. [...] Furthermore, the intensity of mobbing was greater in autumn than spring.|$|E
2500|$|The lake also {{attracts a}} wide variety of birds of prey. [...] There are seven owl species—northern <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl,</b> flammulated owl, boreal owl, spotted owl, barn owl, great gray owl, and great horned owl. [...] There are also American kestrels, {{peregrine}} falcons, northern goshawks, Cooper's hawks, red-tailed hawks, osprey, golden eagles, bald eagles, and turkey vultures.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than these}} two species, {{a large share}} of the {{raptorial}} prey for eagle-owls is made up of other owls. Given that all European owls are to some extent nocturnal, they may be encountered and killed upon detection by the Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, it has killed every other species of owl, from the tiny <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> and scops owl to the large [...] great grey owl and the [...] snowy owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the only raptor that has been known to prey on snowy owl on [...] multiple occasions. However, the threat Eurasian eagle-owls poses to other raptors can be exaggerated. Occasionally, with adequate mammal prey populations, they can nest as close as a few dozen meters of other raptors and never harass them. When nesting in the same groves as the [...] long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus) in southeastern Bulgaria, Eurasian eagle-owls did not predate the buzzards at any point. Long-legged buzzards have been killed however in Kazakhstan. Even in those occasional cases where they pick off one or several raptors, they do not effect the overall population, unless the raptorial prey is already heavily diminished due to some other (often human-based) cause. For example, despite both being a known predator both, they did not significantly depress numbers of either northern goshawks or tawny owls in southern Finland. One study showed that many raptors engage in spatial avoidance during potential encounters with Eurasian eagle-owls and while the predation by eagle-owls did decrease raptor population densities, they seldom caused declines in breeding success or altered habitat occupancy.|$|E

2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl {{is a very}} {{formidable}} bird of prey but its diet broadly {{overlaps with}} other European owls. All species of owl in the Europe and northern Asia hunt rodents, as does the eagle-owl, and in many the very same microtine rodents such as voles and lemmings will be favored. Even the [...] Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> <b>owl</b> (Glaucidium passerinum), at a whooping one-fortieth {{of the weight of}} an eagle-owl, will take much the same rodent prey as eagle-owls in adjacent habitats. The only European owls to favor non-rodent prey are the [...] European scops owl (Otus scops) and [...] little owl (Athene noctua), both of which most regularly consume invertebrates. However, little owls also take rodents and small mammals, especially in the winter months (while scops owl migrate to Africa for the winter). The European owls with the most similar diets to eagle-owls are [...] tawny (Strix alucco) and [...] Ural owls (Strix uralensis), although both are considerably smaller and less powerful and more specialized to hunt in wooded environments. These two Strix species are highly territorial and sedentary like the eagle-owl and capable of taking a broad range of prey, including good numbers of birds and larger prey such as rabbits (for the tawny owl) and hares (for the Ural owl) of up to at least twice their own weight. Studies have indicated that even while selected similar prey species as the eagle-owl, smaller owls including the long-eared, tawny and Ural owls select smaller individual prey items, being more likely to take small, juveniles rather than optimal, large adults as does the eagle-owl. Similar rodent prey is also often taken by many diurnal birds of prey, especially buzzards, harriers and small falcons. However, due its greater size and power than overlapping owls and smaller diurnal raptors, it generally takes more diverse and larger prey than most overlapping raptorial birds.|$|E
2500|$|Most dietary studies {{place the}} average weight of Eurasian eagle-owl prey {{in the zone}} of , thus the species fits well within {{the rule of thumb}} that most prey weigh no more than 20% of the {{raptorial}} bird’s own weight.
