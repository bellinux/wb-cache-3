The main contribution of our {{idea is to}} make the most use of the prior knowledge to constrain the processing <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> extraction. For human head shoulder images, we first detect face and a few facial features, which helps to estimate an approximate mask covering the interesting region. The algorithm then extracts the hard edge <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> from the specified area using an iterative graph cut method incorporated with an improved Gaussian Mixture Model. To generate accurate soft edges, a Bayes matting is applied. The whole process is fully automatic. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is both robust and efficient. ...|$|R

In general, foregrounding can be realized on various linguistic levels and it is possible to distinguish: Conceptual, Functional, Discourse and Pragmatic devices, which can be represented by various formal means: Phonetic-Phonological, Morphological-Syntactic and Lexical-Pragmatic. All the devices can co-occur during the information packaging. Some of them are obligatory and are on the high level of the hierarchically organized processes <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> (e. g. conceptual or functional foregrounding); some of them are optional and they are defined by the specific discourse and/or pragmatic values of a sentence (e. g. focus or topic); some forms <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> are implicational (e. g. sometimes reordering implies emphasis of intonation) and so on.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> object {{detection}} through background subtraction. Although eigenbackground models are successful in many computer vision applications, background subtraction methods based on a conventional eigenbackground method may suffer from high false-alarm rates in the foreground detection due to possible absorption <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> changes into the eigenbackground model. This paper introduces an improved eigenbackground modeling method for videos by recursively applying an error compensation process to reduce the influence <b>of</b> <b>foreground</b> moving objects on the eigenbackground model. An adaptive threshold method is also introduced for background subtraction, where the threshold is determined by combining a fixed global threshold and a variable local threshold. A fast algorithm is then given as an approximation to the proposed method by imposing and exploiting a constraint on motion consistency, leading to about 50 % reduction in computations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} comprehension of anaphoric pronouns in reading. Chapter, I explains {{the importance of}} this feature of text processing, and reviews the relevant psychological literature. One -important feature of pronoun interpretation is the fact that antecedents vary in accessibility in response to aspects of text content and structure; antecedents which are readily acessible to pronominal reference are said to be foregrounded. The most common theoretical explanation <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> is the claim that foregrounded antecedents are held in working memory. The review also shows reasons why good and poor readers might differ in sensitivity to foregrounding. Experiments 1 - 3 investigated the effects on <b>foregrounding</b> <b>of</b> pronoun-antecedent distance and of topical continuity. It was found that distance had no effect on ease of pronoun assignment provided the intervening sentences were closely related to the antecedent. When the intervening sentences dealt with unrelated topics, pronoun interpretation became more difficult. The working memory explanation <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> was investigated in Experiments 4 - 5, which found no evidence that <b>foregrounding</b> <b>of</b> an antecedent facilitated recognition memory for that antecedent. None of Experiments 1 - 5 found differences between the pronoun interpretation processes of good and poor readers. There then follows a critical discussion of the working memory theory, which argues that foregrounding may also be explicable by a theory stressing antecedent retrieval processes. Later experiments attempted to discriminate between these theories. Experiments 6 - 7 found that antecedent foregrounding was sensitive to the content of the pronoun sentence itself. Experiments 8 - 9 found that <b>foregrounding</b> <b>of</b> an incorrect antecedent did not hamper pronoun interpretation any more than neutral backgrounding. All the results of Experiments 4 - 9 contradict the working memory theory. It is concluded that the working memory theory <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> is inadequate to explain the present results, and that an account <b>of</b> <b>foregrounding</b> based on antecedent retrieval processes is a plausible alternative.

Additionally, we find that there are strong error correlations at high spatial wavenumbers that have so far been neglected in sensitivity derivations. These error correlations substantially degrade the sensitivity of arrays relying on contributions from long baselines, compared to what one would estimate assuming uncorrelated errors.
