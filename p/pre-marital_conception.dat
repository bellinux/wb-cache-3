40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis {{of exposure to}} sexual activity, contraceptive use, conceptions, and pregnancy resolutions among single women aged 15 - 24 in eight Latin American countries is presented. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys complete contraceptive and reproductive histories are constructed for single women aged 15 - 24 during the 5 year period preceding each survey. <b>Pre-marital</b> <b>conception</b> rates and overall and cause-specific life-table probabilities of contraceptive discontinuation are estimated. Pregnancy outcome and intention status of births are summarized. Trends in virginity, contraceptive protection, and conception rates for five sites are documented. In all eight countries, virginity accounts for over half of all single woman-years of exposure between age 15 and 24. The percentage of sexually active time protected by contraception is less than 20 % in five countries, is about 30 % in Peru and 50 % in Brazil and Colombia. The contribution of condoms to contraceptive protection ranges from one-tenth to one-fifth. <b>Pre-marital</b> <b>conception</b> rates among sexually active single women range from 14. 1 per 100 woman-years in Nicaragua to 25. 8 in Bolivia. Most pre-marital conceptions ended in live birth, and births that are legitimized by marriage or cohabitation {{are more likely to}} be wanted. In five settings, virginity has fallen over time, especially in Northeast Brazil and Colombia, and uptake of condoms has increased faster than use of other methods. Because of pervasive declines in the protective effect of virginity, conception rates among single women in Latin America are rising. Contraceptive uptake, particularly of condoms, is increasing but not sufficiently to offset the decline in virginity.

40|$|Abstract: The {{behaviour}} of {{the population}} of the Czech Republic has been chang-ing since 1991. The changes have resulted in a considerable decrease in marriages and births, and a slight fall in mortality rates. The decline in the number of newly-weds and new-born children can be attributed to significant structural changes in so-ciety connected with the transformation of the reproductive model established in the post-war era. The changes have been initiated most notably by the younger genera-tion, within which certain trends diverge. Some young people continue to enter into marriage at an early age, and half of first children were the product of <b>pre-marital</b> <b>conception.</b> Another part of this generation has been postponing both marriage and childbearing, and this portion has been growing rapidly. The present decline in mar-riages appears to be due to two factors: the higher age at which people are marrying for the first time, and falling marriage rates in general (the increasing proportion of never-married persons in the population). Similarly, the decline in births was caused not only by an earlier trend towards lower fertility but also a lower proportion of people living in wedlock. Hence the expectation that in the second half of the 1990...|$|E
40|$|U radu se analizira stanovništvo Rogotina pored Ploča na kraju 18. i prvoj polovici 19. stoljeća, na temelju matičnih knjiga rođenih, vjenčanih i umrlih, te stanja duša. Uz antroponimijsku analizu, prikazuju se i osnovna obilježja vitalnih događaja (natalitet, nupcijalitet, mortalitet), a zasebno se analizira stanje duša za svaku dostupnu godinu. Pri tome se nastoji odgovoriti koliko se Rogotin uklapa u sliku Dalmacije. U zaključnoj ocjeni se ističe povezanost s regionalnim kretanjima, ali i neki pokazatelji koji se mogu smatrati lokalnim specifičnostima. The article {{analyzes}} {{the population of}} Rogotin near Ploče {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth century on the basis of information derived from parish registers of births, marriages and deaths, but also from the Status Animarum. In addition to anthroponymic analysis of personal names, nicknames and surnames, the article affords evidence on the basic demographic determinants (natality, nuptiality, mortality), as well as the structural breakdown by confession and occupation. Compared with Dalmatia, Rogotin shows a major deviation in the decline of <b>pre-marital</b> <b>conceptions</b> which, together with a relatively small proportion of illegitimate births, testify to the strict moral attitudes of a small village community. A comparison between the places of origin of married women and those of the godparents suggests the prevalence of imported brides (mainly from the broader Neretva area), which ought to be viewed as evasion of the local marriage pool rather than establishment of lively relations with other communities. Rogotin mortality by age also differs from the rest of Dalmatia with an excess death rate of the middle-aged cohorts* of both genders. Most of other parameters, however, tend to follow the general demographic trends of Dalmatia...|$|R

In the conclusion I propose that illegitimacy among the French population in Tandil is a consequence of a different family conformation pattern from that of the native population...|$|R
