40|$|Broad-scale, multi-governance level, <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> {{processes}} {{intended to}} aid collective {{decision making and}} learning are rarely initiated, designed, implemented, and managed by one person. These processes mostly emerge from some form of collective planning and organization activities because of the stakes, time, and budgets involved in their implementation. Despite the potential importance of these collective processes for managing complex water-related social&# 8211;ecological systems, little research focusing on the project teams that design and organize <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> processes has ever been undertaken. We have begun to fill this gap by introducing and outlining {{the concept of a}} co-engineering process and examining how it impacts the processes and outcomes of <b>participatory</b> water <b>management.</b> We used a hybrid form of intervention research in two broad-scale, multi-governance level, <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> processes in Australia and Bulgaria to build insights into these co-engineering processes. We examined how divergent objectives and conflict in the project teams were negotiated, and the impacts of this co-engineering on the <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> processes. These investigations showed: (1) that language barriers may aid, rather than hinder, the process of stakeholder appropriation, collective learning and skills transferal related to the design and implementation of <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> processes; and (2) that diversity in co-engineering groups, if managed positively through collaborative work and integrative negotiations, can present opportunities and not just challenges for achieving a range of desired outcomes for <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> processes.

30|$|Since 1986 {{there were}} {{attempts}} made {{to manage and}} conserve ecosystems at BER at different institutional arrangement. Outputs of this research indicate that <b>participatory</b> forest <b>management</b> (PFM) was successful to reduce ecosystem change. This was because of resident community organized in groups have provided exclusive user rights and clearly defined responsibilities and decision-making powers by innovatively diversifying livelihoods from forest production, animal husbandry and eco-tourism (Girma, 2006). Similar to current study, Gobeze et al. (2009) have claimed that PFM have brought positive changes on forest ecosystem management while simultaneously increasing community participation, beneficence from the project and capacitating local level decision making. More importantly, PFM programs to rehabilitate alpine forest and woodlands ecosystem was integrated with national and sectoral policies where government is also a significant actor in ecosystem restoration program (Pistorius et al. 2017). Ecosystem management and landscape restoration works with government institutions is not successful as they fail to develop sense of ownership for participating community.

40|$|ABSTRACT — The paper {{discusses}} {{different approaches}} of watershed management programs implemented in South Asia, with special reference to India, based on existing literature and field experiences. Watershed degradation, particularly in hilly {{areas as well}} as water deficiency in draught prone areas {{due to lack of}} proper watershed development programmes, is critical Problem in India. A participatory approach has been adopted in watershed management during the last decade in many developing countries. <b>Participatory</b> Watershed <b>management</b> is meant for growing biomass, the pipeline for prosperity of the people for bridging the gap between poverty line and per capita income. In achieving this objective, the people’s part is awareness, participation and response. The state should revise the methods and methodologies as frequently as possible {{as long as they are}} appropriate and economical. Whatever may be the value of a plan, the impact of <b>participatory</b> watershed <b>management</b> depends on effectiveness of the technology in the background of needs, priorities, cultural practices and community participation.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} put forward by the need for massive change is that of high monetary and resource costs. For this reason, institutions often attempt to only partially implement <b>participatory</b> <b>management</b> or do so in stages.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the Chinese water sector has {{undergone}} an important institutional reform that has shifted major responsibilities in irrigation management {{from the government}} toward water users, organized in so-called Water User Associations (WUAs). Such <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> is not only assumed to increase water use efficiency, but also to stimulate the incomes of member households. This study aims to provide empirical evidence {{of the impact of}} <b>participatory</b> water <b>management</b> on WUA performance and farmer incomes, using data collected for the year 2007 among 317 households and 35 WUAs in Minle County, Gansu Province. We find that having democratically elected leaders has a positive effect on WUA performance, by increasing investment levels and improving canal quality. Participation in decision making, however, has a significant negative impact on canal quality and does not affect other WUA performance indicators. Two aspects of WUA performance, investment levels and financial health, are found to {{have a positive impact on}} the farm income of member households, while water use per mu has a significant negative impact on farm incomes. We find evidence that households belonging to better performing WUAs increase their farm incomes at the expense of non-farm income.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{the state of}} <b>participatory</b> governance and <b>management</b> together with the sustainable development principles in a rural cultural landscape, focusing on the specific case of Takht-e Soleyman World Heritage Site (WHS). Design/methodology/approach – The paper {{presents the results of}} an empirical study carried out within the boundaries of a well-defined Iranian location, the Takht-e Soleyman WHS. It is based on a rigorous theoretical analysis, accompanied by in-depth interviews with the key actors in the heritage management and governance sectors, and large-scale surveys of the local population through the circulation of a questionnaire. Findings – A measurable difference between the demonstrated and accepted theory and the <b>participatory</b> governance and <b>management</b> system implemented in Takht-e Soleyman WHS was observed, where the local community influence was found to be rather insignificant. Although the management plan of the site contains explicit clauses recommending and specifying the role of local community participation, strategies and mechanisms for implementing these measures are clearly under present. Originality/value – <b>Participatory</b> governance and <b>management</b> in a rural cultural landscape WHS are challenging concepts and the instances of their implementation require thorough analysis. The study detailed in this paper makes a valuable contribution to the debate on the design and implementation of <b>participatory</b> governance and <b>management</b> systems in this field by examining the actual extent of successful implementation of theoretical values in the case of Takht-e Soleyman WHS and identifying the key factors, which contribute to this state.

40|$|The <b>Participatory</b> Monitoring and <b>Management</b> Partnership  (PMMP) is an {{international}} collaborative network for local leaders and communities working with <b>participatory</b> monitoring and <b>management</b> of natural resources. The Partnership seeks to transform {{the way the world}} monitors and manages natural resources by improving the quality and extent of community-led approaches to resource management. To accomplish this objective, PMMP will support <b>participatory</b> monitoring and <b>management</b> worldwide and facilitate training, education, and learning from practice.     Why? Experiences suggest that local natural resource management and monitoring can support sustainable livelihoods. These practices can promote concrete and realistic solutions to the climatic, environmental and developmental challenges. Internationally and nationally, in many countries, natural resource monitoring has become a central issue in supporting decision-making processes at the local and large scale. Moreover traditional knowledge present in such management systems often complements scientific knowledge. At a meeting in Amazonas in September 2014, a total of 200 participants from 17 countries unanimously agreed to begin building a <b>Participatory</b> Monitoring and <b>Management</b> Partnership. The PMMP has the objective to promote and strengthen <b>participatory</b> natural resource <b>management</b> and monitoring.   Who? The <b>Participatory</b> Monitoring and <b>Management</b> Partnership will comprise of local and indigenous organisations, civil society organisations and government departments as well as other natural resource management bodies and the private sector working on participatory natural resource monitoring and management. The Partnership will also include individual community members, researchers and practitioners. We invite you and your institution to help us build this new Partnership.   How? The key activities of PMMP will be: 	 	Community to community experience exchange and networking 	 	 	Provision of strategic communication inputs and advocacy targeted at policy makers 	 	 	Capacity building, and education to the local and national partners 	 	 	Promotion of best practice approoaches through a ”community of practice” 	 	 	Joint fundraising for  collaborative activities on the ground 	 	 	Information exchange  on challenges and solutions related to the partners work with participatory natural resource monitoringusing the aid of social media and other tool...|$|R
