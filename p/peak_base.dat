50|$|Construction of {{the resort}} began in 1962 in the {{uninhabited}} valley. It opened six months later on 15 December. There were three lifts: one gondola that ran from Vail Village to Mid-Vail on the line where Gondola One operates. Several double chairlifts were also built: Golden Peak, which ran from Golden <b>Peak</b> <b>base</b> area up to the Riva Bahn Express midstation; Giant Steps, which ran from Vail Village {{to the bottom of}} the Avanti Express lift; the Avanti double chairlift; and two double chairlifts out of Mid-Vail, the Mountaintop and Hunky Dory lifts. A double chairlift, High Noon, serviced the Sun Down and Sun Up Bowls on the back side of the ridge. Vail quickly grew to become a popular ski resort, a village formed at the base, near the gondola, which was taken down in the 1970s and replaced with a Lift Engineering double chairlift.|$|E

50|$|For the 2013-2014 season, Doppelmayr built two new chairlifts. At Golden <b>Peak</b> <b>base</b> area, the resort's last {{remaining}} double chairlift, Gopher Hill (#12), {{was replaced with}} a recycled Doppelmayr triple chairlift purchased from Beaver Creek. The upgrade to Gopher Hill increased uphill capacity for the ski and ride school, especially for three- to six-year-old skiers and riders who must ride the lift with an adult. The bottom terminal was slightly moved from the original location. More significantly, the Mountaintop Express (#4) lift was upgraded to a high speed six pack. It was the first new Doppelmayr detachable chairlift to be built at Vail since the Avanti Express lift in 1989. It increased uphill capacity on the lift line by 33% from 2,800 people per hour to 3,600 people per hour, matching the uphill capacity of Gondola One. The new lift follows a slightly different alignment from the old lift, with the bottom terminal being moved 90 feet east of its original location to decrease cross-traffic in the area. The Mountaintop Express was the first detachable chairlift in North America to utilize a conveyor belt at the loading area, {{a system that is}} widely utilized at European ski resorts, shown to cut down on stops and slows, shortening the ride time (since the Mountaintop Express lift, almost every new six pack built at Vail Resorts properties has included a loading carpet, including the Colorado SuperChair at Breckenridge, the King Con Express at Park City Mountain Resort, and Vail's own Avanti Express lift).|$|E

The mean (μ) and {{coefficient}} of variation (c_v) values of the <b>peak</b> <b>base</b> shear for different heights of water under all three hazard levels of ground motions are shown in Fig.  14. It is found from Fig.  14 that the mean <b>peak</b> <b>base</b> shear values increase with an increase in the height of water and the hazard level of the ground motions. With height of water, the increase in mean values does not follow a linear trend. The local peak at 1.5 m of water (that was earlier observed for the RMS values) is not observed here. This is because the SAC ground motions do not have sufficient energy content to meaningfully excite a sloshing mode. The peak drift ratios (percentage values) also follow the same trend. The c_v values do not show any trend with water height. One can notice that as the hazard level increases, mean response increases and c_v reduces.|$|E

During the preliminary stages of design, a nonlinear time-history analysis is often not possible or too expensive, and hence reliable measures for predicting <b>peak</b> <b>base</b> displacement must be obtained through other means. In this study, regression models are developed in order to predict the peak displacement using a series of intensity measures (IMs) as model inputs. This thesis utilizes two methods for this purpose, Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a newly proposed method known as Sorted-Input Independent Component Regression (SI-ICR). In the framework of PCR and SI-ICR, the problem that exists due to correlation of IMs is addressed, which allows the transformation of correlated components into uncorrelated ones. This step is followed by dimensionality reduction of the components that do not contribute significantly to the explained variance of the original data set. A regression model using only one IM, peak ground velocity (PGV), is also developed to compare the advantages of using multiple IMs as opposed to one. Prediction results are presented and compared to simulation results for building models with increasing degree of complexity, starting with a two degree of freedom uniaxial case to a twelve degree of freedom biaxial model. It is concluded that PCR and SI-ICR significantly outperform the PGV model with PCR slightly outperforming SI-ICR. PCR is regarded as a more suitable and practical regression method for predicting the responses of nonlinear base isolated structures...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The steel diagrid {{structural}} {{system is a}} recent load bearing and lateral resisting {{structural system}} for tall building structures that is relatively unexplored in the western United States. One possible reason for the little use of diagrid systems in earthquake prone regions {{is the lack of}} guidelines and application examples illustrating the design and analysis of these structures. In this work, a prototype building with 72 stories is used as an example for which the design and analysis of the diagrid system is performed. To mitigate the possible large displacement and base shear demands that these structures may undergo under seismic events, two new design solutions consisting of one or two friction tuned mass damper (TMD) units are explored. In the first solution, a TMD is placed on the top four stories of the building and is tuned to reduce the contribution of the fundamental mode of vibration of the structure. The second solution uses a double TMD system, in which a second TMD unit - tuned to the second period of the structure – is added at mid-height of the building. Using a nonlinear finite element model of the tuned mass damper, the effectiveness of the friction mass damper design is studied. The mass damper system consists of a concrete tank containing sand or water. The tank is placed in between the building reinforce concrete structural core and the exterior steel diagrid system. This mass damper is connected to the structure using friction pendulum isolators which are chosen due to their ability to undergo large deformations. The models are then subjected to earthquake ground motions from historical shallow crustal and subduction-zone events. Parametric studies are carried out to optimize the mass damper design in improving the seismic performance of the building. Optimization of the seismic performance is assessed in terms of minimization of inter-story drift ratios, base and story forces, as well as floor absolute accelerations. The results show that the single TMD system can reduce significantly the <b>peak</b> <b>base</b> reaction and inter-story drift envelopes. Addition of the second TMD provides further improvements in terms of reducing the <b>peak</b> <b>base</b> reactions, while also producing notable reductions in peak absolute floor accelerations, which are not observed when only one TMD unit is used...|$|E
