50|$|Other {{than its}} direct {{use as a}} monomer, glucose {{can be broken down}} to {{synthesize}} a wide variety of other biomolecules.

40|$|Stored grain {{insect pests}} are an {{economic}} concern in Iowa. Growers {{should think about}} taking preventative measures now – before harvest – to protect grain quality. Infestations can directly reduce grain weight and nutritional value, in addition to indirectly causing mold and other contaminations. <b>Primary</b> <b>stored</b> grain pests feed within intact kernels while secondary pests feed on broken kernels or grain dust. Examples of primary pests include rice weevil, granary weevil and maize weevil. Common secondary pests are red and confused flour beetles, sawtoothed grain beetle, and Indianmeal moth.

50|$|Another of the {{difficulties}} of programming related to the two-level store of the machines. There were eight pages of Williams cathode ray tube (CRT) random-access memory as fast <b>primary</b> <b>store,</b> and 512 pages of secondary store on a magnetic drum. Each page consisted of 32 40-bit words which appeared as 64 20-bit lines on the CRTs. The programmer had to control all transfers between electronic and magnetic storage, and the transfers were slow {{and had to be}} reduced to a minimum. For programs dealing with large chunks of data, such as matrices, partitioning into page-sized chunks could be troublesome.|$|E

5000|$|A {{copy of the}} 4690 OS is {{maintained}} in each store controller. The 4690 POS terminals (registers) load a copy of 4690 from the store controller into memory when they Initial Program Load (IPL). The 4690 controllers provide terminal support {{in the form of}} terminal loading, price lookup, and transaction logging. Non-volatile memory is utilized to ensure that data is not lost in transit from the terminals to the store controller. Terminals are assigned to a <b>primary</b> <b>store</b> controller, and that controller is typically backed up by another controller. If the primary controller fails, the terminals automatically access the backup controller, providing uninterrupted sales at the POS terminal. If both the primary and backup controllers are unavailable, the terminal can go into a standalone state, or, some of the applications are capable of supporting a [...] "Terminal Offline" [...] (TOF) state wherein terminals run offline using a terminal-based item file and logging stored within their own memory.|$|E

40|$|As in Nebraska {{and other}} cattle-producing states, {{livestock}} {{are an important}} source of income for {{hundreds of millions of people}} living in developing countries. However, for livestock keepers in developing countries, animals are often central to multiple dimensions of the family’s existence, providing—in addition to income—important sources of energy-dense, nutrient-rich animal source foods, generating cultural status, including playing a role in family formation through wedding dowries, and serving, for some, as the household’s <b>primary</b> <b>store</b> of wealth. Livestock play all of these roles in pastoralist—semi-nomadic livestock-keeping—communi-ties. While in the past pastoralism was a relatively common way of life throughout the world, today pastoralists are few and typically inhabit marginal, rural lands, which makes it harder for them to access important services, such as education, and human and livestock health resources. Researchers also estimate that pastoralists are frequently among the poorest members of the societies they inhabit...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} study, grocery shoppers were interviewed {{to identify the}} factors that influence satisfaction with their <b>primary</b> <b>store</b> and the factors that encourage them to continue patronising this store despite being presented with an inducement to shop at another store. The study estimated two models; one predicting store satisfaction and the other predicting store loyalty. The results demonstrate that the significant factors that contribute to store satisfaction have little in common with the factors that impel shoppers to stay store loyal. Moreover, there was no evidence from this study that shoppers' overall store satisfaction was by itself a significant influence on their continued patronage of the store. Retail firms often do not recognise that the elements that contribute to customer satisfaction are different from those factors that help sustain store loyalty and consequently do not separate their resources between the two sets. Unless retail firms remain vigilant to changing consumer behaviour patterns, {{they will not be able}} to tell apart the elements of the retail mix that could typically insulate their primary customers from responding to special competitive offers...|$|E
