5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a <b>phone</b> <b>book,</b> DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed.

A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed.

Meanwhile, to get their picture {{on the cover of}} the new <b>phone</b> <b>book,</b> Bart and Lisa decide to enter an amateur photo contest.

While in the air, the two men fight about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that they no longer have ridiculous adventures.|$|E

25|$|Languages that treat {{accented letters}} as {{variants}} {{of the underlying}} letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. schon and then schön, or fallen and then fällen). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in <b>phone</b> <b>books</b> or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed e; Austrian <b>phone</b> <b>books</b> now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).|$|R
