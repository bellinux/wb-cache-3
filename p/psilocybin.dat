5|$|Tolerance to <b>psilocybin</b> builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting <b>psilocybin</b> {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A {{cross-tolerance}} can develop between <b>psilocybin</b> and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between <b>psilocybin</b> and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} <b>psilocybin</b> or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most <b>psilocybin</b> biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the <b>psilocybin</b> content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in <b>psilocybin</b> content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original <b>psilocybin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of <b>psilocybin,</b> and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of <b>psilocybin</b> without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated <b>psilocybin</b> from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified <b>psilocybin</b> is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of <b>psilocybin.</b> Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of <b>psilocybin,</b> because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with <b>psilocybin,</b> because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe {{authority}} Gastón Guzmán, in his 1983 monograph on <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms, considered Psilocybe semilanceata the world's most widespread <b>psilocybin</b> mushroom species, as it {{has been}} reported on 17 countries.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} <b>psilocybin</b> are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, <b>psilocybin</b> is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of <b>psilocybin</b> typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of <b>psilocybin,</b> the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. <b>Psilocybin</b> has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of <b>psilocybin</b> in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of <b>psilocybin</b> for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>psilocybin</b> may be {{prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The <b>psilocybin</b> present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by <b>psilocybin</b> have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than <b>psilocybin</b> itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of <b>psilocybin</b> daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) <b>psilocybin</b> in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of <b>psilocybin</b> in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the <b>psilocybin</b> analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of <b>psilocybin</b> content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms, {{including}} the bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of <b>psilocybin</b> mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of <b>psilocybin</b> is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg <b>psilocybin,</b> which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to <b>psilocybin,</b> such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to <b>psilocybin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of <b>psilocybin</b> {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of <b>psilocybin</b> on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of <b>psilocybin</b> was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal status}} of <b>psilocybin</b> {{mushrooms}} varies worldwide. <b>Psilocybin</b> and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{possession}} or sale of <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms {{is illegal}} in many countries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>psilocybin</b> {{contents}} of dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some <b>psilocybin,</b> while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing <b>psilocybin</b> also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original <b>psilocybin</b> session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 <b>psilocybin</b> users reported that their use of <b>psilocybin</b> had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used <b>psilocybin</b> mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. <b>Psilocybin</b> usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybin</b> is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. <b>Psilocybin</b> {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybin</b> is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested <b>psilocybin</b> is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed <b>psilocybin</b> is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral <b>psilocybin</b> dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. <b>Psilocybin</b> is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against {{the contention that}} the use of <b>psilocybin</b> puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders. An analysis of information from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed {{that the use of}} psychedelic drugs such as <b>psilocybin</b> is associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress, past year suicidal thinking, past year suicidal planning, and past year suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} structures of <b>psilocybin</b> and related analogs {{have been used}} in computational biology to help model the structure, function, and ligand-binding properties of the 5-HT2C G-protein-coupled receptor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but <b>psilocybin</b> has also been {{isolated}} from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, <b>psilocybin</b> is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{interruption}} {{in the use}} of <b>psilocybin</b> in research, {{there has}} been a general shift in attitudes regarding research with hallucinogenic agents. Many countries are revising their positions and have started to approve studies to test the physiological and therapeutic effects of hallucinogens.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} <b>psilocybin</b> mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybin</b> (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions, or under physiological conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybin</b> {{is present}} in varying {{concentrations}} in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms which evolved to produce the compound from muscarine some 20 million years ago. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: Psilocybe (116species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Hypholoma (6), Pluteus (6), Inocybe (6), Conocybe (4), Panaeolina (4), Gerronema (2) and Agrocybe, Galerina and Mycena (1species each). Guzmán increased his estimate {{of the number of}} psilocybin-containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. <b>Psilocybin</b> mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. Psilocybe species commonly found in the tropics include P.cubensis and P.subcubensis. P.semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed <b>psilocybin</b> mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although {{the presence or absence of}} <b>psilocybin</b> is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to Psilocybe in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the psychoactive compounds <b>psilocybin</b> and psilocin. Although <b>psilocybin</b> had once been reported from S.caerulea, subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of the substance in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} <b>psilocybin</b> are highly {{variable}} and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of <b>psilocybin.</b> They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with <b>psilocybin</b> prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that <b>psilocybin</b> heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{national}} survey of drug use by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded {{that the number of}} first-time <b>psilocybin</b> mushroom users in the United States was roughly equivalent to the number of first-time users of cannabis. In European countries, the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults (15–34 years) range from 0.3% to 14.1%.|$|E
5|$|Biosynthetically, the {{biochemical}} {{transformation from}} tryptophan to <b>psilocybin</b> involves several enzyme reactions: decarboxylation, methylation at the N9 position, 4-hydroxylation, and O-phosphorylation. Isotopic labeling experiments suggest that tryptophan decarboxylation is the initial biosynthetic step and that O-phosphorylation {{is the final}} step.) The sequence of the intermediate enzymatic steps {{has been shown to}} involve 4 different enzymes (PsiD, PsiH, PsiK, and PsiM) in P. cubensis and P. cyanescens, although the biosynthetic pathway may differ between species.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably <b>Psilocybin</b> mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|Most {{national}} drug {{laws have been}} amended to reflect {{the terms of the}} convention; examples include the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the US Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, Australia Poisons Standard (October 2015), the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of 1996, and the Japanese Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law of 2002. The possession and use of <b>psilocybin</b> is prohibited under almost all circumstances, and often carries severe legal penalties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybin</b> is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of <b>psilocybin</b> in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify <b>psilocybin</b> levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the <b>psilocybin</b> sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit <b>psilocybin,</b> and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where it grows singly or in small groups in clayey soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds <b>psilocybin</b> and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E
