50|$|Bobbin lace is {{also known}} as <b>pillow</b> <b>lace,</b> because it was worked on a pillow, and bone lace, because early bobbins were made of bone or ivory.|$|E
50|$|Hanslope was a {{centre of}} Buckinghamshire lacemaking in the 19th century. Early in the 19th century, Hanslope lace was noted as being {{particularly}} fine, and in 1862 about 500 {{women and children}} in the parish were employed making <b>pillow</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E

50|$|By 1870, {{virtually}} {{every type of}} hand-made lace (<b>pillow</b> <b>lace,</b> bobbin lace) had its machine-made copy. It became increasingly difficult for hand lacemakers {{to make a living}} from their work and most of the English handmade lace industry had disappeared by 1900.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} named provincial capital of La Mancha, a {{position}} it enjoyed from 1750 to 1761. The Conde de Valdeparaíso, unsuccessful in {{his attempts to}} permanently make Almagro an administrative center, promoted commerce, especially in textiles, encouraging the trade in appliqué lace and <b>pillow</b> <b>lace</b> (encaje de bolillos).|$|E
50|$|Cereal, vines, olives, {{and cotton}} are grown and {{cultivated}} here; {{there are also}} livestock and herding. There are also quarries of basalt and mines of manganese and plaster. A traditional industry is the fashioning of appliqué lace and <b>pillow</b> <b>lace</b> (encaje de bolillos). Other industries include woodworking and construction.|$|E
60|$|She looked {{long and}} earnestly, through her tears, {{at the young}} lady from the far away East as she lay against the <b>lace</b> <b>pillows,</b> her paleness {{enhanced}} by the pink gown, her dark hair in two great braids on her shoulders.|$|R
50|$|Maltese lace is a {{style of}} bobbin lace made in Malta. It is a guipure style of lace. It is worked as a {{continuous}} width on a tall, thin, upright <b>lace</b> <b>pillow.</b> Bigger pieces are made {{of two or more}} parts sewn together.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Lace</b> <b>Pillow</b> in Malta {{is known}} as [...] "Trajbu" [...] {{pronounced}} as try-boo , while the Bobbins are called [...] "Combini" [...] pronounced as [...] "chom-beany", this type of Lace making is very popular in Malta's Sister Island of Gozo, which is found to the North of the main Island.|$|R
5000|$|Brussels lace {{is a type}} of <b>pillow</b> <b>lace</b> that {{originated}} in and around Brussels. The term [...] "Brussels lace" [...] has been broadly used for any lace from Brussels; however, the term strictly interpreted refers to bobbin lace, in which the pattern is made first, then the ground, or réseau, added, also using bobbin lace. Brussels lace is {{not to be confused with}} Brussels point, which {{is a type of}} needle lace, though is sometimes also called [...] "Brussels lace".|$|E
5000|$|Bobbinet tulle or genuine tulle is a {{specific}} type of tulle which has been made in the United Kingdom since the invention of the bobbinet machine [...] Heathcoat coined the term [...] "bobbin net", or bobbinet as it is spelled today, to distinguish this machine-made tulle from the handmade [...] "pillow lace". <b>Pillow</b> <b>lace,</b> called so because of the pillow used to produce handmade bobbin lace. Machines based on his original designs are still in operation today producing fabrics in Perry Street, Chard, Somerset, UK.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the years, the Desert Inn {{has been}} a trading post, gas station, and dance hall. In 1994, after being added to the National Register of Historic Places, the unused rooms about the {{restaurant}} were converted into a modest museum that featured a bordello suite with red carpet, <b>lace</b> <b>pillows</b> and a swing.|$|R
50|$|Bobbin lace is a lace textile made by {{braiding}} {{and twisting}} lengths of thread, which are wound on bobbins to manage them. As the work progresses, the weaving {{is held in}} place with pins set in a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow,</b> {{the placement of the}} pins usually determined by a pattern or pricking pinned on the pillow.|$|R
50|$|Mesh {{grounded}} lace is {{a continuous}} bobbin lace {{also known as}} straight lace. Continuous bobbin lace is made in one piece on a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow.</b> The threads of the ground enter motifs, then leave to join the ground again further down the process, all made in one go. This is different to part lace, where the motifs are created separately, then joined together afterwards.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{an early}} autumn evening when the belfry stood out {{beautiful}} against the sunset sky, and the storks with their young fledglings were wheeling homewards to their nest on the roof, that Leonard {{was lying on the}} deep oriel window of the guest-chamber, and Grisell sat opposite to him with a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow</b> on her lap, weaving after the pattern of Wilton for a Church vestment.|$|R
50|$|An early type of pillow {{can be seen}} in The Lace-Maker by Caspar Netscher. The pillow has {{a wooden}} frame, and is {{slightly}} sloping. The lace-maker rests it on her lap. The bolster or cylindrical pillow was much cheaper to make as it is just a fabric bag stuffed with straw. It was used in Bedfordshire lace. It needs a stand as it does not have a flat bottom. Usually the bolster had the pattern pinned round the cylinder, so by turning the <b>pillow,</b> the <b>lace</b> could be as long as was needed. However, Maltese lacemakers used the pillow the other way. They had a long thin pillow, which they rested against something. Then they worked the lace {{down the length of the}} pillow.|$|R
50|$|Bucks Point has a gimp thread {{outlining}} the pattern. It usually has Point ground or sometimes Honeycomb ground. It {{is made in}} one piece on the <b>lace</b> <b>pillow,</b> at full width and not in strips like Honiton lace. Common designs are floral and geometric. The floral designs are like those in Mechlin and Lille laces, but Bucks lace is generally simpler than the Belgian laces, and is made of linen or silk. It can have picots along the edge.|$|R
25|$|Traditional Maltese lace (Maltese: bizzilla) is {{bobbin lace}} of the filet-guipure variety. It is formed on a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow</b> stuffed with straw, and {{frequently}} features the eight-pointed Maltese cross, but not necessarily. Genoese-style leafwork {{is an essential}} component of the traditional designs. Nowadays, Malta lace is usually worked on ivory-coloured linen, although historically it was also worked on black or white silk. It is typically used to make tablecloths, placemats and serviettes, and is periodically featured in couture, and in traditional Maltese costume.|$|R
5000|$|All {{bobbin lace}} {{is made with}} bobbins on a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow.</b> Some styles of lace are made in a {{continuous}} strip. Since {{there is a limit}} to how many bobbins can be handled on a pillow, this limits how wide the lace is. Part lace, on the other hand, is made in pieces or motifs. Once made, these are joined together in a ground, net or mesh, or with plaits, bars or legs. [...] This means that the lace has no limit in size, apart from the time needed to make it.|$|R
60|$|To Cecil {{this seemed}} the anxious desire for her lawful rights. She {{had been used}} to spend the greater part of the evening at the piano, but her awakened eyes {{perceived}} that this was a cover to Raymond's conversations at his mother's sofa; so she sat tying knots in stiff thread at her macrame <b>lace</b> <b>pillow,</b> making the bazaar a plea for nothing but work. Raymond used to arm himself with the newspapers as the safest point d'appui, and the talk was happiest when it only languished, for it could do much worse.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Maria Refugio Rudecinda Sepulveda, the first(?) daughter of Diego Sepulveda {{who was born}} on March 2 (?), 1848, in her burial casket, [s. d. ]. She can be seen lying down at center with her head at right; it is turned forward but her eyes are closed. She is visible wearing a fancy white dress and a crown, and can be seen holding a bouquet of flowers. Her head can be seen resting on a <b>pillow</b> with a <b>lace</b> cover and her body is resting on a sheet with zigzag edges. There is a fancy gold frame around the oval image...|$|R
50|$|Valenciennes lace is {{made on a}} <b>lace</b> <b>pillow</b> in one piece, {{with the}} réseau (the net-like ground) being made {{at the same time}} as the toilé (the pattern). It differentiates itself from other types of lace because the {{openness}} of the réseau, the closeness and evenness of the toilé, which resembles cambric, and that it lacks any cordonnet (a loosely spun silk cord used to outline and define the pattern). Also, in real Flemish Valenciennes lace there are no twisted sides to the mesh; all are closely plaited, and as a rule the shape of the mesh is diamond but without the openings.|$|R
5000|$|This {{painting}} was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1914, who wrote; [...] "79. THE LACE-MAKER. Sm. 112. In {{a room with}} an oil-painting on the grey wall, a lady is seated at work with a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow</b> on her lap. She wears a grey satin dress and a blue jacket trimmed with white fur. At her feet to the left is a cat. Signed in full in the centre at the top panel, 14 inches by 10 inches. In the Saxon inventory of 1722, A531. Now in the Picture Gallery, Dresden, 1902 catalogue, No. 1736." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{left the}} AEolian harp in the window, as a luxury {{if she should}} wake, and coiled herself up among <b>lace</b> <b>pillows</b> and eider blemos; and the hound coiled himself up on the gravel-walk, after a solemn vesper-ceremony of three turns round in his own length, looking vainly for a 'soft stone.' The finest of us are animals after all, and live by eating and sleeping: and, taken as animals, not so badly off either--unless we happen to be Dorsetshire labourers--or Spitalfields weavers--or {{colliery}} children--or marching soldiers-- or, I am afraid, one half of English souls this day.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{continuous}} lace, {{meaning that it}} was made in one piece on a <b>lace</b> <b>pillow,</b> using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or réseau. Antwerp lace {{is very similar to}} Mechlin lace, which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp lace is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin lace. It has a cordonnet, or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin lace does. The cordonnet was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp lace was also similar to Binche lace in its cordonnet. The réseau or ground for Antwerp lace varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin lace to a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.|$|R

"I am so much obliged," [...] said Fanny, as Mr. Touchett, {{after this}} defeat, rose {{up to take}} leave, and {{she held out her}} hand, smiled, thanked, and sent him away so much {{sweetened}} and gratified, that Rachel would have instantly begun dissecting him, but that a whole rush of boys broke in, and again engrossed their mother, and in the next lull, the uppermost necessity was of explaining about the servants who had been hired for the time, one of whom was a young woman whose health had given way over her <b>lace</b> <b>pillow,</b> and Rachel was eloquent over the crying evils of the system (everything was a system with Rachel) that chained girls to an unhealthy occupation in their early childhood, and made an overstocked market and underpaid workers--holding Fanny fast to listen by a sort of fascination in her overpowering earnestness, and great fixed eyes, which, when once their grasp was taken, would not release the victim; and this was a matter of daily occurrence on which Rachel felt keenly and spoke strongly.|$|R
