5|$|On 14 February in Vikersund, Prevc won {{the event}} despite sliding upon landing (he {{remained}} {{on his feet}} nevertheless), which rarely happens in ski jumping. By winning the second event in Almaty on 28 February, Prevc secured his first World Cup title, six events {{before the end of}} the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest number of points, victories, and podium finishes in a single season (2303 points, 15 victories and 22 <b>podiums</b> in total, the previous records being 2083 points, 13 victories, and 20 <b>podiums</b> by Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season). Other records include the point difference between the first and the second in the overall standings (813), the best average of points per event (79.4), and the highest number of points in the Four Hills Tournament (1139.4). By winning the ski flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a residential <b>podium</b> garden design {{can enhance the}} use of a garden and the satisfaction of its users. Two public and private housing estates are selected to analyze and compare spatial use and the perception of space in <b>podium</b> gardens for public use. First, this paper explores the relationship between residential satisfaction and the physical conditions of <b>podium</b> gardens in public and private housing estates in Hong Kong. A total of 135 questionnaires are collected from two cohorts for each of these groups. People’s perceptions are compared with the physical conditions of the <b>podium</b> gardens. Second, this paper investigates how visibility and accessibility influence the quality and usability of <b>podium</b> gardens. The sense of community, safety and hygiene, and accessibility are examined and compared between public and private housing estate cohorts. In conclusion, opening a <b>podium</b> garden to public use can promote the degree of tolerance and enhance community cohesion. Regardless of whether a <b>podium</b> garden {{is open to the public}} or not, according to the responses, more people using the <b>podium</b> garden can increase its usability. Since public monitoring can enhance safety and hygiene, <b>podium</b> gardens should be highly visible from the surrounding buildings. A well-planned <b>podium</b> design thus can improve the social and physical qualities of living environments...|$|R

5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, <b>podiums</b> or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E
5|$|For the 1982 season, Toivonen {{switched}} to the Rothmans-sponsored Opel team, which was co-managed by David Richards. Toivonen's team mates were Ari Vatanen, who had won the previous year's championship (with Richards as his co-driver), the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae, the previous year's British Rally Champion and father of future rally star Colin McRae. In his Ascona 400 debut in Portugal, Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the rally before retiring five stages from the finish. He competed in only four more WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the Acropolis Rally and at the RAC Rally. In the European Rally Championship, he participated in four rallies, registering three <b>podiums</b> and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in one round of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship, where he finished tenth driving a Ralt RT3. In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit, Toivonen was 1.4 seconds faster than the team's regular driver Raul Boesel.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 season, Reutemann {{took the}} first three {{victories}} of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive BT44s. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the 1975 title. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver Carlos Pace at the Interlagos circuit in his native São Paulo. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races. Pace took another two <b>podiums</b> and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the 1975 German Grand Prix, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|After a {{score of}} ten starts, two <b>podiums,</b> three other top six {{finishes}} and five retirements, Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the 1984 season. He {{was linked to the}} lead drive at the Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot's new factory World Rally Championship team, but eventually signed to drive a Porsche 911 SC RS for the Rothmans-sponsored Porsche factory team in the European Rally Championship. The team was run by Prodrive, a new motorsport group set up by David Richards, Toivonen's former boss at Opel. His European season with Porsche {{turned out to be a}} success. He started with two retirements, a third and a second place, but went on to win five rallies in a row and led the championship from Italian Lancia driver Carlo Capone. As Toivonen had a contract with Lancia for the World Rally Championship, and Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio wanted Capone to win the European title, it was suggested that Fiorio might enter Toivonen in WRC events to keep him away from important ERC rounds. However, Toivonen's title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up to two months. He missed several events and finished second in the championship behind Capone.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{was signed}} as test driver for the Arrows F1 team for 2000, and also gained {{sponsorship}} from Australian beer company Foster's whilst competing in Formula 3000. Webber took victory in round {{two of the}} season at Silverstone, and finished the series with two fastest laps and three <b>podiums</b> {{on his way to}} third overall—the highest position of any rookie that year. Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive the Arrows A21 car, and rejected a full contract offer for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three-day evaluation test for Benetton {{at the end of the}} year, outpacing F1 drivers Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella at Estoril. The results were good enough to earn him the test driver role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss Flavio Briatore as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning Super Nova Racing team, and despite winning at Imola, Monaco and Magny-Cours, he finished second overall to British driver Justin Wilson. Webber was replaced as test driver for Benetton for 2002 by Fernando Alonso, but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside Alex Yoong in the Stoddart-owned Minardi team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since David Brabham in 1994.|$|E
