40|$|We {{incorporate}} normative motivations {{into the}} economic model of accidents and tort rules. The social norm {{is that one}} should avoid harming others and should compensate if nevertheless harm is caused. To some extent, this is internalized through intrinsic moral concerns; moreover, those thought not {{to adhere to the}} norm are met with social disapproval. Moral and reputational concerns are not strong enough, however, for injurers to willingly compensate their victims. Absent legal liability, normative concerns induce precautions to prevent harm but precautions are then socially inefficient. By contrast, <b>perfectly</b> enforced <b>legal</b> liability crowds out informal incentives completely (e. g., individuals causing harm suffer no stigma) but precautions are then socially efficient. Under imperfectly enforced legal liability, formal legal sanctions and normative concerns are complements and interact to induce more precautions than under no-liability. Intrinsic motivations, social norms, esteem, strict liability, negligence, crowding out...|$|R
40|$|We {{incorporate}} normative motivations {{into the}} standard, unilateral precaution model of tort. Individuals have moral concerns about causing harm {{and would like}} others {{to believe that they}} have such concerns. In the absence of legal liability, the occurrence of harm suggests low concerns and is therefore damaging to one’s reputation, which feeds back into incentives to take precautions. These nevertheless remain suboptimal if informal motivations are not strong enough for injurers to willingly compensate victims ex post. By contrast, <b>perfectly</b> enforced <b>legal</b> liability crowds out informal motivations completely (e. g., tortfeasors suffer no disesteem) but precautions are then efficient. Under imperfect enforcement, informal motivations and legal sanctions complement one another. With strict liability, individuals held liable suffer disesteem, there is motivational crowding-out but no net crowding-out with respect to overall incentives. Under the negligence rule, there is motivational crowding-in when image concerns induce bunching on the legal due care standard...|$|R
25|$|Importing {{books and}} texts across {{national}} borders {{can sometimes be}} subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned. Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely 'indecent' works that would be <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concerned. Canada has been particularly notorious for such border seizures.|$|E

Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position {{that some of the}} civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.|$|E
25|$|Hampton's {{story was}} very {{different}} from the one presented by federal prosecutors. He claimed Hutton had, in response to his cash flow problems, come up with the idea to sell not heroin but a fake, <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal,</b> he thought. Previous to the deals with the DEA the two had, he said, already sold it to one gullible buyer and that he solicited the agents in order to make more money. At no time had he ever believed the two were actually selling heroin, he claimed. He raised the entrapment defense but proposed an alternate to the standard entrapment instruction.|$|E
40|$|Statutory {{interpretation}} dilemmas {{arise in}} all areas of law, where we often script them as scenes of conflict between a statute 2 ̆ 7 s literal text and its animating purpose. This Article argues that, for an important class of disputes, this supposed discord between text and purpose is an illusion. In fact, lawyers are overlooking ambiguities of literal meaning that align well with statutory purpose. The form of ambiguity in question inheres not in individual words, but {{at the level of the}} sentence. What triggers a split in readings are verbs that linguists classify as 2 ̆ 2 opaque, 2 ̆ 2 which are <b>perfectly</b> common in <b>legal</b> texts: intend, impersonate, endeavor, and regard are among them. In ordinary speech we resolve their dual readings unconsciously and without difficulty. In law, however, our failure to notice multiple readings of ambiguous language has left a trail of analytically misguided judicial determinations and doctrinal incoherence across a broad swath of law, from disability rights to white collar crime to identity fraud to genocide. Drawing on examples from these areas, this Article uses the tools of formal semantics to expose the ambiguity of opaque constructions and to make visible the family resemblance among the ways we misinterpret them. It then turns to the question of why lawyers misread and what we can do about it. The converging literatures of language development and the psychology of reasoning suggest an answer. When we analyze opaque sentences explicitly as statutory interpretation requires (as opposed to spontaneously in conversation), we may be particularly vulnerable to cognitive bias. Factors peculiar to law tend to amplify and propagate this bias rather than dampen and contain it, but they may also point the way toward more sophisticated and reliable legal reading...|$|R
25|$|As {{the column}} passed the {{municipal}} swimming pool, a particularly dark {{part of the}} street (since a street lamp had failed), it was hit from behind by a bus belonging to the Chatham & District Traction Company. The bus was allegedly travelling at 15–20 miles per hour, although Carter and another witness estimated its speed as 40–45 miles per hour. The bus driver, John William George Samson, 57, {{had worked for the}} company for forty years, twenty-five of them as a driver. He was very familiar with the route. He had his sidelights on, but not his headlights; this was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> and considered to be normal practice at the time. Other bus drivers said that they were using headlights that night and in that location as it was particularly dark. Other drivers defended Samson's decision not to use his headlights.|$|E
25|$|Patronymics {{were used}} in {{official}} documents until the late 19th century. Finns did not address each other by patronymics in colloquial speech. The natural Finnish way of referring to someone's parentage is the genitive: Matin Olli ("Matthew's Olaf") instead of the solemn Olli Matinpoika ("Olaf Matthew's son"). When patronymics were no longer required in documents, they quickly fell out of use. They are still <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal,</b> but very rare, often representing a deliberate archaism. Unlike in Swedish, Finnish patronymics were not transferred into hereditary family names. Thus, the Finnish situation differs considerably from, for instance, Sweden, which has {{hundreds of thousands of}} Johanssons and Anderssons. The Swedish patronymics-like surnames are treated as any other surname. Real patronymics are handled like additional first names, i.e., one must still have a surname. An exception is Icelandic citizens resident in Finland, who are allowed to follow the Icelandic name tradition.|$|E
25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed to always be one step ahead of the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that someone must have bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped in a way that it was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS could have done it given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E

500|$|The {{next day}} the arrests were {{publicly}} queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W. C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, {{said that he had}} directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal.</b> Hastings immediately stood and protested, saying that the Act was [...] "one of the most dreadful things that has been done {{in the history of our}} country" [...] and that the internments and deportations were effectively illegal.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for {{cannabis}} possession. Soon after, Scottish {{police found}} marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As {{a result of}} his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8ounces (200g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: [...] "cannabis is... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal...</b> I don't think... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever." [...] In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: [...] "People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong." [...] He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.|$|E

As also reported in the press, contrary reactions have come from some Internet users, who have called on people to [...] "descend on the village to snap their own <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> photographs". Broughton now appears on Google's Street View service.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey {{had used}} his {{excellent}} recall of details of crimes to trip up witnesses {{as a federal}} prosecutor; as a state prosecutor, he used telephone taps (which were <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> at the time) to gather evidence, with {{the ultimate goal of}} bringing down entire criminal organizations. On that account, Dewey successfully lobbied for an overhaul in New York's criminal procedure law, which at that time required separate trials for each count of an indictment. Dewey's thoroughness and attention to detail became legendary; for one case he and his staff sifted [...] "through 100,000 telephone slips to convict a Prohibition-era bootlegger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sprecher {{also found}} that the {{requirement}} to keep names and addresses of paraphernalia buyers created the same issue, since it might well have been considered probable cause sufficient for a search warrant. The village had likened it to similar records pharmacists were required to keep of Schedule V controlled substances. But he distinguished it by noting that the Schedule V drugs were themselves otherwise illegal to possess, whereas the paraphernalia was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal.</b> [...] "he record-keeping section implies that a customer who purchases an item 'designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs' intends to use the item with illegal cannabis or drugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable and {{influential}} precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century Nuremberg Trials. U.S. Justice Robert H.

Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression. The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 January 1698, {{he raised}} French colours {{and took his}} {{greatest}} prize, the 400-ton Quedagh Merchant, an Indian ship hired by Armenian merchants that was loaded with satins, muslins, gold, silver, an incredible variety of East Indian merchandise, as well as extremely valuable silks. The captain of Quedagh Merchant was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him {{the protection of the}} French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners, but they refused, claiming that their prey was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal,</b> as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French, if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to [...] "pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices" [...] for the [...] "notorious piracies". they had committed.|$|E
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{stories about}} Sheffey {{related to his}} power in prayer. Some of his prayers {{concerned}} critical needs of agricultural communities, such {{as the need for}} rain in time of drought or the prevention of rain during harvest. Because Sheffey hated the liquor traffic, his most remembered prayers were directed against stills and the people who ran them. According to an expert in the folklore of itinerant Methodist preachers, there are [...] "at least twenty-five accounts of how Sheffey's prayers led to the immediate destruction of whiskey stills and distilleries," [...] many apparently versions of the same episode. [...] (The owners were not moonshiners; at the time, distilling was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal.)</b> According to one minister, Sheffey prayed for the destruction of three distilleries on a creek near where they had been preaching. The minister claimed the proprietor of one still, in robust health, died suddenly; at a second, Sheffey prayed that a tree would fall on the still house though there were no trees nearby, and a “great storm came and actually landed a tree on the still”; and a third still was destroyed by fire after Sheffey had spent a night in prayer against it. Men were said to have left the area rather than become the object of Sheffey’s prayers.|$|E

So, as the Frau lived a {{thousand}} years before the birth of common sense--say about a half century ago--when everything uncommon had a smell of the supernatural, there was nothing for it but to consider her a witch. Had she been very feeble and withered, the people would have burned her, out of hand; but they did not like to proceed to extremes without <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> evidence. They were cautious, for they had made several mistakes recently. They had sentenced two or three females to the stake, and upon being stripped the limbs and bodies of these had not redeemed the hideous promise of their shrivelled faces and hands.

His alliance with a gang of cutthroats had brought about a lot of cutthroating. But his conscience suffered no twinges. He remembered what he had once heard an old preacher utter, namely, that they who rose by the sword perished by the sword. One took his chances when he played with cutting throats, and his, Daylight's, throat was still intact. That was it! And he had won. It was all gamble and war between the strong men. The fools did not count. They were always getting hurt; and that they always had been getting hurt was the conclusion he drew from what little he knew of history. San Francisco had wanted war, and he had given it war. It was the game. All the big fellows did the same, and they did much worse, too.|$|E
60|$|And the Chief Inspector {{laughed a}} little angrily, a little scornfully. With {{a man of}} that sort scrupulousness was a {{misplaced}} and even an illegal sentiment. The celebrity bestowed upon Michaelis on his release two years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever since in his breast. It was <b>perfectly</b> <b>legal</b> to arrest that man on the barest suspicion. It was legal and expedient {{on the face of}} it. His two former chiefs would have seen the point at once; whereas this one, without saying either yes or no, sat there, as if lost in a dream. Moreover, besides being legal and expedient, the arrest of Michaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried Chief Inspector Heat somewhat. This difficulty had its bearing upon his reputation, upon his comfort, and even upon the efficient performance of his duties. For, if Michaelis no doubt knew something about this outrage, the Chief Inspector was fairly certain {{that he did not know}} too much. This was just as well. He knew much less—the Chief Inspector was positive—than certain other individuals he had in his mind, but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient, besides being a more complicated matter, on account of the rules of the game. The rules of the game did not protect so much Michaelis, who was an ex-convict. It would be stupid not to take advantage of legal facilities, and the journalists who had written him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional indignation.|$|E
