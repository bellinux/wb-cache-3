50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing chain cover. The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold.

A large number of assemblies was examined to determine the root causes of delivery problems. The analysis was based on the criticality of the ship need date. The root causes for the late assembly delivery were found to be inadequate material inventory levels in the warehouses, lack of fabrication timeline coordination between fabrication shops, late engineering drawing revisions, underestimated fabrication durations, late supplier delivery, late material purchase order placement, and lost material. Suggestions are provided to improve operational efficiencies by targeting the elimination of these root causes that result in the delay of assembly fabrication. Some include material ordering process reorganization, shop loading variability elimination, fabrication timeline alignment, metric realignment, and rework system prioritization.

40|$|Abstract. A 4 inch drill <b>pipe</b> <b>assembly</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe with 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD tool joints because the tool joints for 4 inch pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and tool joint and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / 4 inch OD tool joints are usually welded to 4 inch pipe. A 5 inch OD tool joint is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A 4 inch drill <b>pipe</b> <b>assembly</b> with a 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD tool joint {{has been developed}} that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four inch pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. !

Certainly, there are excellent targets for commercialization of new loop technology, such as commercial applications where space for the loop field is always an issue, and the opportunity to repurpose abandoned water wells that could serve residential customers without extending the depth of the well. Ultimately, driller pricing and competition will prove the winner.|$|E

40|$|This thesis work is {{a result}} of studies done at Saab Surveillance, with the {{objective}} to evaluate cooling technologies and find out which of them that are or are not suited to be implemented on a generic house and plug-in units, meeting the higher thermal demands of the future. This task includes five products, all with their own pros and cons created by Thermacore, a company of advanced cooling technologies with its European head office located in Ashington, England. First up was to realize under which circumstances these products were supposed to operate. This included application areas like land, sea and air which all have different grades of requirements set for today’s generic houses and plug-in units. To find the answers for these factors a trip to England and Thermacore was made and together with their engineers, hypothetical thermal simulations could be developed but also gather a wide understanding of each technology´s possibilities and limits. When all the information was assembled an extended evaluation process could be completed. The result showed that the superior cooling technology differed depending on mainly two things. The first one was taken in regard of which application area it was supposed to operate in but also where it is being implemented either in a generic house or on a plug-in unit.

30|$|This {{research}} {{developed a}} systematic method {{to evaluate the}} accessibility of pipeline maintenance. During the early stage of this research, we interviewed six experts to determine the requirements of pipeline design. After combining the opinion of experts with a literature review, we mainly focused our research on pipeline accessibility during operation and maintenance, which is rarely discussed in previous studies. We first divided pipeline accessibility into three categories, developed mathematical models, and discussed the ergonomic details of each different category. We then developed a system called VAO Checker, which integrated the user interface and visualization information {{as a tool to}} implement the proposed methodology. VAO Checker used a simple motion-planning algorithm to find a path with acceptable approachable accessibility, and programmed the mathematical models into visualization information indicating the visual and operational accessibility. We created an example case to validate the practicality of VAO Checker, and conducted a usability test {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this tool. The result showed that it is a useful system for pipeline designers and engineers. It considered the pipeline accessibility within multi-pipes and enhanced the spatial comprehension.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental rotating wickless heat pipe apparatus {{was designed and}} machined. The apparatus includes a rotating heat <b>pipe</b> <b>assembly,</b> test stand, spray cooling assembly, safety shielding, and instrumentation. A revised condensing limit for {{the operation of the}} rotating heat pipe was obtained by modifying Ballbeck's Nusselt film condensation theory to include the effects of a thermal resistance in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. Approximate results, obtained for half-cone angles of 1, 2, and 3 degrees, show that less heat can be removed than originally predicted by Ballback, and that the outside heat transfer coefficient can significantly alter the condensing limit. An improved Nusselt theory was developed which applies for all half-cone angles, and which includes the effects of the thermal resistances in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. This formulation led to a second-order non-linear differential equation for the film thickness which was numerically integrated using a free-overfall boundary condition at the condenser exit. Results obtained for a half-cone angle of 0 degrees are substantially less than the results obtained from the approximate solution for half-cone degrees of 1, 2, and 3 degrees.

40|$|The {{hybrid rocket}} is still sparsely {{employed}} within major space or defense projects {{due to their}} relatively poor combustion efficiency and low fuel grain regression rate. Although hybrid rockets can claim advantages in safety, environmental and performance aspects against established solid and liquid propellant systems, the boundary layer combustion process and the diffusion based mixing within a hybrid rocket grain port leaves the core flow unmixed and limits the system performance. One principle used to enhance the mixing of gaseous flows is to induce streamwise vorticity. The counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) mixer utilizes this principle and introduces two vortices into a confined flow, generating a stirring motion in order to transport near wall media towards the core and vice versa. Recent studies investigated the velocity field introduced by this type of swirler. The current work is evaluating the mixing performance of the CVP concept, by using an experimental setup to simulate an axial primary pipe flow with a radially entering secondary flow. Hereby the primary flow is altered by the CVP swirler unit. The resulting setup therefore emulates a hybrid rocket motor with a cylindrical single port grain. In order to evaluate the mixing performance the secondary flow concentration at the <b>pipe</b> <b>assembly</b> exit is measured, utilizing a pressure-sensitive paint based procedure. ...|$|E

Bridges are not addressed specifically {{in this document}} {{but many of the}} construction details, including the stream simulation bed, apply to bridges. To simulate a stream the structure must have been designed to fit well with and have minimal impact on stream dynamics and processes. Traditional construction methods are used for both embedded pipe and open bottom arch construction. In chronological order, the primary structure construction steps include prework meetings, surveys, traffic controls, dewatering, erosion control, clearing, excavation, foundations, bedding, <b>pipe</b> <b>assembly,</b> backfill and embankments, and rewatering. The single most important and unique detail to stream simulation structures is the simulated streambed inside the embedded pipe or open bottom arch. The bed is typically shaped to have a low water channel, margins, and banks and may include other large rocks added to simulate streambed roughness, stable banks and step pool. Bed construction requires unique effort and a combination of machinery and skilled hand labor to fit and arrange pieces to match the design interlock well and be durable. Protection of the aquatic environment is emphasized through minimizing turbidity and sedimentation. Additional aquatic organism protection can include collection and transport of species from the dewatered area, slow rewatering to avoid stranding, limiting toxic substances and noise, and reducing blasting effects.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} for failure at three different drill pipes. When drilling boreholes, for example in the Oil & Gas industry, a hole is drilled into the ground which can be several kilometers long. One of main type of problem that can occur while drilling is the torque on the drill pipe can cause it to break (called twist-off). This problem results in drilling delays. Twist-offs also usually results in loss of expensive equipment. Therefore, ALGOR software has been use as the FEA tool to do the analysis to reduce this problem. Six different values of torque range from 2000 N. m to 3000 N. m {{is applied to the}} end of the pipe stand which is consist of three assembly of pipes.

40|$|Conventional {{dry storage}} {{facilities}} for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) were designed to remove decay heat through the natural convection of air, but this method has limited cooling capacity and a possible re-criticality accident in case of flooding. To enhance the safety and capacity of dry storage cask of SNF, hybrid heat pipe-based passive cooling device was suggested. Heat pipe is an excellent passive heat transfer device using the principles of both conduction and phase change of the working fluid. The heat pipe containing neutron absorber material, the so-called hybrid heat pipe, is expected to prevent the re-criticality accidents of SNF and to increase the safety margin during interim and long term storage period. Moreover, a hybrid heat pipe with thermoelectric module, a Stirling engine and a phase change material tank {{can be used for}} utilization of the waste heat as heat-transfer medium. Located at the guide tube or instrumentation tube, hybrid heat pipe can remove decay heat from inside the sealed metal cask to outside, decreasing fuel rod temperature. In this paper, a 2 -step analysis was performed using computational fluid dynamics code to evaluate the heat and fluid flow inside a cask, which consisted of a single spent fuel assembly simulation and a full-scope dry cask simulation. For a normal dry storage cask, the maximum fuel temperature is 290. 0 °C.
