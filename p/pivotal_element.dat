50|$|Because {{concern for}} the {{environment}} is now a <b>pivotal</b> <b>element</b> in consumer decision-making, studies have found that the demand for green brands is higher than ever before (Ahmad & Thyagaraj, n.d.). A number of studies have also suggested that such a demand for greener products is due to consumers’ self-expressive benefits. When supporting green brands, customers believe this determines their role in society and as stated by Ahmad and Thyagaraj (n.d.), this gives consumers satisfaction that they are perceived as having an eco-friendly attitude. Various components have been stipulated as effects on conscious consumer behavior such as changing perspectives, awareness of environmental issues and greener products, and people’s perceived environmental contribution in society. Such factors help green brands to segment, define and target their market (Baker, 2003).|$|E

Moreover, we conducted a large scale coexpression analysis by integrating the data with previously generated gene expression profiles of organs and tissues at different developmental stages to obtain a global view of gene networks associated with plant response to nutrient deficiency.|$|R

5000|$|The city of Columbus began {{development}} in 1812 {{with the purpose}} of being the state's new capital. Originally laid out by Lucas Sullivant as the town of Franklinton, the original settlement lay west of the Scioto River. However, Sullivant laid out plans to expand east of the river for what we now know as downtown Columbus. Development began quickly and by 1814 significant buildings included a penitentiary, the first school, the statehouse, the first newspaper, and the first church. By 1816, Columbus was incorporated as an official town, and in 1824 Columbus became the official seat of the county and elected its first mayor, John Brooks, in 1834 after being elevated to [...] "city" [...] status.
