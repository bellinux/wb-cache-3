From the TGA, polyoxazole (PBO) has the highest thermal stability of the four fibers as it is stable up to ca. 500 °C.

The acpom(280) correlated significantly with the concentration of suspended particulate matter and was highest in the bottom water of turbidity maximum zone. Absorption spectral slope (S 275 _ 295) and slope ratio (SR) correlated positively with salinity for both CPOM and CDOM, suggesting decreases in the average molecular weight with increasing salinity. The adsorption of CDOM to re-suspended sediments (at 500 mg L- 1) within 2 h was equivalent to 4 - 26 % of the initial amom(280). The adsorption of CDOM to particles was less selective with respect to various CDOM constituents, while the microbial degradation resulted decreases in S 275 - 295 and SR of CDOM and preferential removal of protein-like components.

40|$|The arid and {{semi-arid}} drylands of {{the world}} are increasingly recognized for their role in the terrestrial net carbon dioxide (CO) uptake, which depends largely on plant litter decomposition and the subsequent release of CO back to the atmosphere. Observed decomposition rates in drylands are higher than predictions by biogeochemical models, which are traditionally based on microbial (biotic) degradation enabled by precipitation as the main mechanism of litter decomposition. Consequently, recent research in drylands has focused on abiotic mechanisms, mainly <b>photochemical</b> and thermal <b>degradation,</b> but they only partly explain litter decomposition under dry conditions, suggesting the operation of an additional mechanism. Here we show that in the absence of precipitation, absorption of dew and water vapor by litter in the field enables microbial degradation at night. By experimentally manipulating solar irradiance and nighttime air humidity, we estimated that most of the litter CO efflux and decay occurring in the dry season was due to nighttime microbial degradation, with considerable additional contributions from <b>photochemical</b> and thermal <b>degradation</b> during the daytime. In a complementary study, at three sites across the Mediterranean Basin, litter CO efflux was largely explained by litter moisture driving microbial degradation and ultraviolet radiation driving photodegradation.

It is based on field physicochemical analyses on cloud samples, and on laboratory irradiation experiments to estimate photochemical reactivity. The first part of results is a characterisation of the different kind of clouds sampled which shows strong oceanic (west flux with high Na+ proportion and pH near 5. 5) and anthropogenic influences (north-east flux with high NO 3 - proportion and pH near 3. 5). The second part concerns the photochemical sources of HO* radicals in cloud aqueous phase; iron species and H 2 O 2. Iron shows a very low reactivity in natural samples and under laboratory irradiation with a speciation of 70 % in its reduced form. H 2 O 2 is mainly produced in gaseous phase and constitute, with its photolysis, an aqueous source of HO* radicals in cloud aqueous phase where its concentration are clearly lowered by anthropogenic influence. Then, in a third part, comparison of microbiological and <b>photochemical</b> <b>degradations</b> (with HO* generated by H 2 O 2 photolysis) are carried out in a laboratory common experimental setting. These experiences show similar kinetics and rates of organic compounds degradation. In a fourth part degradation of 13 carboxylic acids and 2 aldehydes (major organic compounds of cloud aqueous phase) by HO* radicals were analysed to highlight degradation products. These experiments allowed us to establish a global scheme of these degradation pathways more precise than those in the literature. At last, a fifth part clearly proves secondary photochemical production of small chain carboxylic acids in cloud aqueous phase. These observations are compared with field data that show similar tendencies.

The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristic was measured by biasing the sample only for the measuring periods. The capacitance transients were measured without averaging, and DLTS signal was simulated by analyzing the data. The 8 -shaped curves near room temperature in the electrical response of the junction to the excitation signal show there is some nonlinear effect. The C-V measured in pulsed mode can be fitted with a single charge distribution step profile, {{in contrast to the}} C-V measured with a continuos bias, indicating a slow charging during bias. The capacitance transients depend on the number of decays averaged, indicating again a charging process not measured by DLTS.
