2500|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>pasta</b> {{can also}} be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually {{produced}} in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. <b>Dried</b> <b>pasta</b> is mainly shipped over to farther locations and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavour and richness, but are not needed to make <b>dried</b> <b>pasta.</b> In contrast to fresh <b>pasta,</b> <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. <b>Dried</b> <b>pastas</b> are best served in hearty dishes like ragu sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> will usually increase in size by double of its original proportion. Therefore, approximately [...] of <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> serves up to four people.|$|R
40|$|Starch was {{isolated}} and yields and granule size distributions were determined at different steps during industrial pasta production and subsequent high-temperature drying (88 degrees C). The first drying steps rendered the starch granules {{in general and}} the small ones in particular less extractable, possibly due to increased physical inclusion or interaction between starch and gluten components. On the basis of analytical results, starches were divided in a first group containing those withdrawn before the <b>pasta</b> <b>drier</b> and a second group of starches that have undergone partial or complete drying. The latter starches showed higher gelatinization temperatures and viscosities and lower swelling powers and solubilities during gelatinization. It is suggested that the high-temperature <b>pasta</b> <b>drying</b> results in less permeable and thus more rigid starch granules. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{dough is}} then {{ready to be}} shaped into {{different}} types of pasta. Depending {{on the type of}} pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} <b>pasta.</b> The <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; <b>dried</b> <b>pastas</b> are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|R
25|$|Pasta {{exhibits}} a random molecular order {{rather than a}} crystalline structure. The moisture content of <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> is typically around 12%, indicating that <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable.

50|$|The dryer <b>dries</b> the <b>pasta</b> to {{the correct}} {{moisture}} level, typically using sticks or screens to transport pasta inside the dryer depending {{on the length of}} the product. Long goods pasta such as spaghetti is hung vertically from sticks and short goods pasta such as penne is placed on long horizontal conveyors with mesh screen belts. Long goods pasta takes about 6-9 hours to dry depending on the temperature used in the drying process and short goods pasta takes about 3-4 hours. Air circulation, heat and moisture control are critical factors to the <b>pasta</b> <b>drying</b> process.|$|R
40|$|Enrichment of {{durum wheat}} pasta with legume flour enhances their protein and {{essential}} amino acid content, especially lysine content. However, despite its nutritional potential, {{the addition of a}} legume alters the rheological properties of <b>pasta.</b> High temperature <b>drying</b> of <b>pasta</b> reduces this negative effect by strengthening its protein network. The aim of our study was to determine if these changes in pasta structure alter its in vitro carbohydrate digestibility, in vivo glycemic, insulin and satiety responses. We also investigated if high temperature <b>drying</b> of <b>pasta</b> can reduce the well-known digestive discomfort associated with the consumption of legume grains. Fifteen healthy volunteers consumed three test meals: durum wheat <b>pasta</b> <b>dried</b> at a low temperature (control), and pasta enriched with 35 % faba bean dried at a low and at a very high temperature. When enriched with 35 % legume flour, pasta kept its nutritionally valuable low glycemic and insulin index, despite its weaker protein network. Drying 35 % faba bean pasta at a high temperature strengthened its protein network, decreased its in vitro carbohydrate digestion with no further decrease in its in vivo glycemic or insulin index. <b>Drying</b> <b>pasta</b> at a very high temperature reduced digestive discomfort and enhanced self-reported satiety, and was not associated with a modification of energy intake in the following meal...|$|R

40|$|The <b>drying</b> {{process of}} <b>pasta</b> was studied {{following}} an engineering approach. The process was modelled according to mass and heat transfer between dough and air. The modelling starts from a physical {{analysis of the}} process, tacking into account the two main steps governing the phenomenon: mass and heat exchange between pasta samples and air. During <b>pasta</b> <b>drying,</b> the shrinkage can cause the presence of thermal stresses {{that can not be}} relaxed at low water content, when dough behaviour is usually solid-like. The “frozen ” stresses induce breakages inside pasta sample. A stress based rupture criterion was adopted as quality control index and different temperature-humidity profiles were studied. The proposed model was verified using a static dryer. ...|$|R

The external layers of wheat caryopsis, largely constituting by-products of the milling industry such as bran and various middlings, contain relevant amounts of phenolic compounds. The {{aim of the}} research has been to evaluate the effect of supplementation with wheat bran aqueous extracts, obtained by ultrasoundassisted technologies, on the sensory properties and antioxidant activity of <b>dry</b> <b>pasta.</b> The HPLC-DAD characterization of the extract evidenced the presence of ferulic and p-coumaric acids. The supplemented pasta showed significantly higher antioxidant activity and phenolic content than the control, coupled to good overall sensory judgment. In addition, two different <b>pasta</b> <b>drying</b> diagrams were adopted, and the comparison of the corresponding end-products allowed it to be pointed out that the processing technology has to be carefully set up to prevent possible detrimental effects on the antioxidant activity.

40|$|Pasta is a {{traditional}} Italian cereal-based food that is popular worldwide because of its convenience, versatility, sensory and nutritional value. The aim of this review is to present a step-by-step guide to facilitate {{the understanding of the}} most important events that can affect pasta characteristics, directing the reader to the appropriate production steps. Owing to its unique flavor, color, composition and rheological properties, durum wheat semolina is the best raw material for pasta production. Although pasta is traditionally made from only two ingredients, sensory quality and chemical/physical characteristics of the final product may vary greatly. Starting from the same ingredients, {{there are a lot of}} different events in each step of pasta production that can result in the development of varieties of pasta with different characteristics.

40|$|Durum wheat {{semolina}} gluten and starch {{as well as}} processing conditions determine pasta cooking quality. This {{study investigated}} whether, for good organoleptic properties, a permanent protein network needs to be formed during <b>pasta</b> <b>drying</b> or can still be formed during cooking. The cooking quality of 16 spaghetti samples {{was related to the}} levels of sodium dodecyl sulphate extractable protein (SDSEP), starch gelatinisation temperatures {{as well as to the}} swelling properties of milled dry spaghettis. SDSEP levels in dry and cooked products varied between 31 % and 56 %, and 12 % to 21 % of total protein contents, respectively. The highest quality spaghettis had relatively higher levels of SDSEP in the dry product, low starch gelatinisation temperatures and swelling powers, and rigid particles. The lowest quality spaghettis had lower levels of SDSEP and higher gelatinisation temperatures. This work implies that high pasta quality results from an optimal degree of protein polymerisation during drying and/or the subsequent cooking. status: publishe...|$|R
