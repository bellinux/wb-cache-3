40|$|In Thailand, {{there are}} several types of (tangible) {{cultural}} heritages. This work focuses on 3 D modeling of the heritage objects from multi-views images. The images are acquired by using a DSLR camera which costs around $ 1, 500 (camera and lens). Comparing with a 3 D laser scanner, the camera is cheaper and lighter than the 3 D scanner. Hence, the camera is available for public users and convenient for accessing narrow areas. The acquired images consist of various sculptures and architectures in Wat-Pho which is a Buddhist temple located behind the Grand Palace (Bangkok, Thailand). Wat-Pho is known as temple of the reclining Buddha and the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. To compute the 3 D models, a diagram is separated into following steps; Data acquisition, Image matching, Image calibration and orientation, Dense matching and Point cloud processing. For the initial work, small heritages less than 3 meters height are considered for the experimental results. A set of multi-views images of an interested object is used as input data for 3 D modeling. In our experiments, 3 D models are obtained from MICMAC (open source) software developed by IGN, France. The output of 3 D models will be represented by using standard formats of 3 D point clouds and triangulated surfaces such as. <b>ply,.</b> <b>off,.</b> obj, etc. To compute for the efficient 3 D models, post-processing techniques are required for the final results e. g. noise reduction, surface simplification and reconstruction. The reconstructed 3 D models can be provided for public access such as website, DVD, printed materials. The high accurate 3 D models {{can also be used}} as reference data of the heritage objects that must be restored due to deterioration of a lifetime, natural disasters, etc. 1...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quasi-static {{compressive}} {{tests were}} performed on carbon fiber rein-forced polymer (CFRP) circular tubes to examine their axial crushing behaviors. Stable progressive crushing processes with brittle fracturing crushing mode were observed during the experiments. It is found that the crushing triggers including the <b>ply</b> drop <b>off</b> trigger and the shape memory alloy (SMA) trigger introduced in the specimens can efficiently initiate a stable progressive crushing process and sig-nificantly improve the specific energy absorption (SEA) {{as well as the}} crushing load efficiency (CLE) of the specimens. It is important to mention that the SMA trigger provides 37. 2 % increase of the SEA and 28. 0 % increase of the CLE, respectively, as compared with the specimens without a crushing trigger. Moreover, the SEA and the CLE of the composite tubes with the SMA trigger are 22. 8 % and 4. 3 % higher than those of specimens with the <b>ply</b> drop <b>off</b> trigger. In addition, the significant improve-ment of the SEA and the CLE is achieved with only a little increase of the initial peak-specific crushing stress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Composite materials, due {{to their}} unique {{properties}} such as high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and impact resistance have huge potential as structural materials in automotive, construction and transportation applications. However, these properties often come at higher cost owing to complex design methods, difficult manufacturing processes and raw material cost. Traditionally, tapered laminated composite structures are manufactured using autoclave manufacturing process by <b>ply</b> drop <b>off</b> technique. Autoclave manufacturing though very powerful suffers from high capital investment and higher energy consumption. As per the current trends in composite manufacturing, Out of Autoclave (OoA) processes are looked as emerging technologies for manufacturing the structural composite components for aerospace and defense applications. However, {{there is a need}} for improvement among these processes to make them reliable and consistent. In this paper, feasibility of using out of autoclave process to manufacture the variable thickness cantilever beam is discussed. The minimum weight design for the composite beam is obtained using constant stress beam concept by tailoring the thickness of the beam. <b>Ply</b> drop <b>off</b> techniques was used to fabricate the variable thickness beam from glass/epoxy prepregs. Experiments were conducted to measure bending stresses along the span of the cantilever beam at different intervals by applying the concentrated load at the free end. Experimental results showed that the stresses in the bean at different intervals were constant. This proves the ability of OoA process to manufacture the constant stress beam. Finite element model for the constant stress beam was developed using commercial finite element simulation software. It was observed that the simulation results agreed very well with the experimental results and thus validated design and manufacturing approach used...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the final part of a master degree in {{mechanical}} engineering at Luleå University of Technology. The thesis has been performed during autumn 2004 at Volvo Aero Corporation in Trollhättan. The objective is to evaluate and recommend a Finite Element software and analysis process for mechanical analysis in composite materials. Areas of investigation are material properties, preprocessors, solvers and postprocessors. The material properties must be calculated with consideration to the local fiber orientation and thickness of the composite. This can be made inside or outside the preprocessor depending on the software capabilities. In the preprocessing phase is the material oriented towards the geometry. The solver is the number crunching part of the analysis with almost no interference by man {{but it is important}} to have knowledge about the solvers capabilities. In the post processing phase are the results examined and this requires special care for composites due to their failure behavior. The recommended software to use is the preprocessor Patran Laminate Modeler together with the solver Nastran. The recommended working method can be described as a zone based design method where the geometry is divided in zones. These zone divisions are depending on the local loading state, material thicknesses, <b>ply</b> drop <b>offs</b> and geometric location. The working method have been tested and evaluated and have shown to serve satisfactory. Also the FE-software trustworthiness has been tested by comparing a 3 -points bending of a wing profile performed at Sicomp with a similar model in the FE-software. FE-analysis in composite materials is more time consuming than for isotropic materials. The software of today has lack of capabilities for the use of solid elements together with composite materials.

50|$|Borough's {{descriptions}} of Derbent and the neighbourhood {{of the ancient}} city of the fire-worshippers, Baku, are most interesting, as showing, on the one hand, {{the growth of the}} Turkish power, and, on the other, the decadence of the Persian power on the then little-known shores of the Caspian Sea.

50|$|Immediately {{upon her}} return, Wilkes began {{overhaul}} at New York. That occupied her time until 1 May when the destroyer embarked upon her most noteworthy postwar mission—duty as a picket ship {{for the first}} transatlantic flight. Only {{one of the four}} Navy-Curtiss (NC) flying boats slated for the mission actually completed the flight. NC-4 reached the Azores at Horta on 17 May, made the hop to Ponta Delgada on the 20th, and departed the Azores for Lisbon, Portugal, on the 27th. Wilkes served as a picket on that second leg of the flight as the fourth ship in a line of 14 destroyers between the Azores and the European continent. The NC-4 reached her destination that same day, and Wilkes part in the event was completed. While NC-4 finished the third and last leg of its flight—from Lisbon to Plymouth, England—on 30 and 31 May, Wilkes pointed her bow homeward. The destroyer reentered New York harbor on 4 June and resumed peacetime operations along the Atlantic coast. For the next 34 months, she <b>plied</b> the waters <b>off</b> the eastern seaboard in the spring, summer, and fall. Late each fall, she headed south to participate in fleet maneuvers in Cuban waters, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. During that time, she was based at three different ports—Newport, R.I.; New York, N.Y.; and Charleston, S.C. On 12 April 1922, Wilkes entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was placed out of commission on 5 June 1922.|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{approach}} to predict and analyse the effects of moisture ingress on residual stresses in multi-stable composite laminates is developed. Residual stresses are a common consequence of the manufacturing process of composite laminates (e. g. formed thermally, following cool-down from manufacture). Imbalance in these stresses about the mid-plane can lead to warping, and so composite laminates are usually restricted to symmetrical lay-ups. In certain cases, unbalanced residual stresses can be used advantageously, such as in novel morphing structures by use of multi-stable parts. These are parts which feature two or more stable shape configurations, which are obtainable through a force application. With energy only being required to alternate between shapes, multi-stable laminates have been proposed as morphing aerodynamic surfaces for aerospace and wind-energy applications. In these cases (and others in which the laminates are sensitive to residual stresses such as thin plates, <b>ply</b> drop <b>off</b> and bonded repairs) {{a thorough understanding of}} the residual stresses (both as-manufactured and in-service) is required. The residual stresses in fibre-resin composites are known to be sensitive to environmental effects, which can be encountered under in-service conditions. One such effect is moisture absorption, which alters the residual stress state of a laminate through matrix swelling and plasticisation. These changes may lead to a change in the laminate’s shape, {{and in the case of}} multi-stable laminates, a change in the multi-stable behaviour. Applications based upon these unsymmetrical laminates therefore require consideration to moisture effects at a design stage. In this work, a combined numerical/experimental approach is presented whereby the macro-scale through-thickness residual stresses of dry and saturated unsymmetrical composite laminates can be predicted and analysed. A range of unsymmetrical laminates were manufactured from carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (unidirectional continuous fibres pre-impregnated in a polymer-resin matrix), featuring both square cross-ply and tailored (i. e. featuring local variations in lay-up and/or thickness – representative of laminates that would be used in complex applications) laminate configurations. Following manufacture, the dry laminate shapes were measured, with, in the case of the tailored laminates, laser scanning – a full-field, non-contact surface measuring technique. Three-dimensional continuum based finite element models were created (using the software Abaqus) to simulate the thermal deformation of the laminates. The models were benchmarked using analytical approaches, and subsequently calibrated to match the experimentally measured laminate shapes by means of equivalent orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients, negating the need to account for individual residual stress contributors. Subsequently, laminates were immersed in water until saturation, and the change in shape due to matrix swelling was measured. The numerical models were then adapted to take into account moisture induced matrix swelling by use of the analogy between thermal expansion and moisture induced swelling. Subsequently, the variation in shape and residual stress distribution in the laminates following moisture saturation could be analysed. Using laser scanning to measure the tailored laminate shapes allowed for a detailed analysis of the full-field variation between numerically-predicted and experimentally-measured laminate shapes. Using this analysis technique, macro-scale through-thickness residual stress profiles were extracted for each of the cross-ply and tailored laminate configurations. It was found that peak residual stresses can drop by over 70 % following moisture saturation resulting in a significant loss of curvature. Likewise, laminate potential energy can drop by over 90 %, impacting upon the laminates multi-stable behaviour...|$|R
