40|$|The {{efficient}} allocation and use {{of radio}} resources is crucial for achieving the maximum possible throughput and capacity in wireless networks. The conventional strongest signal-based user association in cellular networks generally considers only {{the strength of the}} signal while selecting a BS, and ignores the level of congestion or load at it. As a consequence, some BSs tend to suffer from heavy load, while their adjacent BSs may carry only light load. This load imbalance severely hampers the network from fully utilizing the network capacity and providing fair services to users. In this thesis, we investigate the applicability of the <b>preamble</b> code <b>sequence,</b> which is mainly used for cell identification, as an implicit information indicator for load balancing in cellular networks. By exploiting the high auto-correlation and low cross-correlation property among <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences,</b> we propose distributed load balancing schemes that implicitly obtain information about the load status of BSs, for intelligent association control. This enables the new users to be attached to BSs with relatively low load in the long term, alleviating the problem of non-uniform user distribution and load imbalance across the network. Extensive simulations are performed with various user densities considering throughput fair and resource fair, as the resource allocation policies in each cell. It is observed that significant improvement in minimum throughput and fair user distribution is achieved by employing our proposed schemes, and <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences</b> can be effectively used as a leverage for better cell-site selection from the viewpoint of fairness provisioning.

40|$|Abstract—Error vector {{magnitude}} (EVM) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} accepted figure of merits used to evaluate the quality of communication systems. In the literature, EVM has been related to signalto-noise ratio (SNR) for data-aided receivers, where <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences</b> or pilots are used to measure the EVM, or under the assumption of high SNR values. In this paper, this relation is examined for nondata-aided receivers and is shown to perform poorly, especially for low SNR values or high modulation orders. The EVM for nondata-aided receivers is then evaluated and its value is related to the SNR for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels, and for systems with IQ imbalances. The results show that derived equations can be used to reliably estimate SNR values using EVM measurements that are made based on detected data symbols. Thus, presented work can be quite useful for measurement devices such as vector signal analyzers (VSA), where EVM measurements are readily available.

40|$|Pseudonoise (PN) {{sequences}} {{are widely}} used as <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences</b> to establish timing synchronization in military wireless communication systems. At the receiver, searching and detection techniques, such as the full parallel search (FPS) and the serial search (SS), are usually adopted to acquire correct timing position. However, the synchronization sequence {{has to be very}} long to combat jamming that reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to an extremely low level. In this adverse scenario, the FPS scheme becomes too complex to implement, whereas the SS method suffers from the drawback of long mean acquisition time (MAT). In this paper, a fast timing acquisition method is proposed, using the multilayer synchronization sequence based on cyclical codes. Specifically, the transmitted preamble is the Kronecker product of Bose–Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codewords and PN sequences. At the receiver, the cyclical nature of BCH codes is exploited to test only a part of the entire sequence, resulting in shorter acquisition time. The algorithm is evaluated using the metrics of MAT and detection probability (DP). Theoretical expressions of MAT and DP are derived from the constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) criterion.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, a {{decentralized}} wireless network of separate transmitter-receiver pairs is studied where there is no central controller to assign the resources to the users and users do not explicitly cooperate. For simplicity, we focus on a single-burst scenario where each transmitter sends a single codeword upon activation and remains silent afterwards. Users are block-asynchronous meaning there exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codewords. We show how the receivers learn about the number of active users, channel coefficients and activation times of the transmitters using piecewise linear regression. It is essential that each receiver fi nds the exact arrival time of the codeword sent by its corresponding transmitter. To achieve this goal, <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences</b> are embedded at the beginning of a transmitted codeword. As different users do not necessarily know each other's <b>preamble</b> <b>sequences,</b> there is no guarantee that a receiver can estimate the arrival times of interference bursts along its desired data with vanishingly small probability of error. Nevertheless, the estimates are reliable enough to guarantee successful decoding at each receiver. The second part of the thesis addresses a Gaussian interference channel with two transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) pairs under stochastic data arrival (GIC-SDA). Information bits arrive at the transmitters according to independent and asynchronous Bernoulli processes (Tx-Tx asynchrony). Each information source turns off after generating a given total number of bits. The transmissions are asynchronous (Tx-Rx asynchrony) in the sense that each Tx sends a codeword to its Rx immediately after there are enough bits available in its buffer. Such asynchronous style of transmission is shown to significantly reduce the transmission delay in comparison with the existing Tx-Rx synchronous transmission schemes. The receivers learn about the activity frames of both transmitters by employing sequential joint-typicality detection. As a consequence, the GIC-SDA under Tx-Rx asynchrony is represented by a standard GIC with state known at the receivers. The cardinality of the state space is 2 N_ 1 + 2 N_ 22 N_ 2 in which N_ 1, N_ 2 are the numbers of transmitted codewords by the two transmitters. Each realization of the state imposes two sets of constraints on N_ 1, N_ 2 referred to as the geometric and reliability constraints. In a scenario where the transmitters are only aware of the statistics of Tx-Tx asynchrony, it is shown how one designs N_ 1,N_ 2 to achieve target transmission rates for both users and minimize the probability of unsuccessful decoding. An achievable region is characterized for the codebook rates in a two-user GIC-SDA under the requirements that the transmissions be immediate and the receivers treat interference as noise. This region is described as the union of uncountably many polyhedrons and is in general disconnected and non-convex due to infeasibility of time-sharing. Special attention is given to the symmetric case where closed-form expressions are developed for the achievable codebook rates...|$|R
