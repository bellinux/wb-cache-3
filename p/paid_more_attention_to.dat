5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears {{the marks of}} gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in the {{traditionally}} male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing {{on the details of}} everyday life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1996 at 1:43a.m., Max Cavalera's stepson Dana Wells, {{was killed}} in a car {{accident}} at the age of 21 in Phoenix, Arizona. At the time, Cavalera was the lead vocalist for Sepultura which was on tour promoting its sixth studio album, Roots, in England with Ozzy Osbourne. After hearing the news, Ozzy and his wife Sharon Osbourne hired a private plane to take Cavalera and his wife, manager and mother of Dana, Gloria, back home. After the funeral, Max returned his focus to Sepultura, and the band resumed its European tour. Then, following a sold-out show at London's Brixton Academy on 16 December—later documented on the live album Under a Pale Grey Sky—drummer Igor Cavalera, guitarist Andreas Kisser, and bassist Paulo Jr. told Max they wanted to replace numerous members of the band's staff, including Gloria. Andreas, Paulo and Igor proposed ending the contract with Gloria and hiring a new manager for Sepultura, saying that she <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Max than the band. The trio suggested that she could continue as Max's personal manager but that someone else should manage the band. Gloria refused. Max felt betrayed by his mates, especially his brother.|$|E

25|$|Infants {{as young}} as 1 month {{perceive}} some speech sounds as speech categories (they display categorical perception of speech). For example, the sounds /b/ and /p/ differ {{in the amount of}} breathiness that follows the opening of the lips. Using a computer generated continuum in breathiness between /b/ and /p/, Eimas et al. (1971) showed that English-learning infants <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> differences near the boundary between /b/ and /p/ than to equal-sized differences within the /b/-category or within the /p/-category. Their measure, monitoring infant sucking-rate, became a major experimental method for studying infant speech perception.|$|E
25|$|According to Matković, after 1937 Pavelić <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Ustaše in Yugoslavia than elsewhere, {{since the}} emigrants had become passive after the assassination. In 1938 he {{instructed}} the Ustaše to form stations in Yugoslav towns. The fall of Stojadinović's {{government and the}} creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939 further increased Ustaše activity; they founded Uzdanica (Hope), a savings co-operative. Under Uzdanica, Ustaše founded Ustaše University Headquarters and the illegal association Matija Gubec. However, Pavlowitch observes that Pavelić had few contacts with the Ustaše within Yugoslavia, and that his esteemed position within the Ustaše was partly due to his isolation in Italy.|$|E

25|$|Will Mulcaster {{argued that}} while much {{research}} and creative thought {{has been devoted}} to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect {{it can be seen that}} the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.|$|E
25|$|Membership of {{the various}} Methodist {{branches}} peaked at 841,000 in 1910, then fell steadily to 425,000 in 1990 and only 202,000 in 2014. The {{second half of the}} 19th century saw many of the small schisms reunited to become the United Methodist Free Churches and a further union in 1907 with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought the United Methodist Church into being. In 1908 the major three branches were the Wesleyan Methodists, the Primitive Methodists and the United Methodists. After the late 19th century evangelical approaches to the unchurched were less effective and less used. Methodists <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> their current membership, and less to outreach, while middle-class family size shrank steadily. There were fewer famous preachers or outstanding leaders. The theological change that emphasised the conversion experience as being a one-time lifetime event rather than as a step on the road to perfection lessened the importance of the class meeting and made revivals less meaningful. The growth mechanisms that had worked so well in the expansion phase in the early 19th century were largely discarded, including revivals and the personal appeal to decide for Christ class meetings, as well as the love feast, the Sunday night prayer-meeting, and the open-air meeting. The failure to grow was signaled by the flagging experience of the Sunday schools, whose enrollments fell steadily.|$|E

500|$|Original Stories {{gained a}} {{reputation}} in the 20th century as an oppressively didactic book and was derided by early scholars of children’s literature such as Geoffrey Summerfield. Recent scholars, particularly Mitzi Myers, have re-evaluated Wollstonecraft’s book and 18th-century children’s literature in general, assessing it within its historical context rather than judging it according to modern tastes. Myers suggests, in her series of seminal articles, that women writers of children’s literature such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Maria Edgeworth were not only using the genre of children’s literature to teach but also to promote visions of society distinct {{from those of the}} Romantics. These authors believed that they could effect great change by exposing young children to their ideas of a better society, even though they were [...] "only" [...] writing stories about seemingly insignificant topics such as small animals or little girls. Myers argues that because scholars have traditionally <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Romantic poetry and prose (the works of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example) than to children’s literature, they have missed the social critique that these women writers of children’s literature were offering.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{extensive}} use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. Field tests showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing. In 1999, Anderson {{and a team of}} researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored. They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> unfamiliar material, and because it was more cognitively demanding to understand and solve the problems presented. After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions. Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them. Repetition, which the researchers called [...] "an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension," [...] improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation. Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were [...] "positively enthusiastic" [...] about it. Nielsen ratings of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time. Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings and called it a success.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} possible ground explosion on a shallow-buried metro tunnel, this paper attempts to analyze the dynamic responses of the operating metro tunnel in soft soil, using a widely applied explicit dynamic nonlinear finite element software ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The blast induced wave propagation in the soil and the tunnel, and the von Mises effective stress and acceleration of the tunnel lining were presented, {{and the safety of}} the tunnel lining was evaluated based on the failure criterion. Besides, the parametric study of the soil was also carried out. The numerical results indicate that {{the upper part of the}} tunnel lining cross-section with directions ranging from 0 ° to 22. 5 ° and horizontal distances 0 to 7 m away from the explosive center are the vulnerable areas, and the metro tunnel might be safe when tunnel depth is more than 7 m and TNT charge on the ground is no more than 500 kg, and the selection of soil parameters should be <b>paid</b> <b>more</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> conduct a <b>more</b> precise analysis...|$|R
