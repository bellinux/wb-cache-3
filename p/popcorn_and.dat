5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the <b>Popcorn,</b> <b>and</b> the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E

Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} had to {{move the}} filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due {{to changes in the}} tides at that time of year. Similar to the previous episode, the spaceship was computer-generated. The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing <b>popcorn</b> <b>and</b> packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing <b>popcorn</b> <b>and</b> other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E

50|$|Stewart's wilt can be {{a serious}} disease of many corn types, including: sweet, dent, flint, flower, <b>and</b> <b>popcorn.</b> Sweet corn <b>and</b> <b>popcorn</b> cultivars are more {{susceptible}} to Stewart's wilt than field (dent) corn, but some dent corn inbreds and hybrids are susceptible.

25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} heating {{effect of a}} high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was <b>popcorn,</b> <b>and</b> the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E
