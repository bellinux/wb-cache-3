Native gray ant has beneficial role in peach orchards Kent M. Daane o Jeffrey W. Dlott The effectiveness of resident in-sect predators as biological con-trol agents of <b>peach</b> twig <b>borer</b> was tested in a series of field ex-periments. Results showed that the native gray ant was the most common and effective generalist predator. Treatments with native gray ant present had significantly lower <b>peach</b> twig <b>borer</b> abundance and <b>peach</b> shoot damage. Ant population densities were studied in seven commercial orchards. Results showed that although this ant is found in most peach and nectarine orchards, its abundance was not clearly associated with any single cultural practice and may be difficult to manipulate. Ants are common generalist predators in landscape and agricultural systems. Nevertheless, most ant species are known as orchard pests because they feed directly on the crop or disrupt biological control. For example, the southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, damages almond nuts on the ground. Other ant species have mutualistic as-sociations with honeydew-producing insect pests. The Argentine ant, Linepitkema kumile, ”tends ” aphids for the carbohydrate-rich honeydew the aphids excrete. In return, the ants at-tack parasites and predators of the aphids. Nevertheless, not all ant spe-cies are always orchard pests. This ar-ticle presents results from studies in peach and nectarine orchards that highlight the beneficial role of the na-tive gray ant, Formica aerata, in the con-trol of the <b>peach</b> twig <b>borer</b> (PTB), Anarsia lineatella.

The results of monitoring the development of larval stages over time and the accumulated degree-days from biofix show that the pest develops five generations per year, one of which undergoes a diapause.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{strategies}} to cultural management.

Prune trees appropriately and at the correct time when buds start to break to promote wide angled branching. Infection at pruning sites is less common when done during late spring because of the smaller amount of inoculum present at this time. Inspect trees occasionally and removed any dead branches to prevent infection at these sites. Training trees properly also helps foster decreased amount of disease. Training trees during the first season to have branches develop wide crotch angles to sustain long orchard life. Avoid excessive and late fertilization during cold season to avoid low temperature injury. Fertilize trees during the early spring to prevent cold-susceptible growth.|$|R

Winter removal of unharvested almonds to fewer than two per tree reduced navel orangeworm infestations in both treatments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the trends and {{regional}} patterns of organophosphate (OP) use in California almond orchards from 1992 to 2000, and to identify factors that may have influenced those trends, including weather, pest pressure, and use of alternative practices to control pests. Background Growers use OP pesticides to control arthropod pests in almonds. An OP may be applied to dormant orchards during the winter (called a dormant OP spray). These dormant OPs are usually applied with a narrow-range oil, which is added to improve the effectiveness of the OP and because the oil itself kills some arthropods by suffocating them. Dormant OPs with oils are used primarily to control <b>peach</b> twig <b>borer</b> (PTB), San Jose scale (SJS), European red mite, and brown mite. Dormant sprays have traditionally been considered the most effective way to control all these pests. Applications during the winter are considered less disruptive to non-target organisms, such as natural enemies, than applications during the spring and summer since most organisms are less active during the winter. Thus, in the past a dormant OP spray was routinely applied. However, recen...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of Gelechiidae is {{described}} as Anarsia innoxiella sp. n., based on differences in morphology and biology. It {{is closely related to}} and has hitherto been confused with the <b>Peach</b> Twig <b>Borer,</b> Anarsia lineatella Zeller, 1839. Whereas larvae of the latter feed on – and are known to be a pest of – Prunus species (Rosaceae), the larva of A. innoxiella feeds on Acer species (Sapindaceae). All known synonyms of A. lineatella are discussed in detail, including Anarsia lineatella subsp. heratella Amsel, 1967, from Afghanistan and A. lineatella subsp. tauricella Amsel, 1967, from Turkey.

These traps attracted 8 Microlepidoptera species: Phyllonorycter blancardella, P. corylifoliella, Anarsia lineatella, Eupoecilia ambiguella, Lobesia botrana, Grapholita funebrana, G. molesta and Cydia pomonella. We examined the trapping data {{of these species}} {{in the context of}} lunar phases and polarized moonlight. Catches of the European Vine Moth (Lobesia botrana) and the Codling Moth (Cydia pomonella) were higher in the First Quarter, whereas catches of <b>Peach</b> Twig <b>Borer</b> (Anarsia lineatella), Vine Moth (Eupoecilia ambiguella), Plum Fruit Moth (Grapholita funebrana) and Oriental Fruit Moth (Grapholita molesta) were larger in the Last Quarter. Catches of the other two species, the Spotted Tentiform Leafminer (Phyllonorycter blancardella) and Hawthorn Red Midget Moth (P. corylifoliella), were higher in both the First and Last Quarters. When using pheromone traps, insects do not fly to a light source, so moonlight does not modify either the catching distance or flight activity.

40|$|Abstract A {{new type}} of {{dispenser}} for slow-release of sex pheromones and other semiochemicals was developed based on sol–gel polymers that can be useful for monitoring, mass trapping, and mating disruption in integrated pest management (IPM). Sol–gel matrices exhibit glass characteristics and allow control {{of the degree of}} crosslinking during the polymerization process in order to provide an optimal release rate for a particular pheromone. The advantages of sol–gel (silica) matrixes include keeping the added molecules chemically stable and enabling the sol–gel material to be applied in any desired thickness and pheromone quantity, and thereby readily modify release rates. In addition, sol–gels are primarily silica and water that are common in the environment and therefore safe for field dispensing. We developed a method for the entrapment of pheromones in sol–gel matrices that allowed release at an almost constant rate over many days in the field. For example, 2. 5 mg (E) - 5 -decenyl acetate pheromone of <b>peach</b> twig <b>borer,</b> Anarsia lineatella, entrapped in various sol–gel formulations released 14 – 45 lg/day for up to 28 days. The codling moth (Cydia pomonella) pheromone in sol–gels was used in field tests to capture more codling moth males than unbaited control traps. We describe how the method may be modified to entrap other types of pheromones by making sol–gels with different pore sizes...|$|R
40|$|Mosquitoes hear wingbeat sounds with antennal Johnston’s organs. In males, their {{sensitivity}} {{is thought}} to be enhanced by long fibrils on the antennae; males of many species erect these fibrils before they swarm with females. I investigated the anatomy and acoustic properties of antennae of male and female Aedes togoi, a species whose males erect these long fibrils before swarming. Many moths also hear, but several species that communicate with wingbeat sound have no tympanal organs, sensitive ears thought to have evolved in moths to detect the ultrasonic echolocation of bats. I therefore investigated potential ears in three species known to use sounds, tympanate Indianmeal moths, Plodia interpunctella (IMM) and atympanate <b>peach</b> twig <b>borers,</b> Anarsia lineatella (PTB), and webbing clothes moths, Tineola bisselliella (WCM). These investigations used microscopy, laser vibrometry and electrophysiology. Male and female A. togoi antennae vibrate best at 385 and 252 Hz, respectively, males near the female wingbeat frequency (wbf) of 306 Hz; females are unlikely to hear male wbfs of 523 Hz. In contrast, both sexes of IMM had wbfs near 50 Hz, with associated synchronous ultrasonic clicks spanning 25 - 80 kHz. Male tympana vibrated best at 90 kHz, females at 70 kHz, whereas the antennae of both sexes vibrated best near 150 Hz, the 3 rd harmonic of their wbf. Similarly, both sexes of PTB had wbfs near 56 Hz, with associated ultrasonic clicks spanning 25 - 80 kHz. Their antennae vibrated in response to wingbeat sound, and an air-backed circular area on the metepisternite of both sexes vibrated best at 90 kHz but did not meet all the criteria for an ear. Finally, male WCM had a wbf of 58 Hz but females never flew or fluttered. Male and female antennae vibrated in response to the wbf and had a best frequency at 100 Hz, near the 2 nd harmonic of the wbf. I conclude that these moths, like mosquitoes, have mechanically resonant antennae sensitive to sounds. Like many other flies and bees, the moths may use their antennae to detect wbfs. Because they have little acoustical effect, I suggest a different function for fibrils of male mosquitoes...|$|R

The project goal is a better knowledge of the phytossanitary problems that affect apples, bananas, chestnut and vineyards, applying methods that will contribute to solutions based on the survey of key pests, diseases and beneficial organisms. In the three fruit crops and vineyards analyzed, the methodology used was mainly direct observation of predefined parts of each plant (such as leaves and flowers) on which pests might be expected to occur. The key pest C. capitata was monitored as adults using sexual lures in a net of traps around the island of “Terceira” up to 200 meters altitude. The beneficial insect survey was conducted using the beating technique. For diseases, a direct sampling was carried out by the observation of 10 % of the plants in each orchard or vineyard plot looking for visible symptoms. In apples and vineyards, flowers and branches were collected and tested for microorganisms using serologic and molecular techniques (Elisa and PCR). In banana plantations, the most damaging pests were banana weevil, thrips and a fungi complex that causes symptoms similar to Fusarium wilt. In chestnut, the pest that causes the most severe damage, affecting around 40 % of the nuts produced, is the Chestnut tortrix, but there were some difficulties in identifying which of the three known species was present in the Azores islands. In vineyards, diseases that are most frequent and important include grapevine downy mildew, powdery mildew and Botrytis. Invertebrate pests included grape leafhoppers, thrips and eriophyid mites. The European vine moth was also surveyed but none were found and is still not present. In apple orchards the most important problems were thrips, mites, oriental fruit moth and codling moth.
