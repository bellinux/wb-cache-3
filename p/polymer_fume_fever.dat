50|$|Diagnosis is {{primarily}} anecdotal, that is, {{it depends upon}} a good occupational history. Diagnosis of metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> can be easily missed because the complaints are non-specific, resemble {{a number of other}} common illnesses, and presentation occurs typically 1-4 days after the exposure. When respiratory symptoms are prominent, metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> may be confused with acute bronchitis or pneumonia. The diagnosis is based primarily upon a history of exposure to metal oxide fumes. Cain and Fletcher (2010) report a case of metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> that was diagnosed only by taking a full occupational history and by close collaboration between primary and secondary health care personnel.|$|R
50|$|While PTFE {{is stable}} and {{nontoxic}} at lower temperatures, {{it begins to}} deteriorate after the temperature of cookware reaches about 260 C, and decomposes above 350 C.

50|$|When pans are {{overheated}} beyond approximately 350 °C (660 °F) the PTFE coating {{begins to}} dissociate, releasing byproducts (PFOA) {{which can cause}} <b>polymer</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> in humans and can be lethal to birds. Concerns have been raised over the possible negative effects of using PTFE-coated cooking pans.|$|E

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> involves rapid {{adaptation to the}} development of the syndrome following repeated metal oxide exposure. Workers with a history of recurrent metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> often develop a tolerance to the fumes. This tolerance, however, is transient, and only persists through the work week. After a weekend hiatus, the tolerance has usually disappeared. This phenomenon of tolerance is what led to the name [...] "Monday Fever".|$|R

50|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> or {{fluoropolymer}} fever, also informally called Teflon flu, is an inhalation fever {{caused by}} the fumes released when polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, known under the trade name Teflon) reaches temperatures of 300 °C (572 °F) to 450 °C (842 °F). When PTFE is heated above 450 °C the pyrolysis products are different and inhalation may cause acute lung injury. Symptoms are flu-like (chills, headaches and fevers) with chest tightness and mild cough. Onset occurs about 4 to 8 hours after exposure to the pyrolysis products of PTFE. A high {{white blood cell count}} may be seen and chest x-ray findings are usually minimal.|$|E

Parenteral polymer disintegration involves hydrolytic, redox, and degradation reactions. Accumulative toxicity of plasticizers, antioxidants, and monomers liber-ated from plastic containers warrants investiga-tion. Main problems with heart-assist devices are clothng and blood destruction; with plasma ex-tenders, thesa urismotic reactions; with acrylic bone glues, transitory hypotension; with artificial kidneys, loss of metabolic essentials; with silicone heart valves, uptake of lipids; with silicone chin implants, bone resorption; and with liquid silicone mammary amplification, lumpy breasts and mas-titis.

40|$|Index words: Blood {{copper and}} zinc levels, metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever)</b> Objective To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} exposure to metal dusts, fumes and high temperature levels among brass workers in comparison to a control group. Study design Analytical cross-sectional study. Methodology One hundred and fifty four brass workers were matched for age with 154 controls selected from the local population. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to determine the presence of acute and chronic symptoms and metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b> Haemoglobin and blood zinc and copper levels were measured using the cyanmethaemoglobin technique and atomic absorption spectrophotometry respectively. Thermal environmental measurements were carried out by determining wet bulb and globe temperature (WBGT) levels and air velocity. Results Among the chronic symptoms anorexia (OR = 3. 3), distaste (OR = 8. 3), and aches and pains (OR = 4. 0) were significantly higher in the study group. Among the acute symptoms at work, cough (OR = 4. 2), dry nose (OR = 6. 8), tearing (OR = 6. 3), and itchy eyes (OR = 6. 3) were significantly higher in the study group. Sweating was significantly higher in the control group. Metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> was significantly higher among the study group with an OR of 7. 6. Levels of both copper and zinc were significantly higher in the study group, although both median and mean values were lower than the normal reference ranges. The recommended WBGT level of 26. 1 0 C for an air velocity of less than 1. 53 m/s for heavy work was exceeded only in two workshops.

50|$|Metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever,</b> {{also known}} as brass founders' ague, brass shakes, zinc shakes, galvie flu, metal dust fever, Welding Shivers, or Monday morning fever, is an illness {{primarily}} caused by exposure to chemicals such as zinc oxide (ZnO), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), or magnesium oxide (MgO) which are produced as byproducts in the fumes that result when certain metals are heated. Other common sources are fuming silver, gold, platinum, chromium (from stainless steel), nickel, arsenic, manganese, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, selenium, and zinc.|$|R
5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b> For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|R
40|$|Ultra ne {{particles}} (less than 100 nm in diameter) are {{encountered in}} ambient air {{and at the}} workplace. Normal background levels in the urban atmosphere for ultra ne particles {{are in the range}} 1 { 4 £ 104 cm¡ 3; however, their mass concentration is nor-mally not greater than 2 m g m¡ 3. At the workplace, ultra ne particles occur regularly in metal <b>fumes</b> and <b>polymer</b> <b>fumes,</b> both of which can induce acute in®ammatory responses in the lung upon inhalation. Although ultra ne particles occurring at the workplace are not representative, and, therefore, are not relevant for urban atmo-spheric particles, their use in toxicological studies can give valuable information on principles of the toxicity of ultra ne particles. Studies in rats using ultra ne <b>polymer</b> <b>fumes</b> of polytetra®uoroethylene (PTFE) (count median diameter ca. 18 nm) showed that (i) they induced very high pulmonary toxicity and lethality in rats after 15 min of inhalation at 50 m g m¡ 3; (ii) ageing of PTFE fumes resulted in agglomeration to larger particles and loss of toxicity; (iii) repeated pre-exposure for very short periods protected against the toxic and lethal e¬ects of a subsequent 15 min exposure; (iv) rapid translocation of PTFE particles occurred to epithelial, interstitial and endothe...|$|R
25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is extremely}} {{detrimental to the}} lungs, and pulmonary exposure to zinc chloride smoke resulted in ten fatalities. Inhalation of fumes of zinc, zinc oxide, or zinc chloride leads to pulmonary edema and metal <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b> Onset occurs within 4–6 h and may be delayed up to 8 h. Symptoms include rapid breathing, dyspnea, cough, fever, shivering, sweating, chest and leg pain, myalgias, fatigue, metallic taste, salivation, thirst, and leukocytosis, which can last from 24 to 48 h. In cases of fume inhalation, cortisone preparations should be applied immediately (e.g., by inhalation of Auxiloson) to avoid development of lung edema.|$|R
50|$|Exposure usually arises through hot {{metalworking}} processes, such as smelting {{and casting}} of zinc alloys, welding of galvanized metals, brazing, or soldering. If the metal concerned is particularly high-risk, the residue from cold sanding processes may also cause <b>fume</b> <b>fever,</b> {{even if the}} dose is lower. It may also be caused by electroplated surfaces or metal-rich anti-corrosion paint, such as cadmium passivated steel or zinc chromate primer on aluminium aircraft parts. Exposure has also been reported in use of lead-free ammunition, by the harder steel core stripping excess metal from the jacket of the bullet and barrel of the rifle.|$|R
40|$|Metal <b>Fume</b> <b>Fever</b> (MFF) is a {{constellation}} of influenza-like signs and symptoms, commonly occurring in workers operating galvanizing processes and welders.
