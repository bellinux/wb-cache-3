50|$|Paint <b>Protection</b> <b>Film</b> (PPF) is a {{thermoplastic}} urethane film {{applied to}} painted surfaces {{of a new}} or used car {{in order to protect}} the paint from stone chips, bug splatters, and minor abrasions. This film is also used on airplanes, RVs, cell phones, electronics, screens, motorcycles and many other areas. Paint <b>Protection</b> <b>Film</b> is OEM approved by virtually all car manufacturers.

40|$|The {{fellowship}} {{experience for}} this summer for 2004 pertains to carbon nanotube coatings for various space-related applications. They involve the following projects: (a) EMI <b>protection</b> <b>films</b> from HiPco-polymers, and (b) Thermal protection nanosilica materials. EMI <b>protection</b> <b>films</b> are targeted to be eventually applied onto casings of laptop computers. These coatings are composites of electrically-conductive SWNTs and compatible polymers. The substrate polymer will be polycarbonate, since computer housings are typically made of carbon composites {{of this type}} of polymer. A new experimental copolymer was used last year to generate electrically-conductive and thermal films with HiPco at 50 / 50 wt/wt composition. This {{will be one of the}} possible formulations. Reference films will be base polycarbonate and neat HiPco onto polycarbonate films. Other coating materials that will be tried will be based on HiPco composites with commercial enamels (polyurethane, acrylic, polyester), which could be compatible with the polycarbonate substrate. Nanosilica fibers are planned for possible use as thermal protection tiles on the shuttle orbiter. Right now, microscale silica is used. Going to the nanoscale will increase the surface-volume-per-unit-area of radiative heat dissipation. Nanoscale carbon fibers/nanotubes can be used as templates for the generation of nanosilica. A sol-gel operation is employed for this purpose...|$|R

30|$|We ascribe the {{differences}} between measured and simulated temperatures to the inaccuracy of the numerical model. We have not included the casing of the sensor boards or the <b>protection</b> <b>films</b> in the numerical simulation, as the dimensions of those parts are at or below {{the size of the}} grid cells. They affect not only the thermal properties of the TSM but also the position of the sensors. Those parts influence the apparent thermal conductivities and, due to their fabrication, cause displacement of the sensors from ideal cylindrical coordinates. The displacement of a sensor by 3.2  mm, which corresponds to the cell size of the model, causes a temperature change of up to 0.2  K in the numerical simulation.|$|R

A {{few of the}} major brands that produce these [...] "kits" [...] include 3M, Turtle Wax, Sylvania, Headlight Wizard, Meguiar's, Mothers, and Rain-X.

Some kits include a UV sealant which is said to protect {{the lens of the}} headlight longer. Kits with the UV sealant include some of the 3M, Sylvania, and Headlight Wizard. It should be noted that typically the DIY sealant requires regular periodic reapplication and is not equivalent to the original OEM hardcoat applied during manufacturing. Another common option to delay the aging process of headlight lenses, is the use of press and snap-on headlight covers, or laminates with adhesives that can be applied over the headlight lenses, such as Paint <b>Protection</b> <b>Film</b> sold by 3M.|$|E

According to Kathy Lam, marketing manager for the automotive division of 3M “The first films were thicker and less compliant, because their purpose was to help keep helicopter blades from eroding in the harsh, sandy environments to which they were exposed. Because the blades were flatter and less complex than automotive surfaces, they didn’t demand a highly flexible, conformable film.” ...|$|R
