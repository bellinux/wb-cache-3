25|$|A huge {{variety of}} marine {{invertebrates}} {{are found in}} Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef {{an important source of}} this diversity. Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The crown-of-thorns starfish usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species <b>purple</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{waste and}} debris have greatly {{increased}} in the marine environment during the past 50 years. Not only do these plastics entangle and get ingested by marine mammals, turtles, and sea birds, but they also leach chemicals, such as bisphenol-A (BPA) and styrene into the aquatic environment. While some of these chemicals {{are known to be}} toxic, few studies have examined their effects on broadcast spawning marine invertebrates, specifically at environmentally relevant concentrations. <b>Purple</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from the central coast of California, were utilized to examine effects of BPA and styrene on fertilization success and early development of resulting embryos. Previous research has demonstrated that BPA and styrene decrease successful fertilization and delay development of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> though no previous studies have examined effects of continuous chemical treatment on S. purpuratus development. We exposed eggs, sperm, or both to environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA or styrene (100 µg/L, 500 µg/L, and 1000 µg/L) to test the hypothesis that continuous treatment would lead to developmental abnormalities.

40|$|Ocean {{warming and}} ocean acidification, both {{consequences}} of anthropogenic production of CO 2, will combine {{to influence the}} physiological performance of many species in the marine environment. In this study, we used an integrative approach to forecast the impact of future ocean conditions on larval <b>purple</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) from the northeast Pacific Ocean. In laboratory experiments that simulated ocean warming and ocean acidification, we examined larval development, skeletal growth, metabolism and patterns of gene expression using an orthogonal comparison of two temperature (13 °C and 18 °C) and pCO 2 (400 and 1100 µatm) conditions. Simultaneous exposure to increased temperature and pCO 2 significantly reduced larval metabolism and triggered a widespread downregulation of histone encoding genes. pCO 2 but not temperature impaired skeletal growth and reduced {{the expression of a}} major spicule matrix protein, suggesting that skeletal growth will not be further inhibited by ocean warming. Importantly, shifts in skeletal growth were not associated with developmental delay. Collectively, our results indicate that global change variables will have additive effects that exceed thresholds for optimized physiological performance in this keystone marine species...|$|R

40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleOcean {{acidification}} (OA) {{is expected}} to indirectly impact biota living in contaminated coastal environments by altering the bioavailability and potentially toxicity of many pH-sensitive metals. Here, we show that OA (pH 7. 71; pCO 2 1480 [*]μatm) significantly increases the toxicity responses to a global coastal contaminant (copper ~ 0. 1 [*]μM) in two keystone benthic species; mussels (Mytilus edulis) and <b>purple</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (Paracentrotus lividus). Mussels showed an extracellular acidosis in response to OA and copper individually which was enhanced during combined exposure. In contrast, urchins maintained extracellular fluid pH under OA by accumulating bicarbonate but exhibited a slight alkalosis in response to copper either alone or with OA. Importantly, copper-induced damage to DNA and lipids was significantly greater under OA compared to control conditions (pH 8. 14; pCO 2 470 [*]μatm) for both species. However, this increase in DNA-damage was four times lower in urchins than mussels, suggesting that internal acid-base regulation in urchins may substantially moderate {{the magnitude of this}} OA-induced copper toxicity effect. Thus, changes in metal toxicity under OA may not purely be driven by metal speciation in seawater and may be far more diverse than either single-stressor or single-species studies indicate. This has important implications for future environmental management strategies. CL was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) UK Fellowship: NE/G 014728 / 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Presentation date: 1974 - 12 - 20 During {{the summers}} of 1970 and 1971 {{a total of}} 95 sea otter (Enhydra lutris) were shipped to Oregon from Amchitka Island, Alaska. The 1970 {{shipment}} consisted of 31 otter which were to be released on the southern Oregon Coast {{near the town of}} Port Orford. Two of these animals died in holding pens and 29 were successfully released to the wild on 18 July 1970. A second shipment of 64 sea otter was divided into two groups. On 24 June 1971, 24 otter were released at Port Orford and 40 more were released near Cape Arago. Total documented mortality of the translocated sea otter consisted of eight animals, seven of these were found within 1 week of the releases. During the study period reports of sea otter were distributed from Tillamook Head to Brookings, Oregon, a distance of approximately 276 miles. A single report was received from Tolvana Beach, Oregon, 181 miles north of the nearest release site. Concentrations of otter were established at two locations during 1972, Simpson and Blanco reefs. The number of animals that could. be observed at either of these sites seemed {{to be related to the}} season, with most otter using Simpson Reef during the winter months, subsequently moving to Blanco Reef 35 miles to the south as the weather subsided. The use patterns for 1972 - 73 were similar to those for 1971 - 72; however, the number of otter using Simpson Reef during the winter of 1972 - 73 was less than for the previous winter, suggesting that a portion of the herd may have remained in the vicinity of Cape Blanco during winter 1972 - 73. It is estimated that 30 - 35 sea otter were on the coast at the termination of this study (5 October 1973). The first sea otter pup was sighted on 20 February 1972, 19 months after the 1970 release at Port Orford. Subsequently nine more pups were observed during the study period: three in 1972 and six in 1973. Data on food habits were gathered at Simpson Reef. <b>Sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (Strongylocentrotus spp.) comprised the major portion of the sea otter's diet and accounted for nearly 64 percent of the total number of observations. Mollusks accounted for 14. 4 percent and several species of crabs comprised 5. 2 percent. Underwater surveys of 13 areas indicate that <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> are the most abundant macroinvertebrates normally preyed upon by sea otter. They occur at densities of up to 47 <b>purple</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (S. purpuratus) per 0. 25 m 2, with red <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (S. franciscanus) occurring as high as an estimated six to eight animals per 1 m 2. Results of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the Oregon coastline is suitable for sea otter habitation; approximately 80 percent of the suitable area is situated along the south coast from Coos Bay to the Oregon-California border, with the remainder in the central region near the town of Newport. Both sites chosen for the translocations contain good sea otter habitat; however, because of greater probability of human-related mortality and environmental pollution and the lesser amount of contiguous sea otter habitat in the vicinity of Cape Arago than near Port Orford; the latter appears to have been the better site. It is suggested that in the future, translocated sea otter be tagged to facilitate their identification. Recommended management of the translocated otter in Oregon includes establishment of refuges, protection of the otter and their habitat, and periodic shoreline and aerial surveys to ascertain population growth and range expansion...|$|R
40|$|The intertidal, <b>purple</b> tipped <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> {Psammechinus miliaris) {{was exposed}} to artificially acidified {{seawater}} treatments (pHw 6. 16, 6. 63. 7. 44) {{over a period of}} 8 days. 100 % mortality was reached at pHw 6. 16 after 7 days due to a build up of pC 02 in the coelomic fluid resulting in irrecoverable acidosis. Coelomic fluid acid-base status measures showed an accumulation of PCO 2 and a significant reduction in pH in all treatments compared with controls. Bicarbonate buffering was employed in all cases to reduce acidosis but compensation was unsuccessful even under moderate hypercapnia. Significant test dissolution was evident due to increases in magnesium ions under all pH treatments. The test is however, not thought to be a major source of bicarbonate ions for compensation. Results suggest that a reduction of surface water pH of below 7. 5 would be severely detrimental to the acid-base balance of this intertidal species of echinoid; despite its ability to tolerate fluctuations in carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCOi) and pH in the rock pool environment. A lack of respiratory pigment, poor capacity for ionic regulation and dependency on a magnesian calcite test make both intertidal and non-intertidal echinoids vulnerable to anthropogenic acidification. Geological sequestration leaks may result in dramatic localised pH reductions e. g. pH 5. 8. P. miliaris is intolerant of pH 6. 16 seawater and significant mortality is seen at pH 6. 63. These results indicate that potential future CO 2 storage leaks would result in reduced survival of adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> populations.
