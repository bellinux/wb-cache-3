40|$|This report {{presents}} the <b>primary</b> <b>development</b> process of an innovative milk foamer. The project is structured as the <b>primary</b> <b>development</b> {{process that is}} used at Electrolux Floor Care and Small Appliances AB, Global <b>Primary</b> <b>Development</b> and Innovation department in Stockholm, Sweden. The aim {{was to develop a}} milk foamer with innovative solutions to provide Electrolux with a unique product. The objective was to create a product that highly meets customer requirements and in the same time is feasible to develop into a selling product. All the aspects regarding a consumer product had to be considered. To create innovative solutions thorough investigations of the physics behind foaming and foam are studied and documented. The difference in foam quality when using different ways of foaming is documented and possible explanations is discussed. The <b>primary</b> <b>development</b> process range from pre-study and customer research to designing prototypes and verifications. Most of the report deals with standalone solutions {{but there is also a}} part of the report that deals with integrated solutions and cooperating solutions that would be used together with espresso machines. The result is a variety of concepts and four fully working standalone prototypes. Two prototypes are further developed and are highly interesting to Electrolux...|$|R
