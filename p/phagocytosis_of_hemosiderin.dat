40|$|THE nosological {{position}} of that lesion occurring in and about joint surfaces and designated variously as " xanthoma of the tendon sheath ", " localized villonodular synovitis ", " benign giant cell synovioma ", and " giant cell tumor of tendon sheath " remains disputed. The lesion {{consists of a}} proliferation of polyhedral and spindle cells in a fibrous stroma, exhibiting a capacity for <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> and lipid and a proclivity to form multinucleated giant cells. Opinions differ as to its pathogenesis and biological potential, the real schism occurring in regard {{to whether or not}} it is a neoplastic or a reactive process. Some writers (Jaffe, 1958; Jaffe, Lichtenstein and Sutro, 1941) point to the benign behaviour and phagocytic capacity of the component cells in human material, as indicative of a reactive process, while others, noting the rare tendency to recurrence following excision and the occasional occurrence of superficial erosion of adjacent bone (Fletcher and Horn, 1951), have considered it to be a neoplasm with an unpredictable degree of malignant potential. The lesion is not uncommon in human material, but very few well documented cases have been described in domestic animals (Cotchin, 1954; Nielsen, 1952). During a study of tumors in the Syrian hamster (Kirkman, 1957; 1962; Kirkman and Algard, in press) instances of giant cell tumor arising in dense connective tissue around metacarpal joints were encountered. In a preliminary report of hamster tumors (Kirkman, 1962) these were listed, but not discussed, as synoviomas, with an incidence of 0 03 % in 7200 hamsters. Both were transplantable, but only one had metastasized (lungs and kidneys). Since then a third extraskeletal giant cell neoplasm, of unknown origin, has been observed in what was assumed to be an enlarged, discolored, bronchial lymph node. These three lesions resembled anatomically the giant cell tumors of tendon sheath occurring in humans and it was thought that an account of them might be of value in elucidating the nature of that perplexing lesion...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivePerioperative {{stroke and}} periventricular leukomalacia have been {{reported}} to occur commonly in infants with congenital heart disease. We aimed to determine the incidence and type of brain injury in infants undergoing 2 -ventricle repair in infancy and to determine risk factors associated with such injury. MethodsForty-eight infants enrolled in a trial comparing 2 different hematocrits during surgical repair of congenital heart disease underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and neurodevelopmental testing at 1 year of age. ResultsEighteen (38 %) of our subjects had tiny foci <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> by susceptibility imaging, without evidence of abnormalities in corresponding regions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Subjects with foci <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> had a significantly lower Psychomotor Developmental Index at 1 year of age (79. 6 ± 16. 5, mean ± standard deviation) compared with subjects without these foci (89. 5 ± 15. 3; P =. 04). Older age at surgery and diagnostic group were significantly associated with the presence <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> foci. Only 1 subject had a small stroke (2 %), and 2 subjects had periventricular leukomalacia (4 %). ConclusionFoci <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> without radiologic evidence of ischemic brain injury are an abnormality associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome not previously described in magnetic resonance imaging studies of children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease. The association <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> foci with older age at surgery and cardiac diagnosis, and not with risk factors associated with brain injury, in previous studies suggests that the cause and pathogenesis of this abnormality are different from ischemic brain lesions reported previously...|$|R

5000|$|Hemosiderin or haemosiderin is an iron-storage complex.

40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to clarify the}} mechanism of the storage iron metabolism. A new program of serum ferritin kinetics was applied for studying the increasing and decreasing phases <b>of</b> ferritin and <b>hemosiderin</b> iron in iron addition and removal in patients with a normal level of iron stores or iron overload. The change of ferritin iron in response to iron addition and removal was rapid in the initial stage, but it was slow later. In contrast, the change <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> iron was slow in the initial stage, but it became rapid later. These changes <b>of</b> ferritin and <b>hemosiderin</b> iron suggest that the turnover of ferritin iron is preferential to that <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> iron, and that the initially existed ferritin iron is gradually replaced by the ferritin iron recovered by taking iron from hemosiderin in iron mobilization. The crossing of the increasing curves <b>of</b> ferritin and <b>hemosiderin</b> iron in iron addition indicates a switching of the principal storage iron from ferritin to hemosiderin. The crossing point shifted toward a higher storage iron level in the increase of iron deposition. Iron storing capacity can be increased {{not only by the}} transformation <b>of</b> ferritin into <b>hemosiderin,</b> but also by the expansion of cell space as seen by hepatomegaly in hereditary hemochromatosis. The amounts <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> iron exceeded ferritin iron in all 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C even though they had normal storage iron levels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether a single episode of {{traumatic}} subarach-noid hemorrhage (tSAH) could cause superficial siderosis of the central nervous system (SS-CNS). This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Thirty-two patients with a history of a single episode of tSAH were enrolled in the study. An episode of tSAH was con-firmed in patients based on a CT scan or a lumbar puncture, and a follow-up examination was conducted at least six weeks after the brain trauma. A follow-up MRI examination was performed, using enhanced gradient echo T 2 star-weighted angiography (ESWAN) to detect hemosiderin deposition on the cortical surface.

However <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> zymosan or inert latex beads had little or no effect on CAT expression. Enhancement of HIV LTR CAT expression was dependent upon intact NF-KB binding sites and was independent of tumour necrosis factor alpha secretion.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} to study {{changes in the}} {{metabolism}} of RES in vivo under anesthesia {{over a long period}} a series of experimental observations were conducted with dogs by means of Glycyrrhizin (59) Fe-colloid method and the following results were obtained. 1. It was found that to the dog under anesthesia the <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> the RES is clearly inhibited, and with the use of Isozole it is slightly inhibited, while deep anesthesia such as combination anesthesia and low body temperature anesthesia distinctly affects the phagocytic function of the RES. 2. On the other hand, {{in the study of the}} hemoglobin synthesis which reflects the metabolic function of the RES, by means of fractionation of hermin iron and non-hemin iron in erythrocytes it was demonstrated that the hemoglobin synthesis is clearly inhibited by anesthesia and deep anesthesia inhibits the synthesis to a greater extent. 3. Simultaneous observations of the total organic iron, hemosiderin, ferritin fractions revealed that under anesthesia the retension <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> is increased, ferritin is decreased, and the ratio <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> to ferritin is lessened, suggesting that there develops a retension phenomenon in the RES. 4. The metabolic function of the RES is markedly inhibited by the low body temperature anesthesia at 27 ℃ to 28 ℃ but along with the lapse of time there develops an adaptation-recovery phenomenon and the metabolic function is inhibited more markedly rather than phagocytosis but it does not reach the stage of arresting the reaction. These findings clearly demonstrate that the Glycyrrhizin (59) Fe colloid method is a superior one for examining the functions of the RES to the classical method available. Further, in the investigation of the RES by this method it has been suggested that the function of RES is less inhibited by shallow anesthesia while by the deep anesthesia its inhibition is greater, and that under the low body temperature anesthesia more of the primeval function of the RES is maintained, thus rendering many useful criteria of clinical importancs...|$|R

Macrophages plated on coverslips derivatized with anti-BSA IgG or with human gamma-globulin lost the capacity to phagocytose unopsonized P. aeruginosa, unopsonized zymosan, and EIgG but bound C 3 bi-coated erythrocytes normally. Each of the four human IgG subclasses and Fc fragments of anti-BSA IgG inhibited <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> both unopsonized P. aeruginosa and EIgG. <b>Phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> P. aeruginosa and zymosan was markedly impaired and EIgG minimally inhibited if macrophages were plated on coverslips derivatized with mannan or when mannan {{was added to the}} <b>phagocytosis</b> buffer. <b>Phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> P. aeruginosa and zymosan, and binding of EC 3 bi was dependent on the presence of divalent cations, but <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> EIgG was not.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Superficial siderosis is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by toxic accumulation <b>of</b> <b>hemosiderin</b> {{on the surface of}} the brain and spinal cord for which there is no known effective treatment. Methods—Oral deferiprone, a lipid-soluble iron chelator with ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day was tested for safety in an open pilot study in 10 subjects with superficial siderosis. Results—Over a 90 -day period, deferiprone had no significant adverse effects on hematologic, liver, or neurological function. Ad hoc MRI assessments of the brain indicated a reduction in hemosiderin deposition in some subjects. Conclusions—Deferiprone proved safe in this small population of superficial siderosis subjects.

FSL- 1 markedly enhanced <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> E. coli more strongly than that of S. aureus, but did not enhance <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> latex beads. FSL- 1 stimulation resulted in enhanced <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria by macrophages from TLR 2 +/+mice but not those from TLR 2 -/- mice.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with DC-SIGN and MSR 1 phagocytosed these bacteria. These results suggest that the FSL- 1 -induced enhancement <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria by acrophages may be explained partially by the upregulation of scavenger receptors and the C-type lectins through TLR 2 -mediated signaling pathways and that TLR 2 by itself does not function as a phagocytic receptor...|$|R

Definitive evidence for activation of PLD by M. tuberculosis was provided by markedly increased generation of the PLD- specific product phosphatidylethanol (PEt) (9. 9 -fold increases in [3 H]- PEt for both Erdman and H 37 Ra strains compared to control, P < 0. 001, n = 12), {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 % ethanol. <b>Phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> opsonized zymosan (OZ), which is also mediated by CRs, was similarly associated with activation of PLD (12. 2 -fold increase in PEt, P < 0. 001, n = 12). The competitive PLD inhibitor 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -DPG) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of PLD activity stimulated by either M. tuberculosis (- 78 +/- 8 %) or OZ (- 73 +/- 6 %). Inhibition of PLD by 2, 3 -DPG was associated with concentration-dependent reductions in <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis (- 74 +/- 4 %) and OZ (- 68 +/- 5 %). Addition of purified PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus to 2, 3 -DPG- treated macrophages restored <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis to control levels. Inhibition of M. tuberculosis- or OZ-stimulated PA generation by ethanol was associated with concentration-dependent reductions in <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> both particles. Incubation of MDMs with either Erdman or H 37 Ra M. tuberculosis, or OZ, resulted in rapid (onset 1 min) and sustained (60 min) increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of multiple MDM proteins. Prominent Tyr-P was noted in proteins of 150, 95, 72, 56, and 42 kD.

Regardless of the isolation method, GM-CSF-derived macrophages (GM-MQ) stained positive for CD 206 and M-CSF-derived macrophages (M-MQ) for CD 163. THP- 1 cells did not express CD 206 or CD 163 following incubation with PMA, M- or GM-CSF alone or in combination. Upon infection with Lm, all primary macrophages showed good survival at high multiplicities of infection whereas viability of THP- 1 was severely reduced even at lower bacterial numbers. M-MQ generally showed high <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Lm. Strikingly, <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Lm by GM-MQ was markedly influenced by the method used for isolation of monocytes. GM-MQ derived from negatively isolated monocytes showed low <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Lm whereas GM-MQ generated from positively selected monocytes displayed high <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Lm. Moreover, incubation with CD 14 antibody was sufficient to enhance <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Lm by GM-MQ generated from negatively isolated monocytes. By contrast, non-specific <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> latex beads by GM-MQ was not influenced by treatment with CD 14 antibody. Furthermore, phagocytosis o...|$|R
40|$|An {{inflammation}} of the airway of patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), is characterized by dense neutrophil infiltration. Resolution of the inflammation {{can be achieved by}} the removal of apoptotic neutrophils by human alveolar macrophages (AM) without liberating neutrophil proteases in the airway. To understand clinical efficacy for the treatment of DPB by 14 - or 15 -member macrolides, their effects on the <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic neutrophils by AM were examined. Treatment of AM with erythromycin (ERY) or clarithromycin at clinically achievable levels significantly increased the levels <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic neutrophils. A serum factor was not essential for the enhancement by these 14 -member macrolides. Of the antibiotics tested, these effects were specific for the 14 -member macrolides and a 15 -member macrolide, azithromycin, but not for the 16 -member macrolides, clindamycin or β-lactam antibiotics. The enhanced <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic neutrophils by ERY had no effect on the levels of interleukin- 8 or tumor necrosis factor alpha production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated AM after <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> the apoptotic neutrophils. The increased <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic neutrophils by ERY was also found to be phosphatidylserine receptor-dependent for AM. These data indicate a novel anti-inflammatory action of 14 -member and 15 -member macrolides, and suggest that such antibiotics achieve clinical efficacy for patients with DPB, in part, through enhancing the nonphlogistic <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic neutrophils by AM...|$|R
40|$|The antigen-presenting and {{accessory}} functions of monocytes were studied after <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria. Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from mononuclear cells by counterflow elutriation were incubated with suspensions of opsonized bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Salmonella enteritidis) under {{conditions in which}} at least 80 % of the monocytes engulfed microorganisms. Either the cells were pulsed with antigen (purified derivative of tuberculin or tetanus toxoid) and used as antigen-presenting cells for autologous T lymphocytes or the accessory function of the cells was examined in pokeweed mitogen-activated cultures of T cells. It {{has been found that}} <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria by monocytes reduces their ability to trigger antigen- and mitogen-induced proliferation. The reduced proliferative response of T lymphocytes was not due to a change of the kinetics of the response or triggering of suppressor mechanisms. Furthermore, antigen processing was not affected much after <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria since antigen-pulsed and paraformaldehyde-fixed cells containing bacteria were comparable to control cells in their antigen-presenting capacity. This phenomenon was observed after <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> both living and dead bacteria and was not correlated to the viability of monocytes, which were more affected after <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> living bacteria than of dead ones. As a result <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria, reduced expression of CD 54, CD 14, and HLA-DQ, variable reduction of HLA-DP, CD 58, and CD 64, and reduced viability of monocytes wer...|$|R

We {{assessed the}} effect of iC 3 b opsonization upon <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic Jurkat cells by macrophages, which were differentiated from THP- 1 cells by treatment with retinoic acid. Macrophage <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic Jurkat cells was enhanced upon incubation of the apoptotic cells with normal human serum.

40|$|When <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus aureus {{by human}} {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes (PMN) {{takes place on}} the surface of cultured human endothelial cells, the endothelial monolayers are damaged by lysosomal enzymes that are released by the PMN. Because PMN can phagocytose opsonized as well as unopsonized staphylococci on an endothelial surface, we studied the role of bacterial opsonization in the damage caused to the endothelium. <b>Phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> unopsonized S. aureus was accompanied by greater damage (expressed as the percentage of the endothelial cells detached from the culture plates) of the monolayers than was <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> opsonized S. aureus: 52 +/- 10 % and 24 +/- 7 %, respectively, after 30 min <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis</b> and 73 +/- 5 % and 50 +/- 6 %, respectively, after 60 min <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis.</b> When correlated to the amount <b>of</b> <b>phagocytosis,</b> this difference was even greater (uptake was 35 +/- 4 % for unopsonized S. aureus and 56 +/- 5 % for opsonized S. aureus after 30 min and 42 +/- 3 % and 60 +/- 5 %, respectively, after 60 min). Total release of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase and generation of superoxide anion were the same during <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> opsonized or unopsonized staphylococci. Adherence of PMN to the endothelial cells was greater during <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> unopsonized S. aureus: 42 +/- 4 % verus 27 +/- 3 % during <b>phagocytosis</b> <b>of</b> opsonized staphylococci. Possibly, increased adherence of the PMN resulted in a locally higher concentration of enzymes which induced more damage. We conclude that opsonization of bacteria not only improves bacterial uptake, but also protects bystander cells from damage by the phagocytosing PMN...|$|R
