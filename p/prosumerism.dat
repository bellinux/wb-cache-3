40|$|The Prosumer Complex’ regards <b>prosumerism</b> {{as a new}} {{productive}} mode {{of online}} image work. <b>Prosumerism,</b> I claim, recuperates practical elements of artistic practice and looking as labour, and puts these {{to work in a}} new kind of viewing. As prosumers we are discouraged from assessing the function of our viewing, the nature and outcomes of our production. On websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram we ‘share’ personal images as a form of interplay on prosumer platforms that claim to enable communion, communication and creative freedom for users. In this thesis, I regard the recent history and changing meaning of the term ‘prosumerism’, the new industry of images it has created and how its recent critiques relate to theories of the capitalist recuperation of artistic labour. I outline specific film and performance works by artists Mark Leckey, Frances Stark and Ericka Beckman and analyse how they probe, dramatise and disturb the activity of <b>prosumerism.</b> The intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of <b>prosumerism</b> are played out within the work and thus become reflexive, showing the social and economic conditions in which they are produced and performing the exhibitionary tendencies those conditions create. These reflexive works elicit a more complicated and differentiated mode of viewing than the uniform regard <b>prosumerism</b> encourages. They provide unique models for exhibition making that expose a common contemporary subjectivity with a voracious, growing appetite for images as well as its relationship to productive display platforms for and from which these images are produced and consumed. Manipulating and exposing this co-production by implementing the curator’s subjectivity and agonist display architectures, ‘The Prosumer Complex’ becomes a curatorial form of ‘détournement’ where the exhibition visitor sees <b>prosumerism</b> at work within the exhibition’s elements. Thus the prosumer complex becomes a mode of reflexive curating and an affective advance from prosumer critique...|$|E
40|$|The {{focal point}} of this thesis is on whether and how digital {{practices}} can challenge and reintroduce values and concepts related to self-awareness and spatial sensitivity. It uses prosuming practices of food and social media as a research and learning tool. Prosumption is a compound word formed by joining the words production and consumption and, in brief, it means producing for one’s own consumption. This study is conducted {{in the area of}} digital media and architecture. The main architectural interest lies in the way that place (and notions related to the private and public spheres) is perceived by its users and how this experience can be affected by prosuming social media platforms every day. In particular, this study explores if and how digital media, especially the prosuming of social media content, alters preestablished issues related to spatial sensitivity. A thorough critical examination of the prevailing views on these topics, as well as their evolution in time, is described. The present status of the matters studied is approached by a literature review and an empirical study using mainly phenomenological methods of approach. Food prosuming is explored first and the conclusions reached, related to self awareness and spatial sensitivity, are then further tested and attempts are then made to apply these to social media content prosuming. The research methods used involved in-depth interviews with 35 participants over a period of two years. Individuals who covered a spectrum of different ages, social groups and professional categories were selected for interview. Data relating to the documentation of prosuming practices of the participants, questionnaires, and personal reflections through blogging and social media practices were recorded. Furthermore, one intervention of public prosuming activity was also investigated. As it was found in food <b>prosumerism,</b> there is a significant difference if practiced occasionally and when practiced in the frame of habitual everydayness. This differentiation can be related to and affect issues such as privacy and the personal and social spheres. It was also found that while casual prosuming in the digital domain of social media involves aspects and values of the public domain, everydayness transforms these digital prosuming practices into familiar practices as they are habituated in the private domain. Schematically, this can be represented as: Public → Casual → Private. Everyday digital <b>prosumerism</b> cultivates and incorporates issues of the private domain, whereas by definition it should incorporate issues of the social domain. This is what in this thesis is referred to as issues of the public-private domain. This remark, though, affects the essence of spatial sensitivity, the understanding of the private and the social sphere and the values and tendencies involved. Our findings suggest that, in most cases of food prosuming, when sharing, the host aims to instil a specific mood for the event, to be responsible for the setting, the ambience, the atmosphere of the sharing experience with the guests and the facilitation of sharing. In the digital domain, the mood and ambience of the sharing setting might follow the same pattern as is facilitated by the host, {{but at the same time}} the process of sharing sets the mood in an accelerated process; it is co-created, continued or totally altered by the public private sphere. <b>Prosumerism</b> as explored so far is correlated positively to issues of selfactualization and personal wellbeing (Xie, Troye and Bagozzi, 2008). Do digital prosuming practices share the same qualities? Personal atmospheres today, or what we call in this thesis aetherspheres, incorporate values and issues cultivated and fed by the fused atmosphere of the physical and the digital domain, forming a new ethos of <b>prosumerism</b> and crafting new norms...|$|E
40|$|Can {{big data}} make us happy? Social thinker Jeremy Rifkin thinks so — through the {{digitized}} global network the Internet of Things (IoT). In The Zero Marginal Cost Society, he posits how people, {{natural resources and}} more “will be linked via sensors and software to the IoT platform, continually feeding Big Data to every node — businesses, homes, vehicles”. Rifkin sees the IoT as allowing economic exchange through a collaborative commons that will eclipse the capitalist marketplace and save the planet. Rifkin {{is known for his}} insight on social and technological trends. Although he does not sufficiently explain how the IoT will reduce environmental problems, the book has many stimulating ideas on everything from bitcoin and <b>prosumerism</b> to the smart economy.

40|$|Findability is a {{pressing}} issue for PSM {{in an environment}} characterised by networked media and communications. This chapter analyses advanced website and network practices used by The Guardian, The Huffington Post, Nesta, and DuckDuckGo to illustrate nuanced approaches to ensure the findability of content on the web in various applications (tablets, smartphones, laptops, etc.). Building on earlier research (Jackson 2014), the author argues {{that the use of}} advanced database-driven platforms within the Internet offer opportunities for tagging content, for personalisation, <b>prosumerism,</b> and the recommending and forwarding of content. All of that increases visibility. Secondly, the author suggests the use of customer-relationship management systems, which enable storing and analysing user preferences. This is also helpful to ensure that PSM content is readily visible. The author is especially concerned about the need for PSM news to be easily findable as an independent high quality alternative to commercial online news aggregators...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{perceptible}} {{need for}} overviews that broadly address media literacy, information literacy and related literacies {{for the last}} half decade, which was characterised {{by the emergence of}} several novel approaches and new concepts that answer the challenges caused by the pervasive presence and profound effect of information technology, especially social media. Therefore, this paper, which is a non-exhaustive (selective) review of the developments in the field, covers the period 2012 and 2016. The topics investigated include media literacy, information literacy and several other literacies in general, as well as social media literacy, news literacy and issues, related to <b>prosumerism,</b> in particular. The relationship between media literacy and information literacy is also examined, adding that the convergence between them resulted in the appearance of media and information literacy. The effects of the new framework for information literacy education in higher education, the theory of curation as an active literacy practice, and the influence of data literacy are examined. Digital literacy and metaliteracy are also characterised...|$|E
40|$|The {{key element}} of Web 2. 0 is what O’Reilly refers to as an ‘architecture of participation’. Taglines such as YouTube’s ‘broadcast {{yourself}} ’ and Lulu’s ‘publish your words, your art – for fun or profit ’ point to the creative empowerment that has accompanied the mass adoption of digital technologies {{and the rise of}} Web 2. 0 applications. Combined with the ‘rip, mix and burn ’ nature of digital technologies, the Web has rapidly become a locus for user-created content, much of which copies, appropriates and mashes up copyrighted materials. The invitation to engage with the media-saturated environment has led to a proliferation of <b>prosumerism</b> through which many consumers have become producers of content. Appropriation and redeployment of copyrighted materials in the prosumption arena has drawn creators and right holders into conflict. Copyright owners seek to maintain control over information flows, whilst prosumers make (what they consider to be) fair uses of elements harvested from the media-saturated environment. This article is concerned with these tensions that – whilst not new – have been exacerbated by Web 2. 0. Specifically, this article addresses the issue of fairness (in the context of the US fair use doctrine) in the digital age and questions whether powerful cultural forces require a reconfiguration of copyright law. Fairness is an elusive concept; in the realm of copyright, an act may simultaneously be decried as piracy and defended as a fair use. Web 2. 0 has fostered a growing prosumer culture that freely appropriates from media sources to give effect to new works, and this article questions whether the customary practices of this emergent culture should impact upon the legal construction of fairness.

40|$|This Deliverable {{specifies}} {{the main}} existing stakeholders involved in legal publication for the BOLD 2020 vision, and their working practices {{with regards to}} the consumption, creation, use and exploitation of legal data. Workstream 1 involves the identification of the problem through a Soft Systems Methodology approach (Annex 1), the mapping of stakeholders and the identification of their understanding of the problem domain, the activities they are engaged in, and the key use cases for the re­use and consumption of legal data. It also maps the flows of data {{as a result of the}} legal, social and market limitations and identifies potential flows of value in the same context. Together with country case studies Deliverables 1. 2. d 1 ­ 5 (four reports based on protocol D 1. 2. d 1), this report will feed into Workstream 2 activities 2. 3 ­ 2. 4, and the “White paper on the OpenLaws. eu open innovation community" (finalized in M 24) to provide an updated set of recommendations based on the overall findings of the OpenLaws. eu project. The report analyses using the standard subtitles for the BOLD 2020 vision: big data, open data and legal data. In Big Data, it explains the term, its impacting by digitalisation, mash­ups, machine­readability, interoperability. Open Data is explored for the use of standards, licences, and the impact of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI) as well as generating of open data by users. Free Data within open data is explored via the Free/Open Source Software movement, the reuse and enhancement of law as a public goods via the history of the Free Access to Law Movement (FALM). Legal Data is analysed within sectors of users including law firms, universities, citizens. The typology of judgements, legislation, regulations, soft law, legal literature is used. We examine consumption patterns, stakeholders, users, and ‘prosumers’. <b>Prosumerism</b> and the law is finally explored, which introduces the concept of the lawyer creating their own sources of law via both authorship and stewardship of online resources...|$|E
40|$|What is good {{sustainable}} innovation policy? And what is {{good governance}} for user-led innovation for more sustainable products and services in specific? The basic aim of innovation policy is to promote invention and innovation that transforms knowledge and competence into long-term social welfare. Innovation policy for sustainable development asks {{what can be done}} by government to support products, processes and social innovations that spur and enable more sustainable lifestyles in specific. From a policy maker’s perspective, there are two basic approaches to innovation policy: Either, governments engage into “horizontal industrial policy”, i. e. they design a supportive legal and economic framework, insure dynamic markets and promote a technology friendly “climate” in society. Or, governments engage in “vertical industrial policy” and opt for more active - and more intruding - efforts to develop an industry or a technology with economic incentives and industry-specific market regulation. This latter option has been criticized by market proponents since “picking the winners” by the state instead of the market is often not very efficient (“market knows best”). On the other hand, it has its merits in speeding up necessary changes in markets. Both approaches are, however, focused on entrepreneurs and industries, hence on the supply side of the market. In times of digitalization, <b>prosumerism</b> and blurring boundaries between supply and demand, another focus is slowly gaining importance, namely user-led innovation for sustainable products and processes. The present report hence focuses on the question how innovation policy can spur this kind of innovation with userentrepreneurs on the demand side of markets in the driver seat. The report identifies the key impact mechanisms as reported and analysed in the relevant literature. While admittedly this type of research is still scarce and in its infancy, we know from traditional innovation policy literature that good innovation governance • is consistent and reliable; • supports interaction between and offers platforms for all relevant actors: market actors (both: supply and demand), political actors, societal actors and science, also between venture capitalists and innovators/entrepreneurs; • designs a supportive innovation infrastructure (education, physical infrastructure, etc.); • supports a social “climate” that is open for innovation and has a culture for innovation and failure (willingness to change, open for new opportunity, trust in whom, culture of risk); • finds the right balance of regulation and free market; and • designs effective incentives and support programmes. This is also the starting point for the present report that focuses on the specific requirements of user-led sustainability innovation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} why women are choosing to sew clothing for themselves as a leisure activity in the age of fast fashion. Resurgence in home sewing participation, specifically an increased interest in personal garment sewing, has prompted the need to explore these women’s perceived benefits and their consumer behavior as they operate outside of typical consumer culture. Due to the lack of current home sewing research, a grounded theory approach was used to reveal the reasons for this phenomenon through the experiences of the female sewers. An ethnically diverse sample of 15 female middle-class home sewers, ages 20 – 40 years from the United States and Canada, were recruited for interviews through Facebook sewing groups. In interviews, the participants were asked questions regarding their reasons for sewing clothing for themselves and the benefits that sewing provided them. Questions were also asked about feelings attached to sewing, the reactions of others, time spent sewing, and sewing-related consumption. The content analysis of the interview data revealed three emergent themes: investment, control, and empowerment. All three emergent themes were interconnected within an overarching central theme of personal fulfilment. The research data revealed that these women’s decisions to sew clothing for themselves offered them personal fulfillment that was not experienced in other aspects of their lives, providing them with a sense of accomplishment, a creative outlet, and stress release. The theme of investment reflected how these women invested in their leisure decision to sew clothing through cognitive, monetary, and time aspects. Control was revealed by the increased power over their appearance that sewing their own clothing allowed them as a consumer and the higher level of self-expression they were able to attain. Empowerment was reflected as the positive impact that sewing participation had on their confidence as well as their increased desire to sew that was impacted by the support and positive feedback of others. To illustrate the interconnectedness and recurring process of the emergent themes around the central theme of personal fulfillment, a model for women’s motivations to sew clothing for themselves was developed. An additional sew or purchase decision model was developed to demonstrate the decision-making process the women used when choosing to sew or to purchase a desired garment. This model depicts the factors in the decision-making process as well as the increased consumption stages an individual goes through in the decision to sew and not purchase. Theoretical perspectives from <b>prosumerism,</b> craft consumer and do-it-yourself consumption, as well as uses and gratification theory were applied to better understand the motivations of these women. In addition, these women’s motivations to sew explored in comparison with third-wave feminist handcraft reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Editorial Welcome to {{this special}} issue of Public Communication Review themed ‘Social Media – Social Organisations – Social Interests’. Much has been said and written about the digital (r) {{evolution}} and the transition from Web 1. 0 to Web 2. 0, particularly the rise of what are widely termed social media. Looking beyond technological determinism and technological transformism that inevitably accompany such developments, scholars are increasingly focussing on the ‘sociology of technology’ – the social changes that both influence and arise from such developments, as well as changes in the practices of media and communication that occur. This issue was created to particularly explore notions of the ‘social organisation’, a concept advanced by Gartner and other business consulting firms which suggest that organisations are becoming more open, interactive, dialogic and responsive to their stakeholders and publics through use of social media. In turn, this suggest that social media and social organisations are more openly recognising and reflecting social interests – rather than being organisation-centric focussed on achievement of their own ‘strategic’ objectives. The potentiality of social media, reflected in discourses of media democratisation, <b>prosumerism,</b> and the global public sphere is much celebrated. Social media ostensibly afford two-way dialogic communication, opportunities for user-generated content, networking and even ‘communication without borders’, according to some papers presented at the 2012 World Public Relations Forum held in Melbourne in the same month as this issue. But what of the reality? Accepting that social media are now recognised {{as part of the}} media environment and the public sphere and need no introduction, this issue focuses particularly on the two perspectives that are highlighted in the theme: how organisations are using and being affected by social media, on one hand, and how social interests are being served through social media – or not – on the other. The new communication environment offers many opportunities for organisations. One is the ability to extend word of mouth communication to what some refer to as ‘word of mouse’ or, more formally, eWOM. Through the internet, the face-to-face limitation of word of mouth is removed and messages that once reached a few can reach millions through social media such as Twitter, causing some to refer to eWOM as word of mouth on steroids. The potential for social media to create and extend positive and negative word of mouth messages, which in turn effect corporate reputation, is explored by Martin Williams, Francis Buttler and Sergio Biggemann in their article ‘Relating word-of-mouth to corporate reputation’. Nevertheless, social media bring challenges to organisations to which they need to adapt, such as expectation of faster response, a breakdown of communication ‘control’ through single authorised spokespersons and PR departments and a shift to widespread online discussion by employees, resulting in calls for governance, as discussed by Anne Linke and Ansgar Zerfass in their examination of current practices among organisations and future trends in Europe. Also, we are pleased to present a review by Suresh Sood of Brian Solis’ new book, The End of Business as Usual. This reflects on changes taking place, the principles of social media communication and how these challenge organisation-centred thinking and traditional public communication practices. On the other side, three articles explore social interests and how these are being served through social media – if indeed they are. Ann Louise de la Poype and Suresh Sood examine the role and uses of social media in the public sphere through the example of the nuclear debate in Post-Fukushima France in their article ‘Public sphere dialogue in online newspapers and social spaces’. From a political communication perspective, Marie Grussel and Lars Nord analyse the use of social media for national elections in Sweden in their article ‘Three attitudes to 140 characters’. These contributions to discussion reflect on whether social media enhance the public sphere and afford citizen voice, or whether it is ‘business as usual’. A further valuable perspective challenges the persistent myth that social media are only for the young. Beyond the world of ‘digital natives’, Daniel Schultheiss examines how ‘silver gamers’ – elderly people – turn to online games for entertainment, stimulation and social interaction – in his article, ‘Entertainment for retirement’. The use of online games by the elderly and their entertainment functions are not trivial. Some health experts suggest that interactive social media and online games can provide stimulation that slows down dementia and other age-related illnesses, as well as providing pleasurable activities for an increasing segment of the population in many societies. We thank the contributing authors and reviewers for their support in producing this special issue and we encourage all scholars in the public communication field to consider Public Communication Review in 2013.
