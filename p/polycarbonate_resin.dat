Selective synthesis of MBT by benzylation of toluene with BC over hierarchical micro-mesoporous-H-ZSM- 5 (modified zeolite) catalyst was systematically studied for the first time. Hierarchical micro-mesoporous composites of H-ZSM- 5 were obtained by treating parent H-ZSM- 5 with different alkali (aq. NaOH) concentration. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area, TPAD, etc. The 100  % BC conversion with 100  % MBT selectivity was obtained over Hier-HZ- 578 (Hierarchical H-ZSM- 5) at lower molar ratio (toluene:BC) of 4 : 1 than 10 : 1 molar ratio reported, so far.

40|$|The {{transient}} response of a 0. 4 by 0. 6 cm rectangular bore rail accelerator was analyzed by a three dimensional finite element code. The copper rail deflected to a peak value of 0. 08 mm in compression and then oscillated at an amplitude of 0. 02 mm. Simultaneously the insulating side wall of glass fabric base, epoxy resin laminate (G- 1 o) was compressed to a peak value of 0. 13 mm and rebounded {{to a steady}} state in extension. Projectile pinch or blowby due to the rail extension or compression, respectively, can be identified by examining the time history of the rail displacement. The effect of blowby was most significant at the side wall characterized by mm size displacement in compression. Dynamic stress calculations indicate that the G- 10 supporting material behind the rail is subjected to over 21 MPa at which the G- 10 could fail if the laminate was not carefully oriented. Results for a <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>resin</b> (Lexan) side wall show much larger displacements and stresses than for G- 10. The tradeoff between the transparency of Lexan and the mechanical strength of G- 10 for sidewall material is obvious.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{of fiber}} reinforcement {{such as high}} modulus graphite to a matrix resin such as polycarbonate is greatly enhanced by applying a very thin layer, suitably from 50 Angstroms to below 1000 Angstroms, {{to the surface of}} the fiber such as by immersing the fiber in a dilute solution of the matrix resin in a volatile solvent followed by draining to remove excess solution and air drying to remove the solvent. The thin layer wets the fiber surface. The very dilute solution of matrix resin is able to impregnate multifilament fibers and the solution evenly flows on{{to the surface of the}} fibers. A thin uniform layer is formed on the surface of the fiber after removal of the solvent. The matrix resin coated fiber is completely wetted by the matrix resin during formation of the composite. Increased adhesion of the resin to the fibers is observed at fracture. At least 65 percent of the surface of the graphite fiber is covered with <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>resin</b> at fracture whereas uncoated fibers have very little matrix resin adhering to their surfaces at fracture and epoxy sized graphite fibers exhibit only slightly higher coverage with matrix resin at fracture.

40|$|Tests using reconstituted samples {{have been}} {{performed}} to assess the diffusive transport of 137 Cs and 60 Co through natural regolith materials from a region in South Australia being considered for a radioactive waste repository. A double diffusion cell apparatus made of <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>resin</b> was developed to estimate the effective diffusion (De) and sorption coefficients (Kd) that allowed large withdrawals from the source and collector cells and has enabled tests with low concentrations of radioactivity. An alternative to porous stainless steel filter plates has also been used to reduce uncertainty in test interpretation. Analysis of the transient data used a staged method of the Laplace transform {{to take into consideration}} the volume of the samples withdrawn from the apparatus during testing. At test completion samples were cut into slices and analysed for radionuclide concentration. Data obtained from the sliced samples confirmed that both numerical and experimental data produced acceptable mass balance. The De values obtained in this study were of the order of 10 − 6 cm 2 s− 1 for both species, higher than previously published data. The Kd values from the diffusion and batch sorption tests were in reasonable agreement for 137 Cs, but an order of magnitude different for 60 Co. The sorption of the latter radionuclide was strongly pH dependent, and this dependency during diffusion tests would benefit from further investigation. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN Experimental construction and validation of a highly specialized dissection station. SETTING Laboratory and international dissection course. METHODS We designed a lightweight dissection station made of <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>resin</b> approved for use with a CO 2 laser. The cylindrical box hosts an articulated laryngeal support. The laryngoscope is positioned on an articulated arm, which is fixed on the construction's footplate. Validation of the larynx box was performed during an international dissection course on laryngeal surgery held in January 2016. RESULTS We assessed the suitability of our novel dissection station among specialized laryngologists with a mean experience of 14 years. Feedback from the participants was very positive, with a mean general impression of 9. 5 (out of 10 points) and a recommendation score of 9. 6 for further use. Its utility in transforming the taught surgical steps into daily practice has been highly recognized, with a score of 9. 5. CONCLUSION The lightweight and transparent larynx box is suitable {{for any kind of}} laryngeal specimen, and any surgical intervention can be taught at reasonable cost.

40|$|As {{plastic and}} plastic {{products}} {{are being used}} in day to day {{at the cost of}} environment pollution, the human and wild life health and has become a global concern. Researchers found link between abnormal liver enzymes in the people and Bisphenol-A (BPA). Changes in insulin resistance, reproduction system, cardiovascular and brain function are also reported. BPA is used in the production of epoxy <b>resins,</b> <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>resins,</b> and polyester resins. BPA can leach out of certain plastic products including variety of modern goods, reusable food storage containers, eyeglass lenses, white dental fillings, sealants, medical equipments etc. In the body, BPA behaves as an estrogen receptor agonist and mimics estrogen hormone. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widespread endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) used as the base compound in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics. Children and unborn and new born babies are at high risk of unwanted effects of BPA. Children suffer from chronic exposure to bisphenol A with manifestation of gastrointestinal problems, adrenal stress, immune dysfunction, toxic over load and neurological disorders. Some study in Japan has observed that more BPA can leach from polycarbonate products that have been scratched or is more than 4 years old or used bottles that have been subjected to bottle brushing or dishwashing and sterilization. People exposed to higher levels of BPA due to use of plastic food and beverages containers are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and metabolic disorder. Recent studies have suggested that BPA exposure may have a {{role in the development of}} weight gain, insulin resistance, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, thyroid hormone disruption, and several other mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes. Urinary BPA levels are found to be associated with diabetes mellitus independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. There is a concern of exposure of BPA to pregnant women that can affect the development of offspring in the womb. It is considered that women may be placing their fetuses at the risk by having dental sealants applied during pregnancy. Public should be educated about the use of plastic and plastic products which can prove to be hazardous and risk factor to many health problems of human and wild life.
