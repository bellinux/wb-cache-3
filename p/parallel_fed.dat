40|$|Abstract—Three-phase {{induction}} {{machines are}} today {{a standard for}} industrial electrical drives. Cost, reliability, robustness and maintenance free operation are among the reasons these machines are replacing dc drive systems. The development of power electronics and signal processing systems has eliminated {{one of the greatest}} disadvantages of such ac systems, which is the issue of control. With modern techniques of field oriented vector control, the task of variable speed control of induction machines is no longer a disadvantage. The need to increase system performance, particularly when facing limits on the power ratings of power supplies and semiconductors, motivates the use of phase number other than three, In this paper a novel scheme of connecting two, three phase induction motors in <b>parallel</b> <b>fed</b> by two inverters; viz. VSI and CSI and their vector control is presented. Keywords—Field oriented control, multiphase induction motor, power electronics converter. I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a novel design of an UE (User Equipment) antenna for the 60 -GHz band is presented. The antenna was {{realized}} on LTCC A 6 M-E substrate to ease a later integration with the RF-chipset {{on a single}} module. To satisfy the requirement of a relative bandwidth of 15 % an electrically thick substrate was utilized, which unfortunately leads to an undesired excitation of surface waves. A suppression of these dielectric modes was achieved by employing a cancellation technique of excited surface waves. The proposed antenna consists of two <b>parallel</b> <b>fed</b> aperture coupled microstrip patch antennas. The S-parameter and radiation pattern results (simulation and measurement) are presented and are used to verify the antenna design. The manufactured antenna exhibits a - 10 dB impedance bandwidth of more than 9 GHz, a Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) greater than 60 ° and a realized gain of more than 5. 5 dBi over the bandwidth. © 2017 IEEE...|$|E

The cold side was designed with coiled plate made of stainless steel and water from a chiller circulates through the plate at constant temperature. Measurements will be in steady state and unidirectional flow through the wall. The system has pneumatic electronic mobile units that allow managing wall system samples up to 400 kg weight and up to 30 cm thick walls. The variables to be measured are surface wall temperatures, hot and cold plates, the voltage, and current supply by a power source.

40|$|We discuss an {{original}} {{scheme based on}} distributed feedforward neural networks (NN), aimed at modelling several queueing systems in cascade fed with bursty traffic. For each queueing system, a neural network is trained to anticipate {{the average number of}} waiting packets, the packet loss rate and the coefficient of variation of the packet inter-departure time, given the mean rate, the peak rate and the coefficient of variation of the packet inter-arrival time. The latter serves for the calculation of the coefficient of variation of the cell inter-arrival time of the aggregated traffic which is fed as input to the next NN along the path. The potential of this method was sucessfully illustrated on several single server FIFO queues in (Aussem 99).

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of an amphiphilic copolymer coating on biofilm formation and biofouling control. The coating was composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and perfluorodecyl acrylate (PFA), respectively. Commercial RO membranes were coated with HEMA-PFA copolymer film. Long and short term biofouling studies with coated and uncoated membranes and feed spacer were performed using membrane fouling simulators (MFSs) operated in <b>parallel,</b> <b>fed</b> with water containing nutrients. For the long-term studies pressure drop development in time was monitored and after eight days the MFSs were opened and the accumulated biofilm on the membrane and spacer sheets was quantified and characterized. The presence of the membrane coating was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results showed that the amphiphilic coating (i) delayed biofouling (a lower pressure drop increase by a factor of 3 and a lower accumulated active biomass amount by a factor of 6), (ii) influenced the biofilm composition (23 % lower polysaccharides and 132 % higher protein content) and (iii) was still completely present on the membrane at the end of the biofouling study, showing that the coating was strongly attached to the membrane surface. Using coated membranes and feed spacers in combination with advanced cleaning strategies may be a suitable way to control biofouling...|$|E

All treated sewage reaches fresh water reservoirs as well as gasses escaping from the process are emitted to the atmosphere. Main aim of the thesis is to determine N 2 O emissions from partial nitritation/Anammox (deammonification process) in one-stage system applied in MBBR technology. Whole project was operated successfully on two pilot-scale reactors <b>parallel,</b> <b>fed</b> by the same reject water. Both reactors were filled to capacity of 200 L each, where 40 % of the working volume was fulfilled by Kaldnes carriers suspended in liquid by mechanical stirrer. First reactor (R 1) presented strategy of intermittent aeration with ratio (R= 1 / 3) and stable DO concentration at amount of 1. 5 mg O 2 /L, whereas second one (R 2) operated in constant aeration with variable values of dissolved oxygen which differ in range of 1. 0 - 2. 5 mg O 2 /L. Every week analyses of ammonium and nitrogen forms were carried out in influent and effluent by Hach-Lange cuvettes. Results of measurements showed high NH 4 +-N removal efficiency of approximately 95 % for R 1 reactor and 86 % for R 2. During the process, the continuous measurement of nitrous oxide in gaseous and liquid phase was performed by Teledyne data logger and Unisense microsensor. Measurements during 4 months resulted in assessment of nitrous oxide emission tendency dependent on aeration system. The result from reactor R 1 showed that 1. 0 - 2. 4 % of N-load was emitted as N 2 O to the atmosphere, and 0. 05 - 0. 28 % was released as dissolved N 2 O in outgoing water.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} Round-Robin (RR) routing {{to a system}} of {{parallel}} queues, which serve jobs according to FCFS or preemptive LCFS scheduling disciplines. The cost structure comprises two components: a service fee and a queueing delay related component. With Poisson arrivals, the inter-arrival time to each queue obeys the Erlang distribution.

40|$|In many {{material}} science applications simulations {{are made of}} dozens of sequences, where each sequence groups together eigenproblems with increasing self-consistent cycle outer-iteration index. Successive eigenproblems in a sequence possess {{a high degree of}} correlation. In particular it has been demonstrated that eigenvectors of adjacent eigenproblems become progressively more collinear to each other as the outer-iteration index increases. This result suggests one could use eigenvectors, computed at a certain outer-iteration, as approximate solutions to improve the performance of the eigensolver at the next one. In order to opti- mally exploit the approximate solution, we developed a block iterative eigensolver augmented with a Chebyshev polynomial accelerator (BChFSI). Numerical tests show that, when the sequential version of the solver is fed approximate solutions instead of random vectors, it achieves up to a 5 X speedup. Moreover the parallel shared memory implementation of the algorithm obtains a high level of efficiency up to 80 % of the theoretical peak performance.

When groundwater strains were allowed to challenge the steady-state biofilm developed by inoculated strains, they readily displaced the inoculated strains and further reduced the toluene effluent concentration from 0. 140 to 0. 063 mg/liter for 98 % removal. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of reactor community DNA showed a succession of populations to a pattern that was stable for at least 4 months of operation. <b>Parallel</b> reactors <b>fed</b> toluene and BTX but inoculated directly from groundwater had the same treatment performance and the same ARDRA profiles as each other and as the seeded reactor once the groundwater community took over. Convergence and stability of populations were confirmed by genotype analysis of 120 isolates taken from all reactors and at several times.

Protein digestion in fed stage 3 juveniles is accomplished by cysteine proteinases, but what bioactive compounds attenuate host haemostatic, inflammatory and immunological responses during feeding is unknown. Trypsin inhibitory activity and anticoagulant activity were detected in crude extracts of unfed P. formica stage 1 juveniles; fractionation of stage 1 crude extracts by ion exchange chromatography resulted in 3 preparations each displaying these bioactivities. Further characterization revealed anti-thrombin activity in 2 of these preparations, whilst the third displayed the strongest anticoagulant activity that targeted a factor of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Three trypsin inhibitors (18 kDa, 21 kDa, and 22 kDa) were also detected using reverse zymography.

40|$|Planar {{electromagnetic}} lenses {{like the}} Rotman lens are attractive candidates for beambeam forming networks forming networks {{because of their}} high bandwidth of operation and their capability to form multiple beams at lower cost as comparable electronic phase shifting networks. The principles of Rotman lenses have been studied for several decades and examples have been successfully built using different technologies, including <b>parallel</b> plate cavities <b>fed</b> by rectangular waveguides or microstrip lines on dielectric substrate. Due to the true time delay nature of Rotman lenses they theoretically exhibit extremely large bandwidth. However, lenses with rectangular waveguides as ports suffer from propagation of higher order modes inside the waveguide which limits the bandwidth to less than one octave in practical applications. Higher order waveguides, e. g. single or double ridged waveguides, allow for the propagation of a transversal electromagnetic (EM) mode and thus incorporate a larger bandwidth.

The CC-DF process was not sufficient to mitigate biofouling but the UF membrane was effective in mitigating biofouling on the RO membrane surfaces. Fouling of the UF and RO membranes was dominated by hydrophilic fractions of EfOM (e. g., polysaccharide-like and protein-like substances) and inorganic scaling (e. g., aluminum, calcium and silica). The desorbed UF membrane foulants included more aluminum species and hydrophobic fractions than the desorbed RO membrane foulants, which was presumably due to the residual coagulants and aluminum-humic substance complexes. The {{significant change in the}} surface chemistry of the RO membrane (a decrease in surface charge and an increase in contact angle of the fouled RO membranes) induced by the accumulation of hydrophilic EfOM onto the negatively charged RO membrane surface intensified the fouling formation of the fouled RO membrane by hydrophobic interaction between the humic substances of EfOM with relatively high hydrophobicity and the fouled RO membranes with decreased surface charge and increased contract angle.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for any kind of technology used for DVE landings and takeoffs is to provide an intuitive display and keeping the workload low while providing all the necessary cues to perform the tasks safely and efficiently. Mounting different complementary types of sensors (TV, Infrared (EVS- 1000, Max-Viz, USA), mmW (AI- 130, ICx Radar Systems, Canada) and Ladar (HELLAS-W, EADS, Germany)) with different characteristics onto DLR’s research helicopter FHS (flying helicopter simulator) is the first step to gather information of the surrounding world. The data processing is designed and realized by a high performance sensor co-computer (SCC) cluster architecture, which is installed into the helicopter’s experimental electronic cargo bay. The aim of generating a single comprehensive description of the current outside situation shall be achieved by a sophisticated data fusion concept. Data from the different sensors are collected in <b>parallel</b> and finally <b>fed</b> into that “scene description”, which grows over time. The idea of displaying this information on a helmet mounted display is followed by the Institute of Flight Guidance in the scope of the internal DLR project ALLFlight (Assisted Low Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Sites). The output of the project will result in a broader mission potential of the helicopter compared to the present situation, where it is in common that a mission cannot be performed or has to be canceled due to bad visual conditions. As a preparation of ALLFlight’s flight trials in 2011, a scientist of our institute spent three months during 2010 at the National Research Council (NRC) in Canada to conduct some Bell 205 flight trials with the same mmW radar sensor (AI- 130, ICx Radar Systems, Canada) which is also used within ALLFlight’s sensor suite. A challenge during his habitation was the adaptation of the data interfaces to use the software suite at NRC and DLR. Furthermore, a software application for controlling the radar’s parameters manually and automatically as well as for monitoring the radar has been developed. After a short introduction regarding the motivation of the ALLFlight project, the paper describes data evaluations of mmW radar sensor data recorded within the flight trials at NRC. Advantages and disadvantages of the sensor’s technical characteristics will be pointed out. ...|$|R

[...] et al. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the hepatic manifestation of the {{metabolic}} syndrome, defined by the deposition of fat in more than 5 % of hepatocytes. It {{is well known that}} lipid overload, particularly cholesterol, sensitizes to hepatocellular damage. We were focused to figure out the effect of a high cholesterol diet (HC, 2 % cholesterol and 0. 5 % sodium cholate) in the bile duct ligation (BDL) -induced cholestasis and the involvement of c-Met in the repair process. [Methods]: C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were fed with the HC diet for two days and after that were subject to BDL, <b>parallel</b> animals were <b>fed</b> with regular rodent chow diet (Chow) and BDL was performed. Hepatic enzymes in serum were measured. Western blotting of main survival pathways were analyzed and confocal immunofluorescence for c-Met was performed in primary hepatocytes isolated by the two-step collagenase perfusion. [Results]: Our data show that HC animals were more susceptible to both insults, all animals in the HC-BDL group (n = 6) die during the first 72 h after surgery, while all animals in Chow-BDL (n = 7) were alive. We proceeded to sacrifice animals at 24, 48 and 72 h after BDL of all groups. Liver macroscopic inspection of HC mice showed the characteristic pale color in steatosis and changes in gallbladder. Although AST, ALT and ALP were increased as a consequence of BDL, animals fed with the hypercholesterolemic diet increased significantly these values (ranging from 20 to 200 - fold), these data were in agreement with an elevation on bilirubin, suggesting an exacerbation of cholestatic damage. Examination of the main signaling pathways involved in repair process, such as Akt, Stat 3 and Erk 1 / 2 in HC animals showed a downactivation in Erk 1 / 2 and Akt, but some compensatory effect in Stat 3 was observed. In vitro analysis of c-Met activation by Western blotting and immunofluorescence in hepatocytes from HC animals revealed a delayed activation of this receptor after HGF treatment. In conclusion our data suggest that cholesterol overload in hepatocytes aggravates cholestasis and impairs signaling pathways involved in liver repair as a consequence in c-Met misactivation.
