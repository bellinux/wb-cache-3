40|$|Background: The role {{of support}} {{workers and other}} {{professionals}} in the psychotherapeutic process has been commented upon but not as yet been systematically investigated. Method: To explore their views and expectations of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for adults with intellectual disabilities, eleven paid support workers and <b>professionals</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> and interviewed before the CBT sessions commenced for their service users and nine {{took part in the}} second interview that took place after nine sessions.

Nevertheless, after nine sessions, most participants reported improved psychological well-being for their service users and expressed a wish for longer-term involvement of the therapist. Conclusions: The results suggest that for CBT to be effective in the longer term, the therapist is required to consider a wider systemic approach including staff training and supervision, staff and management consultancy and creating a delicate balance between confidentiality and sharing the psychological formulation with ‘significant others’ to ensure maintenance and generalisation of improved psychological well-being. </p...|$|E
