5000|$|Disabilities is an {{umbrella}} term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment {{is a problem}} in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.

50|$|When {{psychological}} injuries compromise daily activities, psychologists need {{to address}} the degree of disability (see Schultz, 2009; Schultz & Rogers, 2011). Patients express symptoms that might be accurately diagnosed as PTSD, Pain Disorder, and/or TBI. However, the critical issue is the degree of impairment, limitation, and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> in daily activities in which patients would normally participate at work, at home, in childcare, and in schooling. When the patient cannot undertake the functions involved in these important roles, the psychologist or other mental health professional may conclude that a disability is present, but this cannot be ascertained by the mere presence of a diagnosis of one sort or another. Rather, the psychologist must demonstrate that the person is disabled from the essential duties, tasks, or activities of the role at issue. For example, a forefinger injury leading to chronic pain might mean relatively little to an investment banker—as long as medications control it and other areas of functioning are not greatly affected—but might be devastating to a violinist. Psychologists may refer to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (Rondinelli, Genovese, Katz, Mayer, Müller, Ranavaya, & Brigham, 2008) in arriving at disability determinations, which addresses mental health, neuropsychological, and pain issues. However, like the DSM-IV-TR, this compendium is sometimes questioned for its scientific validity and usefulness.|$|E
40|$|Background: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO-ICF) {{describes}} <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> as {{one aspect}} of disability. <b>Participation</b> <b>restriction</b> refers to health problems that can hinder people’s involvement in different life events. It is rational {{to believe that the}} prevalence of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> increases among a frail population. However, information about the level of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> among older people, particularly the pre-frail or frail, remains scant. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the prevalence and underlying risk factors associated with <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> among community-dwelling frail and pre-frail older people. Methods: A cross-section of 299 community-dwelling frail older people with a mean age of 79. 5 participated in this study. They had to have been identified as being either pre-frail or frail based on the five common characteristics of the frailty phenotype. Their level of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> was assessed based on the Chinese Reintegration to Nursing Living Index (C-RNLI). All other independent variables were identified and systematically linked to different components in the WHO-ICF framework. Results: Among all participants, 207 (69. 2 %) were identified as encountering participation restrictions in at least {{one aspect of}} their life, with a mean C-RNLI score of 68. 3 (SD 19. 43). A multivariate regression analysis showed that the participants’ status of frailty, self-perceived social status, level of exhibited depressive mood, sleep quality, mobility, level of fear of falling, and physical activity levels had a significant association with <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> When all of the variables, regardless of significance, were included, the factors together explained 67. 1 % of the variance in the participants’ <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> Conclusion: <b>Participation</b> <b>restriction</b> was prevalent among community-dwelling frail older people and was associated with factors across different components in the WHO-ICF. This finding supports the view that <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> is multifactorial in nature. School of Nursin...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to gain insight into <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> among former Buruli ulcer patients in Ghana and Benin. In this cross-sectional study, former Buruli ulcer patients were interviewed using the Participation Scale, the Buruli Ulcer Functional Limitation Score to measure functional limitations, and the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue to measure perceived stigma. Healthy community controls were also interviewed using the Participation Scale. Trained native interviewers conducted the interviews. Former Buruli ulcer patients were eligible for inclusion if they had been treated between 2005 and 2011, had ended treatment at least 3 months before the interview, and were at least 15 years of age. In total, 143 former Buruli ulcer patients and 106 community controls from Ghana and Benin were included in the study. <b>Participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> were experienced by 67 former patients (median score, 30, IQR; 23; 43) while 76 participated in social life without problems (median score 5, IQR; 2; 9).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{survivors}} of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are ADL-independent, {{but they often}} experience restrictions in (social) activities and, therefore, cannot regain their pre-morbid level of participation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and <b>participation</b> satisfaction experienced after aSAH were assessed. Moreover, possible predictors of participation after aSAH were examined to identify goals for rehabilitation. METHOD: <b>Participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> experienced {{by a series of}} 67 patients visiting our SAH outpatient clinic were assessed as part of standard clinical care using the <b>Participation</b> <b>Restrictions</b> and Satisfaction sections of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation Participation (USER-Participation) 6 months after aSAH. Cognitive impairments, cognitive and emotional complaints, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, assessed 10 weeks after aSAH, were examined as possible predictors of participation by means of linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Although patients were ADL-independent, 64 % reported one or more <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and 60 % were dissatisfied in one or more participation domains. Most commonly experienced restrictions concerned housekeeping, chores in and around the house, and physical exercise. Dissatisfaction was most often reported about outdoor activities, mobility, and work/housekeeping. The main predictors of <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> as well as satisfaction with participation were cognitive complaints (subjective) (β = -. 30, p =. 03 and β = -. 40, p =. 002, respectively) and anxiety (β =. 32, p =. 02 and β = -. 34, p =. 007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Almost two-thirds of the ADL-independent patients experienced problems of participation 6 months after aSAH. Cognitive complaints (subjective) and anxiety symptoms showed the strongest association with <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and satisfaction.

40|$|Psychological {{distress}} is {{a well-known}} complication in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but knowledge regarding emotions {{and their relationship to}} <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> is scarce. The objective {{of the study was to}} explore emotions related to <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> by patients with early RA. In this study, 48 patients with early RA, aged 20 - 63 years, were interviewed about <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> using the critical incident technique. Information from transcribed interviews was converted into dilemmas and linked to International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) participation codes. The emotions described were condensed and categorized. Hopelessness and sadness were described when trying to perform daily activities such as getting up in the mornings and getting dressed, or not being able to perform duties at work. Sadness was experienced in relation to not being able to continue leisure activities or care for children. Examples of fear descriptions were found in relation to deteriorating health and fumble fear, which made the individual withdraw from activities as a result of mistrusting the body. Anger and irritation were described in relation to domestic and employed work but also in social relations where the individual felt unable to continue valued activities. Shame or embarrassment was described when <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> became visible in public. Feelings of grief, aggressiveness, fear, and shame are emotions closely related to <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in everyday life in early RA. Emotions related to disability need to be addressed both in clinical settings in order to optimize rehabilitative multi-professional interventions and in research to achieve further knowledge.

40|$|Background: Apart from {{promoting}} physical {{recovery and}} assisting in {{activities of daily}} living, a major challenge in stroke rehabilitation is to minimize psychosocial morbidity and to promote the reintegration of stroke survivors into their family and community. The identification of key factors influencing long-term outcome are essential in developing more effective rehabilitation measures for reducing stroke-related morbidity. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a theoretical model of predictors of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> which included the direct and indirect effects between psychosocial outcomes, physical outcome, and socio-demographic variables at 12 months after stroke. Methods: Data were collected from 188 stroke survivors at 12 months following their discharge from one of the two rehabilitation hospitals in Hong Kong. The settings included patients' homes and residential care facilities. Path analysis was used to test a hypothesized model of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> at 12 months. Results: The path coefficients show functional ability having the largest direct effect on <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> (β = 0. 51). The results also show that more depressive symptoms (β = - 0. 27), low state self-esteem (β = 0. 20), female gender (β = 0. 13), older age (β = - 0. 11) and living in a residential care facility (β = - 0. 12) have a direct effect on <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> The explanatory variables accounted for 71 % of the variance in explaining <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> at 12 months. Conclusion: Identification of stroke survivors at risk of high levels of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction,</b> depressive symptoms and low self-esteem will assist health professionals to devise appropriate rehabilitation interventions that target improving both physical and psychosocial functioning.

40|$|The {{factors that}} affect {{referral}} for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have been widely studied. Implicit in this work {{is the assumption that}} patient health status should determine priority for surgery. However, specification of patient health status lacks a strong theoretical framework. This study employs the WHO model of health outcomes, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), to examine patient health factors in the referral process for TJA. Within 8 weeks prior to TJA, 260 patients electing for primary TJA completed a questionnaire which measured the ICF (impairment, activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions)</b> and four types of delay in their journey from initial consultation with their primary care physician to surgery. Impairment did not affect any stage of the referral process. In contrast, patients who had experienced a delay of 26 weeks or less between referral to a surgeon and being placed on the waiting list for surgery reported greater activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> than patients who had waited more than 26 weeks. Further, patients who reported having wanted surgery for more than 52 weeks reported greater <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> than patients who had wanted surgery for less than 52 weeks. The ICF identifies three health outcomes, two of which (activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions)</b> are related to delay in the referral process for TJA. The ICF is a useful theoretical framework for the study of factors that influence prioritisation for surgery.

Despite the growing prevalence of arthritis and associated participation restrictions, {{few studies have}} measured the long-term impact {{of the environment and}} psychological factors on <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> in this population. METHODS: Participants from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) self-reported participation at baseline, 30, 60, and 84 months using the Instrumental Role subscale of the Late Life Disability Index. For study 1, participants’ environmental features were assessed at baseline from the Home and Community Environment questionnaire administered in the MOST-Knee Pain & Disability study, an ancillary study of MOST. The relative risk of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> at 60 months due to community mobility barriers and transportation facilitators was calculated using binomial regression, adjusting for covariates. For study 2, baseline levels of positive and negative affect were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The relative risk of incident <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> over 84 months due to 1) low positive affect (vs. high positive affect), 2) high negative affect (vs. low negative affect), and 3) combinations of low/high positive and negative affect (vs. high positive affect/low negative affect) were calculated in separate analyses using binomial regression, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: In study 1, 69 (27 %) of the 322 participants developed <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> by 60 months. Participants reporting high community mobility barriers at baseline had 1. 8 times the risk [95 % CI: 1. 24, 2. 73] of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> at 60 months, after adjusting for covariates, whereas the risk due to high transportation facilitators was not significant. In study 2, 470 participants (26 %) had incident <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> over 7 years. The adjusted relative risks of incident <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> over 7 years across the three analyses were: 1) low positive affect (vs. high positive affect) : RR: 1. 2 [95 % CI: 1. 0, 1. 4], 2) high negative affect (vs. low negative affect) : RR: 1. 5 [95 % CI: 1. 3, 1. 7], 3) low positive affect and high negative affect (vs. high positive and low negative affect) : RR: 1. 8 [95 % CI: 1. 4, 2. 1].

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stroke is not gender-discriminatory. Yet, {{the subject}} of stroke among females has {{apparently}} not received significant attention from clinical researchers. The consequences of stroke include functional and psychosocial sequelae which may cause disability, hinder community reintegration and restrict participation. The inter-relationships among functional ability, community reintegration and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> of community-dwelling, female stroke survivors in Ibadan were assessed in this descriptive study. METHODS: Fifty-two community-dwelling female stroke survivors (mean age = 56. 55 ± 9. 91 years) were surveyed using consecutive sampling technique. Their functional ability level was measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) while London Handicap Scale (LHS) {{was used to assess}} their <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> Data were analyzed using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (rho) and Mann-Whitney U test at p = 0. 05. RESULTS: Significantly positive correlations (p< 0. 05) were found between functional ability and community reintegration (r = 0. 54; p = 0. 01) as well as between <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> and community reintegration (r = 0. 34; p = 0. 05). Individuals with left hemiplegia had significantly higher mean rank scores in functional ability (30. 41) than those who had right hemiplegia (mean rank scores = 21. 94). CONCLUSION: Functional ability which appears to be related to stroke laterality showed positive association with both community reintegration and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> This suggests that improving the functional ability of the stroke survivors may reduce <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> and enhance their reintegration into the community.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} the frequency of participation 6 months poststroke compared with prestroke; and to establish whether the change is associated with <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and satisfaction with participation 6 months poststroke. Design Inception cohort study. Prestroke frequency of participation was measured retrospectively in the first week poststroke. Frequency, <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and satisfaction with participation were assessed 6 months poststroke. Setting General hospitals and home residences. Participants Patients with stroke (N= 325; 65. 5 % men; mean age, 66. 9 ± 12. 2 y) admitted to 1 of 6 participating general hospitals. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (0 - 100), which consists of 3 scales: frequency, restrictions, and satisfaction. The frequency scale consists of 2 parts: vocational activities (work, volunteer work, education, household activities) and leisure and social activities. Results Vocational activities showed a large decrease (effect size: 0. 6) poststroke; leisure and social activities showed a small decrease (effect size: 0. 13) poststroke. In multiple regression analyses, both the frequency of participation in vocational activities 6 months poststroke and the decrease in vocational activities compared with before the stroke were significantly associated with the <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> experienced and satisfaction with participation after controlling for age, sex, level of education, dependency in activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, and presence of depressive symptoms. The presence of depressive symptoms showed the strongest association with the subjective experience of participation. Conclusions The frequency of participation decreased after a stroke, and this decrease was associated with <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> experienced and satisfaction with participation.

40|$|Abstract Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} of today's patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with respect to dilemmas of everyday life, especially regarding patterns of <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in valued life activities. Methods: A total of 48 patients, aged 20 - 63, three years post-RA diagnosis were interviewed using the Critical Incident Technique. Transcribed interviews were condensed into meaningful units describing actions/situations. These descriptions were linked to ICF participation codes according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) linking rules. Results: Dilemmas in everyday life were experienced in domestic life, interpersonal interactions and relationships, community, social and civic life. Most dilemmas were experienced in domestic life, including <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in, e. g. gardening, repairing houses, shovelling snow, watering pot plants, sewing or walking the dog. Also many dilemmas were experienced related to recreation and leisure within the domain community, social and civic life. The different dilemmas were often related to each other. For instance, dilemmas related to community life were combined with dilemmas within mobility, such as lifting and carrying objects. Conclusions: <b>Participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in today's RA patients are complex.

Secondary aims were to investigate potential differences between clinical subtypes and gross motor classification, and to explore other relationships between the measures under investigation. A longitudinal study of a representative sample of 184 children with ambulant CP was conducted (112 males, 72 females; 94 had unilateral spastic C P, 84 had bilateral spastic C P, and six had non-spastic forms; age range 4 - 17 y; Gross Motor Function Classification System Level I, n= 57; Level II, n= 91; Level III, n= 22; and Level IV, n= 14); energy efficiency (oxygen cost) during gait, activity limitation, <b>participation</b> <b>restriction,</b> and health status were recorded.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Participation</b> <b>restriction</b> {{is defined}} as "problems an {{individual}} may experience in involvement in life situations" and refers to the personal and societal consequences of health conditions. There is a growing interest in <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> because (i) problems with work or looking after others may be more concerning to individuals than the {{signs and symptoms of}} health conditions and (ii) even when poor health persists, participation may still be maintained. The natural history of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> in the general population is unknown and the aim of this report is to describe change in status of person-perceived <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> over three years in community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and over. Method Prospective cohort study (baseline and 3 -year follow-up) using postal questionnaires mailed to a population-based sample of older adults. Responders were included in this study if they completed all items of the Keele Assessment of Participation at baseline (n = 6965). Estimates of onset and persistence of person-perceived <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> at 3 -year follow-up were calculated for any and for each aspect of life in the sample as a whole, and then by age and gender using attrition re-weighted logistic regression to take account of sample attrition. Results In the whole sample of 6965 persons, overall participation status at three years was unchanged in 69 %, and changed in 31 %. Of 3431 persons with no restriction at baseline, it is estimated that 29. 8 % (95 % confidence interval: 27. 6 %, 32. 0 %) would report restriction in at least one aspect of life at 3 -year follow-up. Of 3534 persons who had baseline restriction, it is estimated that 68. 8 % (66. 2 %, 71. 3 %) would report continuing restriction in at least one aspect of life after 3 years. Onset and persistence both increased with age, and were most frequently recorded for restricted mobility outside the home. Conclusion Although most older persons do not change their overall participation status during a three-year period, change does occur which implies that population approaches to improving participation can be sought. Both onset and persistence of person-perceived <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> are more common the older the age-group. </p...|$|E

However, {{there has been little}} investigation on the effect on upper limb sensory impairments, activity limitations, and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions.</b> A within-subject, repeated-measures study with 12 people with chronic hemiparesis was conducted. Participants underwent a thirty minute sensorimotor mirror therapy home-based exercise program, conducted three times per week for six weeks. Compliance with the program and the effect on sensory outcomes were determined. Light touch threshold and proprioceptive error, upper limb activity limitations, and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> were measured at baseline (Week 0), immediately after (Week 6), and six weeks (Week 12) following the intervention. Compliance with the program was fair, 66 % of supervised and 62 % of unsupervised sessions were completed. The paretic hand performed worse compared to nonparetic hand at baseline with no difference in sensory measures demonstrated over time. Activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> improved by Week 12 (P < 0. 05). This sensorimotor mirror therapy home-based exercise program showed small improvements in light touch threshold and proprioception that appear to be functionally important for this group of people with chronic hemiparesis.

40|$|Purpose: To {{summarize}} measurement instruments used {{to evaluate}} activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and review {{the psychometric properties of}} these instruments. Method: General information of all included measurement instruments was extracted. The methodological quality was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Results of the measurement properties were rated based on the quality criteria of Terwee et al. Finally, overall quality was defined per psychometric property and measurement instrument by use of the quality criteria by Schellingerhout et al. Results: A total of 68 articles were identified of which eight evaluated the psychometric properties of a measurement instrument assessing activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions.</b> One disease-specific and 37 generic measurement instruments were found. Limited evidence was found for the psychometric properties and clinical usability of these instruments. However, the CFS-activities and participation questionnaire (APQ) is a disease-specific instrument with moderate content and construct validity.

Estimation of the true relationship between the separate constructs of the ICF is only possible if the items of the salient questionnaires measure exactly the constructs of interest, while not simultaneously measuring other constructs of the model. This study aimed to develop a condition specific and clinically relevant and usable instrument for patients with WAD that measures activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions,</b> {{as defined by the}} ICF framework. Methods: Item generation consisted of (1) a semi-structured interview which was conducted among 69 WAD patients; (2) a Delphi study involving 13 health professionals experienced in the assessment of patients with WAD; (3) a literature search for items from self-assessment questionnaires for neck pain. Results: A 35 -item condition-specific self-assessment questionnaire for patients with WAD was developed. This new questionnaire measures purely activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> according to the ICF and is based on patients' opinions and expert opinions. Conclusion: The whiplash activity and participation list tends to measure clinically relevant activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in WAD patients. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that interventions targeting the relief of pain and disability in musculoskeletal diseases may have differential effects on activity limitation and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> as defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods. Full data were obtained for 3 randomized controlled trials that used the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Measure (WOMAC), the Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 (SF- 36), or the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire as their primary outcome measures. The trial outcomes were reanalyzed using items previously designated as assessing pure activity limitation (A) or <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> (P), or a mixture of the 2 (A/P) only, and the results compared with the outcomes found using the full scales, which assess a mixture of outcome domains. Results. The results did not refute the hypothesis. An exercise-based intervention and injection therapies both appeared to have more effect on <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> (P) than on activity limitation (A), while a drug-based intervention had more effect on A than on P. Conclusion. Different interventions used to treat musculoskeletal disorders may have differential effects on impairment, activity limitation, and restricted participation. The use of outcome measures that do not differentiate these 3 domains may obscure the true value of an intervention. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{clinical}} voice evaluation focuses {{primarily on}} the severity of voice impairment, with little emphasis {{on the impact of}} voice disorders on the individual's quality of life. This study reports the development of a 28 -item assessment tool that evaluates the perception of voice problem, activity limitation, and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> using the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps- 2 Beta- 1 concept (World Health Organization, 1997). The questionnaire was administered to 40 subjects with dysphonia and 40 control subjects with normal voices. Results showed that the dysphonic group reported significantly more severe voice problems, limitation in daily voice activities, and restricted participation in these activities than the control group. The study also showed that the perception of a voice problem by the dysphonic subjects correlated positively with the perception of limitation in voice activities and restricted participation. However, the self-perceived voice problem had little correlation with the degree of voice-quality impairment measured acoustically and perceptually by speech pathologists. The data also showed that the aggregate scores of activity limitation and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> were positively correlated, and the extent of activity limitation and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> was similar in all except the job area. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and quantifying the impact of dysphonia on the individual's quality of life in the clinical management of voice disorders. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health defines {{participation}} as {{involvement in a}} life situation. Participation restrictions are problems experienced in any life situation, for example, in relationships or in employment. Our research explored risk factors for participation restrictions experienced by people affected by leprosy. Our objective {{was to develop a}} screening tool to identify individuals at risk. An initial round of qualitative fieldwork in eight centres in Nepal, India and Brazil identified 35 potential risk factors for <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> These were then further assessed through quantitative fieldwork in six centres in India and Brazil. In all, 264 individuals receiving leprosy treatment or rehabilitation services made a retrospective assessment of their status at time of diagnosis. Their level of <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> was assessed using the Participation Scale. Regression analysis identified risk factors for <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> including fear of abandonment by family members (odds ratio 2 • 63, 95 % CI 1 • 35 – 5 • 13) and hospitalization at diagnosis (3 • 98, 1 • 0 – 7 • 32). We recommend four consolidated items as the basis for a simple screening tool to identify individuals at risk. These are the physical impact of leprosy, an emotional response to the diagnosis, female gender and having little or no education. Such a tool may form the basis for a screening and referral procedure to identify newly diagnosed individuals at risk of participation restrictions and in need of actions that may prevent such restrictions...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} the frequency of participation 6 months poststroke compared with prestroke; and to establish whether the change is associated with <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and satisfaction with participation 6 months poststroke. Design: Inception cohort study. Prestroke frequency of participation was measured retrospectively in the first week poststroke. Frequency, <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and satisfaction with participation were assessed 6 months poststroke. Setting: General hospitals and home residences. Participants: Patients with stroke (N= 325; 65. 5 % men; mean age, 66. 9 +/- 12. 2 y) admitted to 1 of 6 participating general hospitals. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (0 - 100), which consists of 3 scales: frequency, restrictions, and satisfaction. The frequency scale consists of 2 parts: vocational activities (work, volunteer work, education, household activities) and leisure and social activities. Results: Vocational activities showed a large decrease (effect size: 0. 6) poststroke; leisure and social activities showed a small decrease (effect size: 0. 13) poststroke. In multiple regression analyses, both the frequency of participation in vocational activities 6 months poststroke and the decrease in vocational activities compared with before the stroke were significantly associated with the <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> experienced and satisfaction with participation after controlling for age, sex, level of education, dependency in activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, and presence of depressive symptoms. The presence of depressive symptoms showed the strongest association with the subjective experience of participation. Conclusions: The frequency of participation decreased after a stroke, and this decrease was associated with <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> experienced and satisfaction with participation. Resuming vocational activities and screening and, if applicable, treatment of depressive symptoms should be priorities in stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|Background: Leprosy-related {{disability}} is {{a challenge}} to public health, and social and rehabilitation services in endemic countries. Disability is more than a mere physical dysfunction, and includes activity limitations, stigma, discrimination, and social <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions.</b> We assessed the extent of disability and its determinants among persons with leprosy-related disabilities after release from multi drug treatment. Methods: We conducted a survey on disability among persons affected by leprosy in Indonesia, using a Rapid Disability Appraisal toolkit based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The toolkit included the Screening of Activity Limitation and Safety Awareness (SALSA) scale, Participation Scale, Jacoby Stigma Scale (anticipated stigma), Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) stigma scale and Discrimination assessment. Community members were interviewed using a community version of the stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression was done to identify factors associated with social participation. Results: Overall 1, 358 persons with leprosy-related disability (PLD) and 931 community members were included. Seventy-seven percent of PLD had physical impairments. Impairment status deteriorated significantly after release from treatment (from 59 % to 77 %). Around 60 % of people reported activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and 36 % anticipated stigma. As for <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> and stigma, shame, problems related to marriage and difficulties in employment were the most frequently reported problems. Major determinants of participation were severity of impairment and level of education, activity and stigma. Reported severity of community stigma correlated with severity of <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in the same districts. Discussion: The majority of respondents reported problems in all components of disability. The reported physical impairment after release from treatment justifies ongoing monitoring to facilitate early prevention. Stigma was a major determinant of social participation, and therefore disability. Stigma reduction activities and socio-economic rehabilitation are urgently needed in addition to strategies to reduce the development of further physical impairment after release from treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Limited {{research}} is available that explores major limb amputation and the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Objectives: To investigate the barriers, <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> and functioning levels experienced {{by people with}} a major limb amputation. Study design: Secondary data analysis. Method: Relevant data for 148 people with major limb amputation were extracted from the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database in Ireland. Results: The most common environmental barriers encountered were climate, physical environment and income. <b>Participation</b> <b>restriction</b> was most commonly experienced in sports/physical recreation, leisure/cultural activity and employment/job-seeking. For daily activities and functioning, the most common difficulties were with standing for long periods, walking long distances and the emotional effects of disability. Differences were found between people with an upper limb or lower limb prosthesis. Conclusion: This paper addresses the limited information available on environmental barriers, activity limitation and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> of people with a major limb amputation. Greater understanding {{of the impact of}} amputation andprosthesis type on activity, participation and environmental barriers is important to facilitate improved management and planning at the individual, service and societal level. Clinical relevance: Improved understanding of environmental barriers and challenges, activity limitations and participation restrictions experienced by individuals with major limb amputation is a critical step in informing evidence-based service delivery, intervention and policy in order to improve outcomes for this group. 35 issue: 3, page(s) : 278 - 284 Article first published online: September 21, 2011; Issue published: September 1, 2011 Received: November 21, 2010; Accepted: March 22, 2011 [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) was {{developed}} to measure reintegration to normal living after major traumas/illnesses. Its psychometric properties remain unknown when used to measure <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> under the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO-ICF) framework. This study examines {{the psychometric properties of}} the Chinese version-RNLI to measure WHO-ICF <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> among community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older people. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in community and day-care centres in Hong Kong between May 2015 and January 2016. Through face-to-face interviews, information was collected on the participants' demographic background, medical history, frailty status, depressive mood, functional performance in daily activities, and <b>participation</b> <b>restriction.</b> The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct and convergent validity of the C-RNLI were assessed. Results: Two hundred and ninety-nine pre-frail or frail community-dwelling older people {{with a mean age of}} 79. 53 were recruited. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the C-RNLI has a two-factor structure comprised of "participation in physical activities" and "participation in social events". The test-retest coefficient was 0. 71. The Cronbach's alpha of the total C-RNLI score, and those of the factors "participation in physical activities" and "participation in social events" were 0. 88, 0. 82 and 0. 84, respectively. Pre-frail older people had significantly higher scores for the factors " participation in physical activities" (z = - 5. 05, < 0. 01) and "participation in social events" (z = - 6. 04, p < 0. 01) than frail older people. Older people from community centres had significantly higher scores for the factors " participation in physical activities" (z = - 4. 48, < 0. 01) and " participation in social events" (z = - 4. 03, p< 0. 01) than older people from day-care centres. The factors " participation in physical activities" and " participation in social events" of the C-RNLI were significantly convergent with depressive mood (rs = - 0. 25 and rs = - 0. 39, respectively) and functional performance in daily activities (rs = 0. 28 and rs = 0. 45, respectively). Conclusions: The C-RNLI is a two-factor structured scale with acceptable level of reliability and validity to measure WHO-ICF <b>participation</b> <b>restriction</b> among community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older people.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of impairments and evaluate the relationships between impairments, activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> in people affected by leprosy living in The Netherlands. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-two people affected by leprosy living in The Netherlands. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was performed. Impairments were inventoried with the Total Impairment Score. Activity limitations were assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Schedule II (WHODAS-II) and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> with the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA) questionnaire. RESULTS: A high prevalence of impairments was found (83 %), mostly in hands and feet. Activity limitations were substantial, and highest for the WHODAS-II domains "household/work" and "getting around". The severity of impairments correlated significantly with activity limitations. Eye and foot impairments independently contributed to the domains "household/work" and "getting around", explaining 34 % and 40 % of variance. Poor or very poor participation (IPA) was reported by 13 - 32 % of persons, mostly in the "autonomy outdoors" and "family role" domains. These domains were associated with activity limitations and hand impairments CONCLUSIONS: People affected by leprosy in The Netherlands encounter limitations in activities and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions,</b> which {{are related to the}} severity of impairments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the impairments of upper body and limbs, activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> 6 and 12 months after operation {{for breast cancer}} and to {{examine the impact of}} impairments on activity limitations. DESIGN: A prospective survey 6 and 12 months after operation. PATIENTS: Ninety-six breast cancer patients. METHODS: A questionnaire for assessing the impairments, activity limitations and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> was developed. RESULTS: The most common impairments 6 months after operation were breast and axilla scar tightness, axilla oedema and neck-shoulder pain. At 12 -month follow-up the breast scar tightness (p= 0. 008) and axilla oedema (p= 0. 023) decreased, and limb ache (p= 0. 005) increased significantly. The most limiting impairments were axilla oedema and limb numbness 6 months after operation, and at 12 -month follow-up axilla oedema. Lifting, carrying and reaching out caused worsening of impairments to {{more than half of the}} respondents at 6 -month follow-up. Regression analysis showed that many impairments together were determinants of activity limitations and sleep impairment. <b>Participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> were constant.

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Forty-nine patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1 a. METHODS: Perceived upper limb functioning was evaluated using the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire and <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions</b> with the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire. Upper and lower limb domains of Guy's Neurological Disability Scale {{were used to determine}} their impact on <b>participation</b> <b>restrictions.</b> RESULTS: Limitations in upper limb functioning were perceived by 98 % of the patients. Median scores ranged between 70 points for overall hand function and 100 points for aesthetics (scale 0 - 100). Patients were least satisfied with dominant hand performance. Most patients (46 - 78 %) reported their participation to be sufficient. Restrictions were reported in the domains work, family roles, and autonomy outdoors.
