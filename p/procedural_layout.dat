40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} layout-in-loop {{synthesis}} method for radio-frequency LNAs, which uses symbolic performance models (SPMs), parameterized layout generator and high-frequency extraction techniques in the synthesis loop. The primary focus of this work is on performance estimation using efficient SPMs and development of techniques to include layout parasitics symbolically into the SPMs {{before the start of}} synthesis. SPMs for noise figure and distortion parameters are obtained using repetitive and weakly nonlinear symbolic analysis and are stored as pre-compiled Element Coefficient Diagrams (ECDs). Speedy layout generation is achieved by using parameterized <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> generators and full parasitic extraction is done by using multiple extractors. Quasi-static extraction is used to obtain the critical parasitic effects of interconnects and on-chip inductors. The proposed methodology is used for the synthesi...|$|E

A Python-based layout generation tool generates different layout styles {{for the same}} basic analog building blocks. Moreover, layout dependent parasitic parameters such as stress effects are easily computed and compared for different layout styles. The <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> description is written using a Python API that ensures layout portability over different technologies. A main focus is on how the layout generation tool addresses both geometric and parasitic- aware electrical synthesis. This is made possible through an internal loop that links circularly both the sizing phase and the layout generation phase. The proposed design methodology assists the analog designer in exploring electrical and physical trade-offs. At the end, we present synthesis and characterization results that prove the effectiveness and speed of the proposed methodology...|$|E

In particular, we describe three opportunities for coupling circuit optimization operations with the library development process.

This effort has been largely motivated by a need for alternatives to manual layout thereby reducing library development costs and time to market. The most common approaches are layout generators, re-compaction of existing libraries, and automatic cell synthesis. <b>Procedural</b> <b>layout</b> generators, which are either languagebased or interfaced with a symbolic layout system, are a means of capturing the layout design in a somewhat designrule independent fashion.

40|$|A {{road network}} {{is one of}} the core {{elements}} of urban environments, strongly defining their <b>layout.</b> <b>Procedural</b> modeling has been increasingly used to create such road networks. However, many procedural methods are complex and difficult to master by non-experts, often have a limited and hard-to-control expressive range, and require a variety of specialized input data to generate a complex road network. To mitigate this, some methods proposed to use stochastic data on road patches extracted from example maps to design a road network following a given urban style. We propose a novel patch-based method that uses the semantics of individual patches to help guiding the procedural generation. Our approach combines the advantages of patch-based generation with those of conventional parametric-based methods. Due to the intuitive character of semantic parameters and tags, our approach provides for an easy customization of fictive road network creation, allowing a user to easily define various types of road network styles, containing only the desired features and structures of real-world road networks.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a layout generation tool {{that aims to}} reduce the gap between electrical sizing and physical realization of high performance analog circuits. The <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> approach is shown to be best suited {{for this kind of}} methodology. Once captured, the procedural description can be used several times to calculate both rapidly and accurately all parasitics that appear during physical realizations without layout generation. Efficient algorithms are developed to take into account analog layout constraints such as matching, parasitic control, shape and reliability considerations. This allows one to account for these effects early in the design which guarantees the fulfilment of the required performance specifications, permits one to optimize various design aspects in the presence of parasitics and shortens the overall design time by avoiding laborious sizing-layout iterations. An example of a high performance OTA is presented at the end to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach...|$|E
40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDAA ([URL] audienceThis paper {{presents}} the novel idea of multi-placement structures, for a fast and optimized placement instantiation in analog circuit synthesis. These structures need to be generated only once for a specific circuit topology. When used in synthesis, these pre-generated structures instantiate various layout floorplans for various sizes and parameters of a circuit. Unlike <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> generators, they enable fast placement of circuits while keeping {{the quality of the}} placements at a high level during a synthesis process. The fast placement is a result of high speed instantiation resulting from the efficiency of the multi-placement structure. The good quality of placements derive from the extensive and intelligent search process that is used to build the multi-placement structure. The target benchmarks of these structures are analog circuits in the vicinity of 25 modules. An algorithm for the generation of such multi-placement structures is presented. Experimental results show placement execution times with an average of a few milliseconds making them usable during layout-aware synthesis for optimized placements...|$|E
40|$|Iterations between {{separate}} phases in any procedural design process, {{usually a}} by-product of unexpected (or, simply, very complex to consider) adverse effects, clearly play against any time-to-market requirements. In analog integrated circuit (IC) design, {{going back and forth}} between electrical and physical synthe- sis to counterbalance layout-induced performance degradations needs to be thus avoided as much as possible. One possible solution involves the integration of the 1 traditionally separated electrical and physical synthesis phases, by including layout- induced effects, in the form of layout parasitics, right into the electrical synthesis phase, in what has been called parasitic-aware synthesis. This solution, as such, is not yet complete since there are geometric requirements (minimization of the occu- pied area or fulfillment of certain layout aspect ratio, among others), whose effects on the resulting parasitics are not usually considered during electrical synthesis. In this chapter, a layout-aware solution that tackles both geometric and parasitic-aware electrical synthesis is proposed. This technique uses a combination of simulation- based optimization, <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> generation, exhaustive geometric evaluation algorithms, and several mechanisms for parasitic estimation. Thanks to the nature of this combination, the solution benefits from, and also fosters, reuse of analog intellectual property (IP) blocks. Several detailed design examples are provided.

40|$|Analog design reuse is {{becoming}} more and more important in recent system-on-chip designs. In these designs electrical and physical design integration is a challenging problem specially when designing high performance analog circuits in different technologies. To solve this problem, we propose a new design methodology based on a layout-oriented synthesis approach that allows to capture design knowledge for eventual reuse with a close interaction between electrical and physical design. This methodology guarantees the fulfillment of the required performance specifications, permits to optimize various design aspects in the presence of parasitics and shortens the overall design time by avoiding laborious sizing-layout iterations. The methodology has been implemented using two knowledge-based tools dedicated to analog circuit sizing (COMDIAC) and layout generation (CAIRO). The tools allow both the design knowledge and the generated layout to be efficiently reused in similar designs. To validate the previous claims, we have chosen low-voltage low-power analog circuits as an application. Our study has led to new circuit architectures that allow very low-voltage switchedcapacitor circuit operation in standard CMOS technologies. Using the above methodology and circuit techniques, we have designed, fabricated, and tested a 1 -V 14 -bit Delta-Sigma A/D modulator for digital-audio applications. Two similar designs are then resynthesized in another technology demonstrating the suitability of the methodology for very high performance mixed-signal circuits.

40|$|The 21 st {{century has}} {{witnessed}} a blossoming of rating, evaluation or even blacklisting sites. Namely, teachers, lawyers and doctors are rated openly by their students, clients and patients. We {{are living in}} a ‘reputation nation,’ where our conducts are evaluated often by anonymous individuals in different aspects, entailing the dangers of shame sanctions. This reputation rating system is far from being a system of formal adjudication. It may carry false or incorrect information, and may not allow an individual to correct such information. Relying on defamation law may not be helpful to the victim targeted as the defendant maybe an anonymous individual expressing his honest opinion. Equally, invoking privacy law may be a frustrating experience when the information is of legitimate public interest and it is already in the public domain. In the absence of satisfactory legal solution and remedies, some have resorted to alternative methods of “reputation management. ” What has yet to be addressed is the issue of how to develop a new <b>procedural</b> <b>layout</b> that can accommodate social norms, technological advancement and the legal right to protect reputation on online platforms. This article returns to the fundamental rationale behind the protection of reputation, and argues that reputation is an inherently social and relational concept that serves a significant signaling function in society. Drawing on judicial jurisprudence in the US and Germany on online rating sites, this article advocates for a new regime that requires online rating sites to have appropriate netiquette and information policy, including the right to reply amongst other requirements. This is essential not only to protect individual’s reputation but also for establishing a reliable system for civility. postprin...|$|E
