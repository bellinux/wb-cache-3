40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} organisational sustainability in the small- to medium-sized enterprises (SME) context focussing on a resource-based view. The <b>paper</b> <b>overlays</b> two contrasting perspectives: those of the SME and human resource (HR) perspectives to allow for the development of a composite model of organisational sustainability for SMEs. Design/methodology/approach – The <b>paper</b> <b>overlays</b> four models of Carson’s (1985, 1990) small firm evolution and unique characteristics of SMEs; Wright et al. ’s (2001) pertaining to the application of the resource-based view of the firm perspective to strategic HR and Boudreau and Ramstad (2005) model of effectiveness, efficiency and impact of talentship. The paper, in particular, considers the human resource management (HRM) perspectives pertaining to the overlay and considers how these might impact organisational sustainability. Findings – An outcome of the paper is the development of a composite model to the SME and HR perspectives of organisational sustainability and its applicability to the SME context. Research limitations/implications – The paper suggests a number of emergent areas for future research. Future research should focus on the intangible aspects and softer elements of the organisational resource base. The majority of work in this area is grounded in the positivist paradigm. Future research should consider a pluralists perspective and draw on traditions of the post-positivist paradigm, for example, social constructionism. Practical implications – SME-support agencies and consultants who work with SMEs need, therefore, to work with them in assessing their competency spectra and then to help them develop the talent pools required to effect continued growth and success. In doing so SMEs need to be guided towards a better understanding of the traditional temporal cycle of recruitment; in essence, they need to ensure that they have the right competency set in situ in the early stages of the firms’ development. Originality/value – This paper is unique in its approach to the examination of sustainability within the context of SMEs and, in particular, the HRM aspects which contribute towards organisational survival, growth and sustainability...|$|R

This overlay map technique may support competitive intelligence and policy decision-making. The global patent map is based on similarities in citing-to-cited relationships between categories of theInternational Patent Classification (IPC) of European Patent Office (EPO) patents from 2000 to 2006. This patent dataset, extracted from the PATSTAT database, includes 760, 000 patent records in 466 IPC-based categories. We compare the global patent maps derived from this categorization to related efforts of other global patent maps. The <b>paper</b> <b>overlays</b> nanotechnology-related patenting activities of two companies and two different nanotechnology subfields on the global patent map.

Transmission capacities of the overlaid networks are analyzed, which are defined as the maximum densities of the ad hoc nodes and mobile users under an outage constraint.

Deploying overlaid networks based on frequency separation is proved to achieve higher network capacities than that based on spatial separation. Furthermore, spatial diversity is shown to enhance network capacities. I...|$|R

This <b>paper</b> shows that <b>overlay</b> networks can provide forward and backward secrecy for application data in an adhoc network.

The neighborhood key method avoids expensive global re-keying operations when the membership in the network changes or when the network is partitioned. The method is evaluated in a newly developed application-layer ad-hoc routing protocol. Both the adhoc routing protocol and the security scheme are implemented in a software system for application-layer overlay networks. Extensive indoor and outdoor measurement experiments with handheld wireless devices {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the neighborhood key method and the performance of application-layer ad-hoc networks.

40|$|Mass-customization is a {{megatrend}} {{that also}} affects the wood industry. To obtain individually designed laminates in batch size one efficient printing and processing technologies are required. Digital printing was envisaged {{as it does}} not depend on highly costly printing cylinders (as used in rotogravure printing) and allows rapid exchange of the printing designs. In the present work, two wellestablished digital printing approaches, the multi-pass and the single-pass technique, were investigated and evaluated for their applicability in decorating engineered wood and low-pressure melamine films. Three different possibilities of implementing digital printing in the decorative laminates manufacturing process were studied: (1) digital printing on coated chipboard and subsequently applying a lacquered top-coat or melamine overlay (designated as “direct printing”, since the LPM was the printing substrate), (2) digital printing on decorative paper which was subsequently impregnated before hot pressing (designated as “indirect printing, variant A”) and (3) digital printing on decorative paper with subsequent interlamination of the paper between impregnated under- and <b>overlay</b> <b>paper</b> layers during the pressing process (designated as “indirect printing, variant B”). Due to various advantages of the resulting cured melamine resin surfaces including a much better technological performance and flexibility in surface texture design, it was decided to industrially further pursue only the indirect digital printing process comprising interlamination and the direct printing process with a melamine overlay-finishing. Basis for the successful trials on production and laboratory scales were the identification of applicable inks (in terms of compatibility with melamine resin) and of appropriate printing paper quality (in terms of impregnation and imprinting ability). After selection and fine tuning of suitable materials, the next challenge to overcome was the initially insufficient bond strength between impregnated overlay and the ink layers which led to unsatisfactory quality of the print appearance and delamination effects. However, the optimization of the pressing program {{and the development of a}} modified impregnation procedure for the underlay and <b>overlay</b> <b>papers</b> allowed the successful implementation of digital printing in the production line of our industrial partner FunderMax...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Delivering {{multicast}} data using so-called overlay networks {{offers many}} advantages. Overlay networks only {{consisting of a}} multicast group’s members that are connected by means of transport links, non-members (especially routers) {{no longer need to}} bother about multicast routing and keeping a group’s state information. While existing application layer multicast protocols mainly were designed for the fixed Internet, first attempts to adapt such protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks start emerging. Because these adaptions however still suffer from a relatively high rate of packet losses, this paper outlines generic mechanisms that improve the overall delivery ratio for application layer multicast protocols. Although the proposed mechanisms are illustrated at the example of the NICE-MAN protocol (which is an adaption of the NICE protocol, originating from the Internet), they may be applied to arbitrary <b>overlays.</b> Furthermore, this <b>paper</b> shows how <b>overlay</b> networks combined with the developed mechanisms can be used, to significantly improve delivery ratios for existing multicast protocols (like ODMRP, M-AODV) that reside on the network layer.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{shows how}} the {{multicast}} nature of proposed future publish/subscribe network architectures can assist mobility. Publish/subscribe is an information-centric networking paradigm. Unlike the current send/receive based Internet architecture which favours the sender of information, the publish/subscribe paradigm leads to a more balanced relationship between entities. Publish/subscribe is considered a promising architecture for the future Internet as it can potentially address various current Internet problems, such as spam and (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks. In a pub/sub architecture all data are transmitted via multicast and end host identification, which has a less critical role to begin with, is decoupled from location identification. In such an environment, fast mobility can be supported effectively, particularly for continuous media distribution (such as mobile TV) {{and other types of}} real-time multimedia applications. In this <b>paper,</b> a prototype <b>overlay</b> multicast scheme based on Scribe is extended to support mobility. We compare this scheme against an alternative solution based on Mobile IPv 6 and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the basic trade-offs.

In this study, the substantial improvement of dirt repellence of HPLs with simultaneous enhancement of its abrasion resistance was achieved {{for the first time}} by incorporating nonafluorohexyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (FH-POSS) nanoparticles (up to 1 % w/w) into a melamine formaldehyde (MF) resin matrix used to impregnate decorative and <b>overlay</b> <b>papers</b> required for HPLs production. FH-POSS particles were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by C- 13 and Si- 29 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fluoroalkyl moieties in FH-POSS afforded increased hydrophobicity to HPLs thus providing improved surface clean ability, whereas abrasion resistance was improved due to the robust silica core of the POSS particles. Hydrophobicity of HPLs doped with FH-POSS increased with time, after resin curing, and this was attributed to migration of FH-POSS nanoparticles to the composite surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.
