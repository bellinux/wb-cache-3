5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{name for}} Ganesha in the Tamil language is <b>Pille</b> or Pillaiyar (Little Child). A. K. Narain differentiates these terms {{by saying that}} <b>pille</b> means a [...] "child" [...] while pillaiyar means a [...] "noble child". He adds that the words pallu, pella, and pell in the Dravidian family of languages signify [...] "tooth or tusk of an elephant", but more generally [...] "elephant". Anita Raina Thapan notes that the root word <b>pille</b> in the name Pillaiyar might have originally meant [...] "the young of the elephant", because the Pali word pillaka means [...] "a young elephant".|$|R

40|$|National audienceThe {{conquest of}} Europe, first by Napoleon {{and then by}} Hitler, was {{accompanied}} by the systematic plunder of artistic works. This tactic was {{in keeping with the}} logic of classical warfare, aiming, in other words, to humiliate the vanquished and exalt the victors. Recent publications enable us to investigate this phenomenon anew. Art is undeniably {{at the heart of the}} symbolic systems of authoritarian states, and the artistic choices are very revealing as to the nature of those regimes. When the conflict is over, the restitution of the plundered works of art gives rise to important questions in the ransacked countries, leading to a reflection on their own heritage and therefore on their identity as regards their adversary’s standpoint. La conquête de l’Europe par Napoléon puis par Hitler s’accompagne d’un important pillage artistique qui s’inscrit dans des logiques de guerre classiques: humiliation du vaincu, exaltation de la victoire. Les publications récentes permettent de revisiter le parallèle. Il se confirme que l’art se trouve au cœur des systèmes symboliques des États autoritaires et que les choix réalisés sont révélateurs de la nature des régimes. Surtout, la restitution des œuvres au lendemain des conflits suscite d’importantes interrogations dans les pays <b>pillés,</b> amenés à réfléchir à leur patrimoine, donc à leur identité, au regard des choix de l’adversaire...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{institutional}} history of Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, Inc. (JCR), an organization {{mandated by the}} Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) to assume trusteeship over heirless Jewish cultural property that had been plundered by the Nazis and later centralized in depots in the American Zone of Germany {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. Formally established in 1947, until 1951 JCR functioned as the cultural arm of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO) and distributed hundreds of thousands of books, thousands of ceremonial objects, and Torah scrolls to Jewish communities around the world including the United States, Israel, West Germany, Britain, and Canada. Looking beyond its mandated mission, JCR was also involved in searching for caches of Jewish property in the Allied zones, microfilming manuscripts and archives in German public institutions, and negotiating the enactment of West German legislation to safeguard future discoveries of Jewish property. Salo Baron, professor of Jewish history at Columbia University, was JCR's founder and president; many of the foremost Jewish intellectuals of the day, including Hannah Arendt, Gershom Scholem, and Leo Baeck were associated with it. This study of JCR sheds light on numerous topics, not the least of which is the political activities of Jewish academics in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Further, the internecine struggles among Jewish organizations over which group best represented world Jewry as trustee of this property is highlighted along with the development of JCR from a research commission to a U. S. -recognized supervisory body. JCR's interactions with the State and War departments as well as with the American military government in Germany add to the discussion of Jewish influence during this period. The examination of JCR's activities in the American zone between 1948 and 1951 serves to underscore the diligent work that was carried out, but also the less than ideal conditions in which this work was done. The distribution process undertaken by JCR and its member organizations emphasizes the debate surrounding what it meant to culturally reconstruct the Jewish world after the Holocaust. Finally, a discussion of JCR's very limited activities, from 1952 to 1977 when it was finally dissolved, underscores the difficulties inherent in maintaining a relevant rationale and function in an ever-changing political landscape. Cette these presente l'histoire institutionnelle de la Jewish CulturalReconstruction, Inc. (JCR), une organisation mandatee par le bureau dugouvernement militaire des Etats Unis (OMGUS) pour assumer la tutelle desbiens juifs culturels sans heritier, qui ont ete <b>pilles</b> par les nazis et plus tardcentralises dans les depots de la zone americaine en Allemagne apres la DeuxiemeGuerre mondiale. De sa creation officielle en 1947 a 1951, la JCR a fonctionnecomme l'antenne culturelle de la Jewish Restitution Successor Organization(JRSO). Elle a distribue des centaines de milliers de livres, des milliers d'objetsrituels et des rouleaux de Torah aux communautes juives dans le monde,notamment aux Etats-Unis, en Israel, en Allemagne de l'Ouest, en Grande-Bretagne et au Canada.
