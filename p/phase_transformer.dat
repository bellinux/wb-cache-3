If a winding is connected to earth (grounded), the earth connection point is usually the center point of a wye winding. If the secondary is a delta winding, the ground may be connected to a center tap on one winding (high leg delta) or one phase may be grounded (corner grounded delta). A special purpose polyphase transformer is the zigzag transformer. There are many possible configurations that may involve more or fewer than six windings and various tap connections.|$|E

It is called [...] "orange leg" [...] because when it is connected per the NEC, the high leg is marked with orange [...] "outer finish...or other effective means" [...] (usually tape).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} analysis {{obtained for}} the design of single <b>phase</b> <b>transformer.</b> The method is simple, efficient and accurate, by an exhaustive analysis. The following constraints are imposed: excitation current, load fractions, efficiency and voltage regulations. The methodology of this paper requires only two input data: primary side of the transformer and the secondary side of the transformer. The input side of the transformer include the following parameters; voltage, current and power while the secondary side of the transformer includes; voltage, current, efficiency, voltage regulation. These data are included in the transformer nameplate. In this paper, the minimization of the following four objective functions is considered: total owing cost, mass, total losses and material cost was considered. The consideration of these four objective functions is implemented automatically by running the analysis several times without intervention of a designer. Consequently, transformer manufacturers save design man-hours and increase capacity. The optimized solutions of transformer design are validated with laboratory and process measurements. In this paper the simulation of single <b>phase</b> <b>transformer</b> with different supplies such as Load Test and efficiency of voltage regulation are carried out...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Electrical {{transformers}} {{are designed}} to work at rated frequency and sinusoidal voltage and current waves. At present time the use of non linear loads, such as power electronic loads are increased and this leads to increase of power loss of transformer. The problem of increasing the power loss leads to several problems including increasing {{the temperature of the}} transformer, insulation damage and decrease the operational life of the transformer. To avoid these problems in case of non linear loads, transformer should work with capacity less than the rated capacity given by the designer. In this research different type of losses in a 2 KVA three <b>phase</b> <b>transformer</b> are studied with linear and non linear loads, also the effect of harmonics on transformer loss are evaluated. The linear loads are simulated by a pure resistance but the non linear loads are simulated by a three phase bridge rectifier, also a three single phase rectifiers are simulated as a non linear load to obtain the effect of third harmonic. The different types of losses and capacity of a three <b>phase</b> <b>transformer</b> is then evaluated analytically and simulation in MATLAB/SIMULINK and results are compared. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} of three <b>phase</b> five leg <b>transformer</b> under voltage sag is studied in this paper. This paper proposes a simple, practical {{model of a}} three phase-five leg, saturated transformer with accurate performance. Transformer saturation is produced when the voltage sag is recovered and it causes inrush current in transformer. Effects of voltage sag depth, duration and initial point on wave have been analyzed in this paper. Initial point on wave can produce maximum inrush current in five leg transformers while comparing with three leg transformers. The magnetic circuit symmetry of five leg transformer produces the more symmetrical shape of inrush current curves versus initial point on wave and sag duration than three leg transformer. The simulations show that current peak has a periodical dependence on sag duration and linear dependence on sag depth.
