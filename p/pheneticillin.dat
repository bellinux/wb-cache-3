50|$|<b>Pheneticillin</b> (or phenethicillin) is a penicillin. It is not {{approved}} by the FDA {{for use in the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|From 1945, Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd (which {{merged with}} SmithKline, then with Glaxo, to become GlaxoSmithKline) {{operated}} from Brockham Park {{at the southern}} end of the village.In 1959, Brockham Park became famous when Beecham scientists there discovered the penicillin nucleus, 6-APA (6-aminopenicillanic acid); this discovery allowed the synthesis of a number of new semisynthetic penicillins. In 1959, Beecham marketed <b>pheneticillin,</b> followed shortly by methicillin (or meticillin), which is active against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ('golden staph'). [...] In time some bacterial strains developed resistance to these antibiotics, such as the MRSA (for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The site is now a housing estate.|$|E

A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the efficacy of a single-dose preoperative prophylactic of the penicillin <b>pheneticillin</b> compared with placebo in the antibiotic prophylaxis of surgical wound infections in intra-oral bone grafting procedures. Patients and Methods. Twenty patients (age range 20 - 45 years) underwent an intra-oral buccal onlay graft procedure. After randomization, a placebo or 2 grams of <b>pheneticillin</b> were administered orally one hour before surgery in a double-blind fashion. During three months, the postoperative course was observed according to clinical parameters of infection. Both groups were homogeneous in their composition and established risk factors for surgical wound infection. The frequency of surgical wound infections, as defined by the Centers of Disease control in 1992, were compared and evaluated statistically. Results. Two patients developed a wound infection at the receptor site; two patients developed an infection at both the receptor and donor sites; and one patient developed an infection at the donor site only. All of these patients received a placebo. No infections were seen in the <b>pheneticillin</b> group. There was a statistically significant increased risk of having an infectious complication after an intra-oral bone graft without antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusion. The results of this study support the efficacy of single-dose, preoperative, oral antibiotic administratio...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{antimicrobial}} effects of phenoxymethylpenicillin (PM) and <b>pheneticillin</b> (PE) in vitro {{and in an}} experimental animal infection model were compared {{as well as the}} pharmacokinetic properties of both drugs in patients. For the inhibitory effect of PM on short-term (3 h) growth of S. aureus in vitro, this drug was 2. 13 times more potent than PE. The protein binding of both drugs was similar (78 - 80 %). The potency ratio of PM to PE against S. aureus in an experimental mouse-thigh infection was only 1. 25 to 1. This is explained by the difference in the AUC after subcutaneous administration of PM (0. 47 mg 1 (- 1) h) and PE (0. 92 mg 1 (- 1) h). The plasma clearance after intravenous administration of PM was 476. 4 ml/min and that of PE was 295. 1 ml/min; the plasma clearance of both drugs was strongly correlated with the creatinine clearance. The volume of distribution in the steady state of PM was 35. 41 and that of PE 22. 51. In 10 patients, the absorption after oral administration of PM as the acid was 48 % and that of the potassium salt of PE was 86 % of the dose. From the present results it can be concluded that a difference in effectiveness of different formulations of PM and PE would depend entirely on differences in absorption...|$|E
