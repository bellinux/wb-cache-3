5|$|The cold opening {{features}} Michael {{trying to}} get {{various members of the}} office involved in a pyramid scheme, which is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> to the public. The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also fallen for a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E
25|$|A {{trademark}} is {{a recognizable}} sign, design or expression which distinguishes <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> {{of a particular}} trader from the similar <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> of other traders.|$|E
25|$|For {{trademarks}} {{which are}} considered to be well known, infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> which {{are not the same as}} or similar to the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> in relation to which the owner's mark is registered.|$|E
50|$|Governments request {{competitive}} contract proposals {{when they}} {{believe there are}} more issues than initial cost in buying a needed <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> In addition to cost, governments often consider issues such as risk (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> meet the government need?), schedule (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> be delivered <b>or</b> finished in time?), quality (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> meet the need each time it is delivered or needed?), long-term cost (i.e., What is {{the total cost of}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> over its lifetime?). Most governments use proposals to buy any product that is not a commodity <b>or</b> to buy <b>services</b> that are not routine.|$|R
50|$|Complementors are {{businesses}} that directly sell a <b>product</b> (<b>or</b> <b>products)</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (<b>or</b> <b>services)</b> that complement the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> of another company by adding value to mutual customers; for example, Intel and Microsoft (Pentium processors and Windows), or Microsoft and McAfee (Microsoft Windows & McAfee anti-virus).|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> If a significant market for the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> cannot be established, then there is no project.|$|R
25|$|Acquiring bank: The {{financial}} institution accepting {{payment for the}} <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> {{on behalf of the}} merchant.|$|E
25|$|Merchant: The {{individual}} or business accepting credit card payments for <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> {{sold to the}} cardholder.|$|E
25|$|E.g.: the marketing-processes, {{intended}} {{to create and}} maintain a market for the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> of the organization.|$|E
50|$|This is {{commonly}} a one-page website which describes {{the product and}} asks the visitor to signup to the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> before the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is actually available. The customer is unaware that the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> does not yet exist but must give some form of payment {{in order to get}} access.|$|R
50|$|A {{potential}} customer of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{would have}} an interest in viewing information on how a particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> stands in terms of subjective or objective quality before making a purchasing decision. Potential customers may also be interested in leaving feedback on a particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to explain why they didn’t make their purchase.|$|R
50|$|A value {{proposition}} {{is a statement}} which identifies clear, measurable and demonstrable benefits consumers get when buying a particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> It should convince consumers that this <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is better than others on the market. This proposition {{can lead to a}} competitive advantage when consumers pick that particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> over other competitors because they receive greater value.|$|R
25|$|Trademark {{infringement}} {{occurs when}} one party uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly {{similar to a}} trademark owned by another party, in relation to <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> which are identical or similar to the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.|$|E
25|$|EDI Health Care Claim Status Request (276) This {{transaction}} set {{can be used}} by a provider, recipient of health care <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> or their authorized agent to request the status of a health care claim.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{trademark}} rights generally arise out of the use of, or to maintain exclusive rights over, that sign in relation to certain <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> assuming there are no other trademark objections.|$|E
5000|$|Companies already {{generating}} <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> revenue {{can also}} growth their success with PLSG programs for market expansion, new <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> development, workforce development, investor relations and industry collaboration.1----1 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} sloganeering process communicates {{the value}} of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to customers, for the purpose of selling the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> It is a business function for attracting customers.|$|R
5000|$|Value Stream: The entire flow of a <b>product's</b> <b>or</b> <b>service's</b> life cycle. In other words, from raw materials, {{production}} of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service,</b> customer delivery, customer use, and final disposal.|$|R
25|$|The GHG footprint, or {{greenhouse}} gas footprint, {{refers to the}} amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> It is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint, which measures only carbon dioxide, one of many {{greenhouse gas}}es.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> {{regardless of the}} price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers {{are aware of the}} company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E
25|$|Women in Business Romania is a membership-based {{organization}} that connects its members through an online platform, {{helping them to}} find other businesswomen, <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> that can aid them in their activity, facilitating access to other business events, offering information about startups and promoting success stories through interviews and articles.|$|E
50|$|A {{smoke test}} {{is a method}} for {{determining}} if there is sufficient customer demand for a given value proposition of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to justify building the actual <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
40|$|The classic {{definition}} of quality is “the {{ability of a}} <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to consistently meet or exceed a customer’s expectations. ” An important element of the definition, customer’s expectations, requires further defining since cus-tomers value certain aspects of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> and they therefore associate those aspects with its quality. <b>Product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> quality has many facets. Quality might include the following elements: • Performance or the main characteristic of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Aesthetics, which include the “look and feel ” of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Special features of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Conformance <b>or</b> how well the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> aligns with the customer’s expectations. • Safety, which includes the element of risk of injury or harm. • Reliability {{or the ability to}} consistently deliver the intended results. • Durability or the useful life of the prod-uct <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Reputation of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> Different customers will have differ-ent expectations of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> based on the relative value they place on these components at a given moment in time. To make a determination of the quality of an educational program, one must identify the customers and their expectations of the program as they relate to the facets they deem most important. This is particularly true when a program, such as technology education, purports a significant change in it focus, content, and importance. In essence, the perceived quality of the new program will be influ-enced by the reputation of the program it has replaced, its academic home, and the faculty associated with the program...|$|R
50|$|Consumer to {{consumer}} (C2C) marketing {{is the creation}} of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> with the specific promotional strategy being for consumers to share that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> with others as brand advocates based on the value of the product. The investment into concepting and developing a top of the line <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> that consumers are actively looking for is equitable to a retail pre-launch product awareness marketing.|$|R
25|$|According to the agency, Groupon {{breached}} {{the conditions}} offered and contracted with consumers, in particular due to non-compliance with deadlines offered and committed for {{the delivery of}} <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> It even accuses it of not delivering the items purchased by consumers, with the consequent unilateral cancellation of purchases or having offered products and services without stock available.|$|E
25|$|Major tech {{corporations}} {{have tried to}} use Second Life to market <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> to Second Lifes tech-savvy audience. For example, IBM purchased 12 islands within Second Life for virtual training and simulations of key businesses processes. Musicians, podcasters, and news organizations (including CNET, Reuters, NPR's The Infinite Mind, and the BBC) all established a presence within Second Life.|$|E
25|$|A pyramid scheme (commonly {{known as}} pyramid scams) is a {{business}} model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.|$|E
50|$|Customers of {{products}} and services are a primary party {{in the process of}} reviewing. Customers are closely connected to the process as they would have first-hand experience with a product and service. Their primary role would be detailing their experiences with the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> A customer’s interest in crowdreviewing would stem from an interest in showing their appreciation towards the quality of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> <b>or</b> in voicing their concerns or disappointment in a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
25|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (rather than to distinguish the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|R
5000|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of B2B marketing {{is that it}} is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to the customer's situation. In B2C marketing, the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{extent to}} which a {{trademark}} owner may prevent unauthorized use of trademarks which are the same as or similar to its trademark depends on various factors such as whether its trademark is registered, the similarity of the trademarks involved, the similarity of the <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> involved, and whether the owner's trademark is well known or, under U.S. law relating to trademark dilution, famous.|$|E
25|$|Affiliate {{marketing}} {{overlaps with}} other Internet marketing methods to some degree, because affiliates often use regular advertising methods. Those methods include organic search engine optimization (SEO), paid {{search engine marketing}} (PPC – Pay Per Click), e-mail marketing, content marketing and in some sense display advertising. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews of <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> offered by a partner.|$|E
25|$|Recreational (including technical) {{scuba diving}} {{does not have}} a {{centralised}} certifying or regulatory agency, and is mostly self regulated. There are, however, several international organisations of varying size and market share that train and certify divers and dive instructors, and many diving related sales and rental outlets require proof of diver certification from one of these organisations prior to selling or renting certain diving <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> (rather than to distinguish the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a general}} sense, market {{production}} {{refers to the}} production of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> which is intended for sale at a money-price in a market. The <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> in principle has to be tradable for money.|$|R
