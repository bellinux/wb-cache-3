5000|$|Originally, {{a dresser}} {{was located in}} the kitchen and was a {{utilitarian}} piece of furniture where meat and other food was dressed or prepared, while prepared food was placed on sideboards in the dining room ready to be served.

When cold, slices of the porridge could be cut out and taken out of the house for later consumption. Gradually the purely utilitarian function of the dresser was supplemented with other functions, such as a means of displaying the best crockery in a farmhouse. Once it became a means of display the dresser could also be found in dining rooms where it served as sideboard and a place to store and display dinner ware.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{parametric}} stress analysis of various configurations of <b>rack</b> <b>plate</b> stiffened multi-planar welded KK joints using the finite element method. The KK joint finds application {{in the leg}} structure of offshore Oil & Gas jack-up platforms. The <b>rack</b> <b>plate</b> is a dual purpose element of the joint because it firstly functions as a stiffener which reduces the stress concentration at the brace/chord intersection. This could be an immense contribution {{to the increase in}} fatigue life of the joint but other hot spot sites are introduced to the joint. The rack is also used for raising and lowering of the jack-up hull which gives the jack-up platform its jacking capability. Over 120 models using a combination of shell and solid elements were built and analysed within ABAQUS. Non-dimensional joint geometric parameters; β, γ and Ω were employed in the study with Ω being defined as the ratio of rack thickness to chord diameter. Stress Concentration Factors (SCFs) were calculated under applied axial and OPB (out-of-plane-bending) loading. Three critical SCF locations were identified for each load case, with each location becoming the most critical based on the combination of the non-dimensional parameters selected for the joint. This is important as careful design can shift the critical SCF from an area inaccessible to NDT to one that can be easily inspected. The SCF values extracted from the models were used to derive six parametric equations through multiple regression analysis performed using MINITAB. The equations describe the SCF at the different locations {{as a function of the}} non-dimensional ratios. The equations not only allow the rapid optimisation of multi-planar joints but also can be used to quickly identify the location of maximum stress concentration and hence the likely position of fatigue cracks. This in itself is an invaluable tool for planning NDT procedures and schedules...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sn {{whiskers}} {{can grow}} spontaneously {{on the surface}} in Sn alloy coatings. This paper focused on the mechanism of whisker growth on the pure Sn coating to Cu leads in electronic components. After the <b>rack</b> <b>plating</b> process the pure Sn coating was annealed at 150 ºC for one hour and measured about 10 µm in thickness. Then samples endured the high temperature/humidity storage tests (60 °C and 87 %RH) from 1 month to 6 months. The experimental results revealed that Sn whiskers were prone to grow from the surface with local corrosion in the Sn coating. This was the high temperature/humidity storage provided much moisture to cause an electrochemistry corrosion between Sn and H 2 O. The excess formation of SnO 2 had a large molar volume comparing to Sn and this generated a high inner stress in the corroded areas to shear the coating surface producing the defects. The compressive stress deriving from the formation of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds drove Sn whiskers initially grew from the corroded areas...|$|R

An Iron-plated copper plate, which was made by electroplating iron onto an oxygen-free copper substrate, was used as the test piece. The reaction test was carried out by using an oven in normal air. The solder was placed on the test piece and it was put into an oven held at 400, 430 and 460 C. The interface between the solder and plated iron was particularly examined. It was found that the intermetallic compound of FeSn 2 was formed at the interface regardless of the plating conditions. The results showed that the grain size of plated iron decreased with the increased current density and the dissolution thickness of plated iron in molten lead-free solder increased with the increased current density in the <b>rack</b> <b>plating.</b> In the barrel plating, the grain size was rather small in all the test pieces and the dissolution thickness was rather thick. Thus it has been made clear that the dissolution of plated iron in molten lead-free solder is attributable to the grain size of plated iron...|$|R
60|$|I {{must try}} to convey some notion of our life, of how the days passed and what {{pleasure}} we took in them, of what there was {{to do and how}} we set about doing it, in our mountain hermitage. The house, after we had repaired the worst of the damages, and filled in some of the doors and windows with white cotton cloth, became a healthy and a pleasant dwelling-place, always airy and dry, and haunted by the outdoor perfumes of the glen.

Materials and Methods: This trial was conducted at the Experimental unit of Rural Development and extension center, Faculty of animal production, University of Gezira. Twenty four Sudanese desert lambs (Ashgur ecotype) were purchased from local markets to assess the effects of replacing grain with Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris saccharifera) Bulb on feed lot performance, carcass traits under tropical conditions of Sudan. Sugar Beet bulb was incorporated in three rations with a control ration (A: control, B, C, D) at percentages of 0, 11, 22, and 33. Results: The results showed that total weight gain and daily feed intake in group D were significantly different at (P< 0. 05) where values of 5. 59 &# 177; 1. 73 and 0. 94 &# 177; 0. 13 kg were recorded. Total weight gain, daily dry matter intake, daily energy intake and feed conversion ratio were in the range of 10. 67 - 5. 59, 1. 03 - 0. 83, 0. 33 - 0. 27 and 11. 77 - 7. 70 kg respectively. Treatments showed no significant differences at (P< 0. 05) for slaughter weight, empty body weight, dressing % on slaughter weight basis and dressing % on empty weight basis, the obtained results for these traits were 27. 78 - 25. 37, 24. 76 - 22. 22, 45. 80 - 43. 45 % and 51. 41 - 49. 65 %.

40|$|My art {{is based}} on the {{argument}} that visual culture has a profound effect on society, and in turn, on our environment. The radical changes that will be necessary to produce a sustainable society and avoid a future of social inequality and climate catastrophe must be mirrored by equally radical changes in visual culture. These changes involve shifting the sociological sites for art to put culture back into service for the local, participatory communities that are our brightest promise in achieving a sustainable society. In an age beset by unprecedented economic, social, and ecological challenges no problem can be more vital. As plutocracies like the US and India militarize borders to keep out those dangerously tired, hungry and poor from the ravages of climate change, it is our responsibility, as citizens, to do anything we can to prevent these global apartheids. [i] The Anthropocene is a geologic term that describes the current epoch as one in which human activity has encompassing and massively cascading effects on the environment. [ii] The unintended warming of the planet by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is the most salient manifestation of the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene is only defined as such because of the sheer scale of human undertakings. The destructive consequences of the Anthropocene are simultaneously no one’s fault and everyone’s fault. Each of us is a participant in the cumulative effect. In contrast to the seemingly modest mechanisms of climate change, the impacts are already, and will continue to be, huge. It is estimated that 350, 000 people die from climate change related deaths each year. Over the next ten years, it is expected that 5 million will die from the impacts of climate change. [iii] Analogously, the impact of visual culture on human behavior is magnified by the ubiquity of visual media. In art, no one is responsible for the predominant messages of visual culture, which are escapism and diversion. [iv] But when we choose to produce or consume media that do not confront the pressing issues of our day, we are complicit to the process of diversion. The systems of escapism we choose to engage with might seem trivial or lofty, but they produce, when aggregated, a society that can ignore the rampant injustices perpetrated in our name. The destructiveness that characterizes the Anthropocene, like ocean acidification and mass species extinctions, {{is the result of a}} structured alienation between the rhythms and cycles of ecosystems and the constructed habits and desires of human processes. [v] This dissonance requires us to constantly intervene into the earth’s metabolism to synthetically revitalize the land on which we depend. Industrially scaled monocultures are only maintained through ecologically damaging synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified crops. Our interruptions into the organic processes in which the earth replenishes itself is known as the metabolic rift. [vi] The metabolic rift designates both the primary decoupling between ourselves and our environment and the long-range consequences of that originary fission. Soil depletion, caused by monocultures and a lack of crop rotation, are an example of the initial split. The use of synthetic fertilizers, which create dead zones in marine ecosystems and directly damage human health, are a second order consequence of the metabolic rift. And finally, the rising obesity and failing health of a population raised on the processed fruits of GMO monocultures may be seen as a third order consequence of the metabolic rift. [vii] The rift between the needs of the environment and our use of it also has a corollary in art. Western art, like agriculture, has become isolated from metabolic lifecycles. Like the genetically modified corn that covers swaths of the Midwest, art has to be heavily processed before it can be consumed. Anyone can make visual stuff but that raw material is not valued as art until it has thoroughly travailed art’s institutions. To be considered palatable, our society’s art must be encouraged by teachers, accepted into galleries by curators and gallerists, and deemed valid by critics and collectors. The processing of visual works into officiated art strips away intention and value in favor of trends, in the first order, and encourages self-censorship and commodification in the second and third order. It is reflexive to state that visual culture, as an endogenous element of society, has an effect on that society. It can also be conclusively posited that society has consequences on the environment that sustains it. From these premises, we can say that there is a causal link between culture and the environment, via society. From the perspectives of the Anthropocene and the metabolic rift, it is also arguable that the degradation of visual culture is analogous to environmental decimation. If the problems facing art both look like and produce ecological disruptions, it follows that a radical art practice can produce environmental solutions by mimicking those solutions. There are three key elements of viable remedies to the planetary crisis that can easily be applied to art. First, all actions must be taken from a position that is scientifically informed on the consequences of those actions. Secondly, sustainable societies and cultures necessitate a greater level of participation from the public. Finally, we need to suture the metabolic rift by strengthening our local communities. The first step towards sustainability is knowledge. The concept map that forms the foundation of this exhibition is a graphically organized representation of the factors and mechanisms of climate change as described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s authoritative Fourth Assessment Report and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Inventory of U. S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. The sprawling and inclusive network is intended to provide a tool for the analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the problem of climate change. The allegorical characters that act out the concept map are playful visual aids. They emphasize that scientific understanding must be made accessible to the general public to be efficacious. The process of enlightenment must also be accompanied by grassroots participation and organization. This installation is a loose collage of the spaces, events, and goals of a variety of local activist groups. It is arranged as a community center would be, to suggest the potential role activist art can play within local movements. Many of the elements in the installation are participatory (eat some food, take some seedlings, browse the books, or become a propagandist) in order to encourage participation in the activities that inspired the installation. If you agree with the intention of this exhibition, think about joining one (or several) of the local organizations highlighted in it. Many of these organizations directly reduce carbon footprints through lifestyle changes. More importantly, they are working to build the robust movements that can demand climate justice and neutrality. A more informed and active public will naturally repair the metabolic rifts between art and society and society and the environment. My involvement with community groups here in Lincoln is productively and self-sustainingly intertwined with my artistic practice. Many of the objects I produce, such as the ideological <b>plates,</b> propaganda <b>rack,</b> and cycling hats, have been built with a specific organization in mind. Once these objects have been used as art objects, they can be recycled back into functional objects and used to further the goals of the organizations that grew them. These interactive sculptures can then fertilize those grassroots environments and inspire more action. The socio-environmental challenges that we confront, and the urgency with which we face them, are without precedence or comparison. The need to do something, almost anything, to mitigate this headlong disaster has given me an appreciation for the frustrations, imperfections, and humble rewards of grassroots activism, human-powered transportation, and growing one’s own food. In the same fashion, by putting art in service of the ideal of a humane humanity, I have learned to appreciate the simple, ham-handed, and imperfect visual media that characterize movement-building communities. These blemished aesthetics, which have informed my own work, resonate with the local, participatory, and informed communities that are our best hope for the future.

Fusion gene and matrix gene assays {{have been used to}} rapidly detect the NDV isolates. The F gene assay is designed used degenerated oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes with nonfluorescent minor groove binder (MGB) quencher to differentiate lentogenic (low virulent) and velogenic (high virulent) NDVs based on cleavage site of the F 0 precursor of fusion protein gene which is a key determinant of NDV pathogenicity. ### Introduction Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating disease of birds caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian paramyxoviruses (AMPV), which is classified into Avulavirus genus and paramyxoviridae family of the order Mononegavirales (1). The paramyxoviridae encompasses a diverse group of viruses consist of a negative sense single-stranded, non-segmented RNA molecule. The disease is complicated due to different pathotypes and strains of the virus that may induce enormous variation in the severity of disease characterized by fatal respiratory and neurological pathogenesis. Nucleotide sequencing of the NDV genome has encoding six proteins including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), fusion protein (F), necleocapsid protein (NP), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (L) (2). Accurate and rapid diagnosis of an outbreak and prompt detection and differentiation of lentogenic/mesogenic/velogenic NDVs are important. One of the rapid detection strategy used to avoid post amplification processing is to utilize real time reverse transcription rRT-PCT techniques. The advantages of such assay based on the fluorogenic hydrolysis of probes that result can be obtained within 2 hours. AMPV- 1 detection rRT-PCR assay was employed in USA during the ND outbreaks of 2002 - 2003, described by Wise et al. (2004) (3). Both the probes and primers reported were validated on lentogenic, mesogenic and velogenic strains circulating in the USA. However those protocols do not detect all NDV strains due to significantly genetic distance between AMPV- 1 isolates. Furthermore, {{it has been reported that}} the matrix gene is not truly conserved and probability of false negative occur and in addition matrix gene based rRT-PCR is generally used for the screening test of AMPV- 1 but does not discriminates its pathotypes or not for the confirmation of ND outbreaks (4). However, fusion gene based rRT-PCR assay is useful as it would allow for quick detection and pathotyping. ### Materials 1. Invitrogen SuperScript™III Platinum® One-Step Quantitative Kit - Forward and reverse primers (10 μM) - Dual-labeled probes (10 μM) - Positive control RNAs - Molecular grade sterile distilled water (RNase and DNase free) ### Equipment 1. Vortex - Microfuge - Nanodrop 2000 / 2000 c spectrophotometer - Centrifuge - Biological safety cabinet - Applied BiosystemsTM real-time PCR systems 7500 ### Procedure Preparation 1. Avoiding sample contamination: Special precautions should be taken to avoid false positive amplifications. The following must be recommended: - A) Separate areas setup must be maintain, especially handling with RNA - B) Wear powder free gloves is strongly recommended when handing with nucleic acid especially RNA and must be change whenever you guess they may be contaminated and wear clean lab coat when setting up assays. - C) Keep all reagent tubes capped - D) Biological safety cabinet maintain clean and protected from all types contaminations - Equipment preparation: All equipments including centrifuge, microfuge, vertex and work surface areas should be clean and must be use cleaning products such as 70 % ethanol, 5 % bleach and DNAzap™ or RNase AWAY® to minimize any risk of contamination. - Reagent preparation - A) Sample/Specimens processing: Tracheal tissues from morbid birds tested for the isolation of NDV after passaging into 9 - 10 day old chicken embryonated eggs and positive for NDV were selected by spot HA test. Swab specimens must be collected with a synthetic tip (such as polyester or Dacron®) and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Swabs with cotton tips and wooden shafts are not recommended. - B) Nucleic acid extraction: Amount and quality of template RNA is an important appliance whenever RT-PCR amplification assay is accomplished. Sample extraction is carried out through manually by Trizol method or commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits are available to generate highly purified RNA. The following reagents are needed: - 1. TriZol® LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA, USA) - 2. Chloroform - 3. Isopropanol - 4. Ethanol (90 - 100 %) - The following steps are carried out by Trizol method - i) A total volume of 250 uL of Allanto-amniotic fluids (AAF) was collected to a 1. 5 mL eppendorff and adds 750 uL of Trizol and the sample is overtax for 15 second. The eppendorff is then incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes. - ii) Pulse spanned to remove the liquid from the tune lid. - iii) Add 250 uL 100 % chloroform to the sample, vortex for 15 second and then again incubate at room temperature for 7 minutes. - iv) After incubation, centrifuge is carried out at 12, 000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature. - v) New eppendorff tubes were labeled according to the corresponding number. - vi) Transfer 450 uL of upper equeous layer to a new eppendorff tube. - vii) Add 500 uL 100 % isopropanol, inverted tubes several times to mixed and hold them at room temperature for 10 minutes. - viii) Discard supernatant. - ix) Add 1 mL of 80 % ethanol to the pellet and mixed gently. - x) The tubes were then centrifuge at 10, 000 g for 5 minutes at 4 ºC. - xi) Ethanol was discarded and inverted the tube on a clean tissue wipe and allow to air dried for 10 minutes. (It is important not to let the RNA pellet over dry as this will decrease its solubility). - xii) 50 uL of RNase free water was added to pellet and briefly vortex to resuspend pellet. - C) Primers and probes Thaw frozen aliquots of probes and primers or must be vertex or briefly centrifuge and then place in cold rack. - Tests for each rRT-PCR run - i) Each extracted RNA samples is tested for each targeted probe/primer set. - ii) No-template controls (NTC) and positive template control (PTC) for all probe/primer set must be included in each run. Reaction setup: 96 well reactions plate is recommended for reaction assay mixture. - 1. The reaction mixture is highly recommended to prepare in 1. 5 mL eppendorff tube for each probe/primer set except the template added separately to each tube. - 2. Determine the number of reactions (N) per assay and must make excess reaction volume to reduce pipetting error. e. g. if number of samples (n) including control = 1 to 20, then N = n+ 1 - 3. Calculated each reagent to be added for each assay. The calculation should be as follows, - Reagents and volume for a single reaction For n reactions - 1 X nX - Template 5. 0 μl - - 2 X PCR Master Mix 12. 5 μl N x 12. 5 μl - RT Mix 0. 5 μl N x 1. 0 μl - Forward primer (0. 8 μM final concentration) 0. 5 μl N x 0. 5 μl - Reverse primer (0. 8 μM final concentration) 0. 5 μl N x 0. 5 μl - Probe (0. 2 μM final concentration) 0. 5 μl N x 0. 5 μl - Nuclease free water 5. 5 μl N x 5. 0 μl - Total volume 25. 0 μl N x 25. 0 μl - The reagents added in 1. 5 mL eppendorff tube must be mixed properly or centrifuge for 5 seconds and recommended do not vertex it. - Set up 96 well <b>plate</b> in cold <b>rack</b> - Dispense 20 µL of each master mix into each well of 96 wells plate and samples can be added by column. Pipette 5 µL samples into all the wells labeled for that sample and be careful to change the tip after each addition. - Set up the NTC reaction for last column of each row and pipette 5 µL of nuclease free water into the NTC well instead of template. - Pipette 5 µL positive template control RNA into all PTC wells - Cover the 96 well reaction plate - It is highly recommended to change the gloves when necessary to avoid contamination. - If using 8 tube strips, do not label the strip on top of the tube. - Briefly centrifuge plate or tube stripes for 5 to 10 seconds and return to cold rack. - RT-PCR amplification conditions: - The reaction volume is 25 μl. Program the thermocycler as follows: - Reverse Transcription (RT step) 50 °C for 30 min - Taq inhibitor inactivation 95 °C for 2 min - PCR amplification (45 cycles) 95 °C for 15 sec - 60 °C for 30 sec# - #Fluorescence data (FAM) should be collected during the 60 °C incubation step. EVALUATION AND VALIDATION of rRT-PCR A) Sensitivity: Three ways have been used to determine the sensitivity - i) Determination of limit of detection (LOD) : 10 fold dilutions of viral suspension with a known TCID 50 in Specific Pathogenic Free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs of age 9 - 11 days were assayed. The LOD was determined by the highest dilution that gives a significant Ct value. 2. 0 % gel was used for the confirmation of amplicons using Gel Documentation System (BioRad, Austerlia). - ii) Determination of cut-off: 10 fold dilution of RNA from positive control were analyzed in each rRT-PCR. The cut-off was determined as the highest dilution that gives a Ct value. 2. 0 % gel was used for the confirmation of amplicons using Gel Documentation System (BioRad, Austerlia). - iii) Copy number determination (CN) : The target gene of class I and II NDV was amplified and subsequently purified using PureLink Gel purification kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s recommendation. 10 fold dilution of the purified product was then test in the rRT-PCR with or without reverse transcription stage. The lowest concentration of nucleic acid detected corresponds to the copy number detected by rRT-PCT. B) Specificity: - i) Two ways have been used to determine the specificity: Nucleic acid extract from Newcastle disease virus was tested in all rRT-PCR being evaluated. The specificity is determine as the rRT-PCR is assessed as specific if only NDV nucleic acid react in the reaction - ii) rRT-PCR was assayed using nucleic acid from known class of NDVs. The rRT-PCR is assessed as specific if it identified only the class of NDV for which it was designed. LIMITATIONS: 1. Analysts should be trained and familiar with testing procedures and interpretation of results prior to performing the assay. - A false negative result may occur if inadequate numbers of organisms are present in the specimen due to improper collection, transport or handling. - A false negative result may occur if an excess of RNA template is present in the reaction. Extracted RNA can be tested at 2 or more dilutions (e. g. 1 : 10 and 1 : 100) to verify the resu ### Timing - RNA Extraction: 1 : 30 hour - cDNA synthesis: 2 hours - Real-time PCR: 2 hours - Dissociation curve analysis: 0. 3 hour ### Troublshooting - No PCR product: Low templates quality is the major reason, poor quality of primers and any PCR reagents may also lead to reaction failures. To eliminate these possibilities, should be including appropriate PCR controls to overcome these troubles. - Low PCR amplification efficiency: Ideally the PCR efficiency should be close to 100 %, meaning PCR products double during each cycle, below 100 % mean poor reaction conditions. Poor primer quality or bad chemistry is the leading cause of poor PCR efficiency. Furthermore, if the PCR efficiency is above 100 % may be due to amplification of non-specific products, primer dimers or inhibitor in the standard. - Non-specific PCR amplicons: Non-specific PCR identified both by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. To avoid this problem, please make sure to perform hot-start PCR and use at least 60 C annealing temperature. If the non-specific amplicon is persistent, you have to choose a different primer pair for the gene of interest. ### Anticipated Results 1. All the tested clinical samples should be exhibited fluorescence growth curve that cross the threshold line. If the curve across the threshold line before 35 cycles indicating the presence of sufficient targeted template. - The NTC reactions must not exhibit fluorescence growth curve that cross the threshold line. If it exhibited a growth curve across the threshold line, sample contamination may have occurred. - PTC reaction must produce a positive result between 20 - 30 cycles. ### References 1. Alexander DJ.
