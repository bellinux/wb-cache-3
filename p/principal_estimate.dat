40|$|AbstractTo gain {{perspective}} {{on the use of}} tandem mass spectral libraries for identification of toxic cyclic peptides, the new library was built from 263 mass spectra (mainly MS 2 spectra) of 59 compounds of that group, such as microcystins, amatoxins, and some related compounds. Mass spectra were extracted from the literature or specially acquired on ESI-Q-ToF and MALDI-ToF/ToF tandem instruments. ESI-MS 2 product-ion mass spectra appeared to be rather close to MALDI-ToF/ToF fragment spectra which are uncommon for mass spectral libraries. Testing of the library was based on searches where reference spectra were in turn cross-compared. The percentage of 1 st rank correct identifications (true positives) was 70 % in a general case and 88 – 91 % without including knowingly defective (‘one-dimension’) spectra as test ones. The percentage of 88 – 91 % is the <b>principal</b> <b>estimate</b> for the overall performance of this library {{that can be used in}} a method of choice for identification of individual cyclopeptides and also for group recognition of individual classes of such peptides. The approach to identification of cyclopeptides based on mass spectral library matching proved to be the most effective for abundant toxins.

40|$|Background: Forest, grass, and peat fires release {{approximately}} 2 petagrams {{of carbon}} {{into the atmosphere}} each year, influencing weather, climate, and air quality. Objective: We estimated the annual global mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke (LFS). Methods: Daily and annual exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2. 5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5) from fire emissions was estimated globally for 1997 through 2006 by combining outputs from a chemical transport model with satellite-based observations of aerosol optical depth. In World Health Organization (WHO) subregions classified as sporadically affected, the daily burden of mortality was estimated using previously published concentration–response coefficients for the association between short-term elevations in PM 2. 5 from LFS (contrasted with 0 μg/m 3 from LFS) and all-cause mortality. In subregions classified as chronically affected, the annual burden of mortality was estimated using the American Cancer Society study coefficient for the association between long-term PM 2. 5 exposure and all-cause mortality. The annual average PM 2. 5 estimates were contrasted with theoretical minimum (counterfactual) concentrations in each chronically affected subregion. Sensitivity of mortality estimates to different exposure assessments, counterfactual estimates, and concentration–response functions was evaluated. Strong La Niña and El Niño years were compared to assess the influence of interannual climatic variability. Results: Our <b>principal</b> <b>estimate</b> for the average mortality attributable to LFS exposure was 339, 000 deaths annually. In sensitivity analyses the interquartile range of all tested estimates was 260, 000 – 600, 000. The regions most affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157, 000) and Southeast Asia (110, 000). Estimated annual mortality during La Niña was 262, 000, compared with 532, 000 during El Niño. Conclusions: Fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality. Adverse health outcomes associated with LFS could be substantially reduced by curtailing burning of tropical rainforests, which rarely burn naturally. The large estimated influence of El Niño suggests a relationship between climate and the burden of mortality attributable to LFS...|$|E

40|$|Today, boys {{generally}} underperform {{relative to}} girls in schools throughout the industrialized world.

As a consequence, boys are more sensitive than girls to school resources that create a learning-oriented environment.

The current school attendance by a child has a large, negative impact on her labour hours, thus, pointing to compulsory schooling as an effective instrument in reducing child labour.

We need to delimit the extent of long-range transport that significantly contributes to deposition and thus loadings.
