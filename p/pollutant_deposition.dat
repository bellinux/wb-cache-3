5000|$|According to the U.S. Forest Service {{the use of}} old-style {{two-stroke}} engines, previously {{common in}} vehicles designed for off-road use, also causes concerns about pollution. This is because [...] "two-stroke engines emit about 20 to 33 percent of the consumed fuel through the exhaust" [...] (as the engine lubricant is a [...] "total loss system" [...] and is emitted by design) and [...] "discharge from two-stroke snowmobile engines can lead to indirect <b>pollutant</b> <b>deposition</b> into {{the top layer of}} snow and subsequently into the associated surface and ground water".|$|E

3000|$|The {{degree of}} {{efficiency}} deterioration depends on the specific mass and size of dust particles deposition on PV module surface.

The different <b>pollutant</b> <b>depositions</b> may include red soil, ash, sand, calcium carbonate, silica, etc. The presence of air pollution may significantly deteriorate the energy yield of PV panels; even after a short period of the panels’ outdoor exposure (e.g., 2  months) without cleaning, it may cause a decrement of 6.5 % in energy production approximately (Sarver et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD) {{shade tree}} program {{will result in}} the {{planting}} of 500, 000 trees and has been found to produce net benefits from air conditioning savings. In this study we assume three scenarios (base, highest, and lowest benefits) based on the SMUD program and apply Best Available Control Technology (BACT) cost analysis to determine if shade trees planted in residential yards can be a cost effective means to improve air quality. Planting and maintenance osts, <b>pollutant</b> <b>deposition,</b> and biogenic hydrocarbon emissions are estimated annually for 30 years with existing deterministic models, For the base case, the average annual dollar benefit of pollutant uptake was $ 895 and the cost of biogenic hydrocarbon emissions was $ 512, for a net pollutant uptake benefit of $ 383 per 100 trees planted. The uniform annual payment necessary to repay planting and maintenance osts with a 10 % rate of interest was $ 749. When high biogenic hydrocarbon emitting tree species were replaced with low-emitters, the base case benefit-cost ratio (BCR) increased from 0. 5 : 1 to 0. 9 : 1. The BCR for the "highest " and "lowest " benefit cases were 2. 2 : 1 and- 0. 8 : 1, respectively. Although SMUD plantings produce cost effective nergy savings, our application of the BACT analysis does not suggest convincing evidence that there is cost savings when only air quality benefits are considered.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} evaluation of wood chemical components for some tree species {{in a forest}} area from east-northern Romania is presented here, through a comparative study from 1964 to 2000. Investigation upon the wood tree-rings in a Quercus robur L. tree species, as a dominant species, as regards its chemical composition {{and structure of the}} natural polymer constituents - cellulose and lignin - was also performed through chemical methods to separate the main wood components, FT-IR spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. Having in view the impact of climate and external factors (such as <b>pollutant</b> <b>depositions),</b> some possible correlations between wood chemical composition and its further use can be made. The FT-IR spectra give evidence of differences in the frequency domains of 3400 - 2900 cm- 1 and 1730 - 1640 cm- 1, due to some interactions between the chemical groups (OH, C=O). The crystallinity index of cellulose presents variations in the oak wood tree-rings. Thermogravimetry analyses show different behaviour of cellulose at thermal decomposition, as a function of radial growth and tree’s height. A preliminary chemical investigation of oak wood sawdust shows a relatively high content of mineral elements (ash), compared with a previous study performed in 1964, fact that may indicate an intense drying process of the oak tree, a general phenomenon present in European forests for this species...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of aerosol {{deposition}} in the respiratory system {{is important for}} improving the efficiency of inhaled drug delivery and for assessing the toxicity of airborne <b>pollutants.</b> <b>Deposition</b> is typically reported {{as a function of}} a global Stokes number which is based on a reference flow timescale, or the ratio of the characteristic flow length and velocity scales. In reality however, particles experience varying flow timescales as they are advected through the airways, which motivates the use of an instantaneous Stokes number based on the local properties of the flow field. We then define the effective Stokes number as the time-average of the instantaneous value. This effective Stokes number thus encapsulates the flow history and geometric variability, and provides a more detailed account of the particle trajectory in the flow. Laminar and turbulent flows in a curved pipe are examined first and provide a simplified, or canonical, configuration of the flow in the upper airways. They are followed by a study of turbulent flow in an idealized mouth-throat geometry. Our results demonstrate that the effective Stokes number can deviate significantly from the traditional value based solely on the reference flow timescale. In addition, the effective Stokes number shows a clear correlation with deposition efficiency and can therefore be used to determine optimal aerosol release locations in order to minimize extrathoracic losses...|$|R
40|$|Concern exists {{over the}} effects of {{interacting}} environmental stresses on the ecological integrity of temperate forests. Coincidence of sensitivity to drought, increasing occurrence of defoliation, and elevated <b>pollutant</b> <b>deposition</b> has produced speculation that northern hardwood forests may be susceptible to the increased climatic stresses projected for the Great Lakes region. The objective of our {{study was to examine}} relationships among environmental stress factors, vigor, mortality, and growth in northern hardwood forests located along a pollution-climate gradient in the Great Lakes region. Between 1987 and 1993, we quantified climatic variables, <b>pollutant</b> <b>deposition,</b> insect defoliation, and tree vigor and growth at five sites along this gradient. Drought and defoliation occurred to varying degrees during the study period. Symptoms of chronic environmental stress, such as cankers and epicormic branching, were most pronounced at extreme ends of the gradient. Periodic diameter increments decreased for suppressed trees but increased for dominant trees from north to south, primarily related to climatic factors. Variation in annual diameter increments was strongly associated with moisture availability, with diameter growth being greatly reduced during episodic droughts at the more southerly sites. At one site that experienced both drought and defoliation in 1988, worsening crown condition, elevated mortality, and reduced growth were consistent with {{the effects of}} acute levels of environmental stress. While most northern hardwood forests in the Great Lakes region are currently healthy, our results provide additional evidence that these forests are sensitive to increased severity of environmental stress, and may experience alterations in mortality and growth if climate changes as some have predicted...|$|E
