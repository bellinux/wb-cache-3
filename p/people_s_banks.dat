40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is two-fold. First, I present a {{detailed}} {{overview of the}} setup and conduction of monetary policy in China. I describe the most important participants, the goals and instruments, and discuss the concepts of independence and transparency in a Chinese setting. I show that conduction of monetary policy in China {{has come a long}} way from the Mao-era when the <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Bank</b> of China (PBC) operated as a department of the Ministry of Finance, and the central authorities managed all financial transaction over the state budget. However, in terms of independence the ties between the central bank, other ministries and the China Communist Party are still tight and the areas of responsibility are vaguely defined. In addition, several commercial market participants have close ties to the government and should also be considered as important for the conduction of monetary policy. In sum, I argue that, the PBC cannot be regarded an independent central bank. Furthermore, even though the mandate of monetary policy is given in the law on <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Bank</b> of China, it is not clear how this mandate is integrated in the every-day decision making. In this thesis, I argue that the PBC operates under a two-fold policy goal of price stability and economic growth in the short run, but that it lacks one long-run inflation target rate. Instead, the State Council sets targets for both the inflation rate and the economic growth annually. I argue that these targets must be regarded as maximum and minimum levels respectively. I also show that the PBC officially considers the monetary aggregate, M 2, as the intermediate target of monetary policy. The second part of this thesis is an empirical analysis of the conduction of monetary policy in China. As a bridge between the two parts I present a recap on the theoretical background of the inflation bias as presented by Barro and Gordon (1983). Barro and Gordon (1983) and later literature show that a positive inflation bias could evolve in the economy as a consequence of the central <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> wish to stabilize growth around a level that exceeds the natural level of growth. My empirical analysis describes the difficulties in measuring inflation in an emerging economy as the Chinese one. By the use of available data, I show that the Chinese households must me regarded increasingly rational when forming their inflation expectations. Moreover, I argue that it seems like the general public finds the PBC credible, and the inflation expectations seems to follow the development in the annual inflation targets defined by the State Council. Finally, I make use of both official statistics on the inflation rate and the market s inflation expectations to search for a positive inflation bias in the Chinese economy. I show that the realized inflation in China has exceeded the inflation target for about 35 percent of the time since 1996. I argue that, even though my description of the conduction of monetary policy in China shows that many of the necessary conditions for inflation bias to evolve are fulfilled, this is a too little share of time to conclude that such inflation bias is present in the Chinese economy. Nonetheless, I show that the inflation rate has been highly volatile over the same period, both compared to inflation in other countries and to domestic economic growth. I argue that this could indicate that the PBC places a majority of the weight on output when conducting monetary policy. In this thesis, I also present possible steps forward for the conduction of monetary policy in China that could create a more stable inflation rate and avoid the future possibility for a positive inflation bias in the Chinese economy. Most importantly, I argue that replacing the constantly shifting inflation target by a medium- or long term constant inflation rate would make the Chinese monetary policy more predictable, and if communicated the right way increase the transparency of the conduction of monetary policy. The cost will be a somewhat higher volatility in output growth. On the other side, the gain will be a much more stable inflation rate in the long run, which in itself could lead to higher growth as it makes it easier for the general public to form their expectations about future inflation...|$|R
40|$|Using U. <b>S.</b> {{cross-border}} <b>bank</b> exposure data, {{this study}} establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks,</b> via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the across-the-board, increasing volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing international exposures of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> balance sheets since the mid- 1980 <b>s.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile flows to {{other regions of}} the world. In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> cross-border and local claims. The cross-border claims of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> on European customers tend to be procyclical. By contrast, locally generated and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are not robustly related to either U. S. or country-specific business cycle variables.

S. issuing firm that includes a U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> in its underwriting syndicate can expect to have its offering underpriced by 17. 7 percentage points less than had it not included a U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> in the syndicate.

Empirical results with respect to separate analyses of large European and U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are strikingly similar with decreasing (increasing) cost (profit) returns to scale.

Further analyses evaluate the reasonableness of estimating a combined cost or profit frontier for European and U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> We find that, while a single profit frontier may exist, separate cost frontiers are implied. Although profitability in absolute terms is equal, large U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to exhibit higher average profit efficiency than European banks on average. Moreover, banks in the U.

40|$|U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> {{have long}} faced {{restrictions}} {{imposed by the}} Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. This act erected barriers between commercial and investment banking. Although the barriers have been eroding recently, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> system is still considered restrictive compared with countries that permit banks to perform {{a broad range of}} financial services (i. e., universal banking). As banking becomes increasingly global, this regulatory difference faced by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> becomes more important in that it selectively handicaps U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> and forces them to become more competitive so that they can continue to deliver a comprehensive package of financial products to their corporate customers. In their efforts to become more competitive, coordination and structuring of foreign operations are key strategic tools. For example, foreign branches and subsidiaries have different capabilities and costs. So the choice of organizational form preferences (branches versus subsidiaries) in host countries can affect the global reach and competitiveness of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks.</b> In this study, therefore, we examined how U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> structure their foreign operations. Specifically, we tested the influence of host countries' banking (financial) system development and regulations on U. S. banks' organizational form preferences (the combination of branches and subsidiaries established by a bank in a host country). We found that a bank's size, globalization, product diversity, and charter value influence organizational form preferences within and across different host-country banking environments. Our results are consistent with the concept of natural adaptation and flexibility, or in this case, "banking environment" flexibility. ...|$|R

The results indicate that the {{tax exemptions}} to Subchapter <b>S</b> <b>banks</b> do not create new jobs, and that the owners of the bank are the sole beneficiary of the tax exemptions since there is a significant increase in bank’s return on equity after it adopts the Subchapter S status.
