50|$|Recombination {{usually take}} place in the whole volume of a plasma (volume recombination), {{although}} in some cases it is confined to some special region of it. Each kind of reaction is called a recombining mode and their individual rates are strongly affected by the properties of the plasma such as its energy (heat), density of each species, pressure and temperature of the surrounding environment. An everyday example of rapid <b>plasma</b> <b>recombination</b> occurs when a fluorescent lamp is switched off. The low-density plasma in the lamp (which generates the light by bombardment of the fluorescent coating {{on the inside of the}} glass wall) recombines in a fraction of a second after the plasma-generating electric field is removed by switching off the electric power source.|$|E
