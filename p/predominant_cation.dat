Metastable solid solutions formed at 25 °C which are not predicted from the extrapolation of higher temperature equilibrium assemblages; instead, solids formed that were intermediary in chemical composition to known magnesite-siderite and dolomite solid solutions. A calcite-siderite solid solution precipitated at 25 °C, with the percentage of CaCO 3 in the solid being proportional to the aqueous Ca/Fe ratio of the solution, while Mg was excluded from the crystal structure except at relatively high aqueous Mg/Ca and Mg/Fe ratios and a low Ca content.

40|$|Silica {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{foulants}} in desalination of brackish water. Its presence limits the water recovery and in addition once foulant is formed, the removal and cleaning is almost imposs~le. Therefore, the aim is to prevent silica fouling from the inception.

Usually, there is a prelreatment stage for removing as much silica as possible prior to the actual desalination step. It is of great importance to know the effect of most <b>predominant</b> <b>cations</b> and anions on the polymerization and hence tailoring the pretreatment stage to emphasize the removal of most troublesome components.

The study objective was to use different methods to quantify Al in soils from toposequences formed from material of a sedimentary nature originating from the Solimões Formation, in Acre, Brazil. Trenches were opened at three distinct points in the landscape: shoulder, backslope and footslope positions. Soil samples were collected for physical, chemical, mineralogical analyses.

40|$|ABSTRACT Surface water {{treated to}} {{drinking}} water standards offers several important advantages over treated groundwater {{as a source}} of recharge to Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) wells screened in confined, sandy aquifers. In confined aquifers comprised of a quartz sand matrix, pore water chemistry is often controlled by metal bearing-, and clay minerals. Successful ASR operations are often dependent on stabilizing these minerals in situ. Surface water typically exhibits a relatively neutral pH that can be easily adjusted according to the geochemistry of the storage aquifer. In fresh surface waters away from coastal areas, calcium is the <b>predominant</b> <b>cation,</b> and is beneficial for stabilizing clay minerals in the storage aquifer. Surface water typically contains near saturation concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) which is beneficial for initiating the oxidation of common reduced-state, iron bearing minerals like pyTite and siderite. With the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to oxygenated recharge water to control pH, iron-bearing mineral minerals can be rapidly stabilized by the formation of ferric hydroxide precipitate coatings. These coatings isolate the mineral from further reaction with the aquifer environment and are highly sorptive of metal ions migrating in the aquifer environment. In the absence of DO, oxidation reactions are not initiated, and dissolved iron concentrations in the stored water reach equilibrium with the surrounding mineralogy. Drawbacks to the use of treated surface water {{as a source of}} recharge include elevated concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total trihalomethanes (THM), and haloacetic acids (HAA). In confined storage aquifers, THM concentrations decline to 20 to 50 percent of their original concentration after several weeks of storage, with the degradation of brominated forms preceding chlorinated species. However, these rapid reductions in concentration moderate over several operational cycles, as the aquifer matrix is repeatedly oxidized...|$|E
40|$|Human heart Na+ {{channels}} {{were expressed}} transiently in both mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes, and Na+ currents measured using 150 mM intracellular Na+. The kinetics of decaying outward Na+ current {{in response to}} 1 -s depolarizations in the F 1485 Q mutant depends on the <b>predominant</b> <b>cation</b> in the extracellular solution, suggesting an effect on slow inactivation. The decay rate is lower for the alkali metal cations Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ than for the organic cations Tris, tetramethylammonium, N-methylglucamine, and choline. In whole cell recordings, raising [Na+]o from 10 to 150 mM increases the rate of recovery from slow inactivation at − 140 mV, decreases the rate of slow inactivation at relatively depolarized voltages, and shifts steady-state slow inactivation in a depolarized direction. Single channel recordings of F 1485 Q show {{a decrease in the}} number of blank (i. e., null) records when [Na+]o is increased. Significant clustering of blank records when depolarizing at a frequency of 0. 5 Hz suggests that periods of inactivity represent the sojourn of a channel in a slow-inactivated state. Examination of the single channel kinetics at + 60 mV during 90 -ms depolarizations shows that neither open time, closed time, nor first latency is significantly affected by [Na+]o. However raising [Na+]o decreases the duration of the last closed interval terminated by the end of the depolarization, leading to an increased number of openings at the depolarized voltage. Analysis of single channel data indicates that at a depolarized voltage a single rate constant for entry into a slow-inactivated state is reduced in high [Na+]o, suggesting that the binding of an alkali metal cation, perhaps in the ion-conducting pore, inhibits the closing of the slow inactivation gate...|$|E
40|$|The B horizons of {{terra rossa}} soils {{developed}} on three different carbonate lithologies having variable insoluble residue contents were studied in Western Herzegovina. Comparison of  their composition and properties illustrates {{to what extent}} mineral (especially clay mineral assemblage) and particle size composition of those horizons and the insoluble residue of the underlying carbonate rocks {{can be used as}} indicators of the polygenetic nature of terra rossa in this region. Terra rossa B horizons have characteristic red colours, neutral to slightly acid pH, high base saturation with calcium as the <b>predominant</b> <b>cation</b> and high CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration). The CIA values obtained are generally in accordance with mineral composition and particle size distribution of the analysed B horizons.  The predominant clay mineral phases in B horizons and related insoluble residues match. Kaolinite is the predominant clay mineral phase in the B horizons overlying carbonate rocks containing low amounts of insoluble residue, while smectite predominates in calcarenites areas with a high insoluble residue content.  However, the presence of plagioclase, gibbsite, chlorite-vermiculite mixed layer mineral and vermiculite in B horizons overlying carbonate rocks containing low amounts of insoluble residue support a polygenetic origin for the terra rossa. In contrast, terra rossa formed on calcarenites containing high amounts of insoluble residue might have formed almost exclusively from the parent carbonate rock although some influence of external materials (e. g. gibbsite) cannot be excluded. This investigation shows that in Western Herzegovina, an area with no important aeolian input, the content and mineral composition of carbonate rock insoluble residue {{plays a major role in}} terra rossa composition.  We can tentatively conclude that the lower the insoluble residue content of the parent materials, the greater is the expectation of a more polygenetic origin for the terra rossa...|$|E
40|$|Bauxite residue, {{a highly}} {{alkaline}} solid waste, is extremely hazardous {{to the surrounding}} environment and current research approaches have largely focused on the removal and separation of alkaline substances. Natural weathering processes may be a step forward {{in terms of their}} regeneration. In this study, natural evolution of basic alkalinity, electrical conductivity, exchangeable ions and acid neutralizing capacity of residue in the disposal areas was discussed. Minerals, exchangeable cations and alkaline anions were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and titration, respectively. Acid neutralizing capacity was carried out by batch neutralization experiments. Basic alkalinity, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable sodium percentage decreased with increasing disposal duration. Sodium was the <b>predominant</b> exchangeable <b>cation</b> in fresh residue but its concentration significantly decreased with increasing time from initial disposal. The acid neutralizing capacity of bauxite residue was investigated by incubation with hydrochloric acid. Acid neutralizing capacity curves changed with disposal duration and each revealed a characteristic buffering behavior that could be controlled by its alkaline components...|$|R
40|$|Hyponatremia is {{the most}} common {{electrolyte}} disorder in clinical practice and is associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients. Sodium is the <b>predominant</b> extracellular <b>cation</b> and, together with its anion chloride, constitutes most of the osmoles in the extracellular space. In the presence of an intact thirst sensation, serum osmolality is set by the mechanisms of salt and water homeostasis to ~ 280 - 290 mOsm/kg. Hyponatremia results from excess of free water more often than from lack of salt. Free water clearance is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone and depends on adequate delivery of solute to the diluting segments of the nephron. Analysis of hyponatremia is best performed in a systematic manner, taking into account measured or calculated serum osmolality and the volume state as assessed clinically. Urinary osmolality and sodium concentration may facilitate the differential diagnosis. Therapy of hyponatremia should aim at correcting the underlying disorder. Only in severe, symptomatic hyponatremia should hypertonic saline be infused, in which case care should be taken to avoid complications such as osmotic demyelination...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In soils of {{tropical}} climate regions the high acidity {{and the presence}} of exchangeable aluminum (Al 3 +), associated to low fertility, are the main restrainting factors for agricultural production. A laboratory experiment was conducted using 26 soils of different Brazilian regions, to investigate soil acidity components, giving emphasis to Al and their relations with chemical properties. The pH correlated positively with P, Ca, Mg, K, BS, CEC and V % values, and negatively with Al saturation. The Al 3 + was the <b>predominant</b> exchangeable <b>cation</b> in 32 % of the soils with pH below 5. 6. The KCl titratable H+ represents the hydroxi-Al(OH) x complex with low stability and the Wolf-Morgan extracted Al corresponds to the exchangeable + non-exchangeable Al species. The Al 3 + and low stability hydroxi-Al decreased quickly with increasing pH up to 5. 5. The non-exchangeable Al increased up to pH 4. 5, then decreased to pH 5. 5 and had a small increment from 7. 0 to 7. 5. Key words: total acidity, exchangeable acidity, pH, aluminum in soil RELAÇÕES ENTRE ACIDEZ E PROPRIEDADES QUÍMICAS DE SOLOS BRASILEIROS RESUMO: Nos solos de regiões de clima tropical, a elevada acidez e a presença de alumínio trocável (Al 3 +), aliadas à baixa fertilidade, são os principais fatores a restringir a produção agrícola.
