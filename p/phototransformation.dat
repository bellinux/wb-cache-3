In “direct” <b>phototransformation,</b> photons are {{absorbed by the}} contaminant, while in “indirect” <b>phototransformation,</b> reactive species are formed through photon absorption by other substances. Pesticide electronic absorption spectra typically show little overlap with sunlight, such {{that only a few}} (e.g., trifluralin) are affected by direct <b>phototransformation.</b> Various photochemically active light absorbers are present in surface waters, enhancing indirect <b>phototransformation.</b> The most prominent is dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is the precursor of excited triplet states, molecular oxygen, superoxide radical anions, and other radicals. Nitrate and nitrite ions produce hydroxyl radicals under irradiation. Indirect <b>phototransformation</b> is thus the result of parallel reactions with all available reactive species. The transformation rate depends on the concentrations of all relevant reactive species, together with their corresponding second-order rate constants for a given pesticide. These constants are known for hydroxyl radical and molecular oxygen. In the absence of such rate constants, quantitative structure-activity relationships(QSARs) may allow their estimation for a specific pesticide from its chemical structure.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} UV radiation exposure time on abiotic transformations of leachates from 2 aquatic macrophytes: Phragmites australis and Hydrocaris morsus-ranae. In addition, we studied the influence of <b>phototransformations</b> of DOM on bacterial growth. Sterile filtered leachates were exposed to UV radiation for 5, 10, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h or kept in the dark. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), hydrogen peroxide and low molecular weight carboxylic acids (oxalic, formic, malonic and acetic acids) were measured. After UV or dark treatment, the leachates were inoculated with bacteria and incubated in the dark. Based on the observed DIC and hydrogen per oxide formation rates, we concluded that <b>phototransformations</b> are initially more rapid in H. morsus-ranae DOM than in P. australis DOM. On the other hand, production of DIC after more than 48 h of UV exposure was strongly reduced for H. morsus-ranae DOM, whereas DIC production was only slightly reduced for P. australis DOM. The differences in the photoreactivity between DOM from P. australis and H. morsus-ranae DOM {{were also reflected in}} the bacterial growth response to DOM <b>phototransformations.</b> The lowest bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) were found in the irradiated leachate of P, australis exposed for more than 48 h and in the irradiated leachate of H, morsus-ranae exposed for 10 h, which coincided with the highest concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for both types of leachates...|$|R
40|$|Photoactivatable {{fluorescent}} proteins (FPs) {{are powerful}} fluorescent highlighters in live cell imaging and offer perspectives for optical nanoscopy {{and the development}} of biophotonic devices. Two types of photoactivation are currently being distinguished, reversible photoswitching between fluorescent and nonfluorescent forms and irreversible photoconversion. Here, we have combined crystallography and (in crystallo) spectroscopy to characterize the Phe- 173 -Ser mutant of the tetrameric variant of EosFP, named IrisFP, which incorporates both types of <b>phototransformations.</b> In its green fluorescent state, IrisFP displays reversible photoswitching, which involves cis–trans isomerization of the chromophore. Like its parent protein EosFP, IrisFP also photoconverts irreversibly to a red-emitting state under violet light because of an extension of the conjugated ?-electron system of the chromophore, accompanied by a cleavage of the polypeptide backbone. The red form of IrisFP exhibits a second reversible photoswitching process, which may also involve cis–trans isomerization of the chromophore. Therefore, IrisFP displays altogether 3 distinct photoactivation processes.

In all these process, TX showed a larger photosensitization efficiency than BP.

40|$|CDOM {{biogeochemical}} cycle {{is driven by}} several physical and biological processes such as river input, biogeneration and photobleaching that act as primary sinks and sources of CDOM. Watershed-derived allochthonous (WDA) and phytoplankton-derived autochthonous (PDA) CDOM were exposed to 9 days of natural solar radiation to assess the photobleaching response of different CDOM sources, using absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix) spectroscopy. Our results showed a marked decrease in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration under natural sunlight exposure for both WDA and PDA CDOM, indicating photoproduction of ammonium from TDN. In contrast, photobleaching caused a marked increase in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration for both WDA and PDA CDOM. Thus TDN:TDP ratios decreased significantly both for WDA and PDA CDOM, which partially explained the seasonal dynamic of TDN:TDP ratio in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching rate of CDOM absorption a(254), was 0. 032 m/MJ for WDA CDOM and 0. 051 m/MJ for PDA CDOM from days 0 - 9, indicating that <b>phototransformations</b> were initially more rapid for the newly produced CDOM from phytoplankton than for the river CDOM. Extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that 3. 9 %- 5. 1 % CDOM at the water surface was photobleached and mineralized every day in summer in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching caused the increase of spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and molecular size, indicating the CDOM mean molecular weight decrease which was favorable to further microbial degradation of mineralization. Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis models calculated separately for WDA and PDA CDOM.

The ratio of the quantum yields for Pr to Pfr <b>phototransformation</b> and for Pfr to Pr <b>phototransformation</b> (φr/φfr) is 1. 76 for the 124 kD molecule and 0. 98 for the 118 / 114 kD species.

Comparison of these quantum yields with those of the 118 / 114 kD species (where φr = φfr = ∼ 0. 11) indicates that proteolytic degradation of the 124 kD molecule to the 118 / 114 kD species significantly affects only φr.

Excitation at 808. 4 nm (into the low-energy side of B 800 R) shows that the lower limit of B 800 R → B 850 EET is about 2 ps, as the B 800 R → B 800 B <b>phototransformation</b> process could contribute to the corresponding zero-phonon hole width. The <b>phototransformation</b> of B 800 R leads to a ∼ 200 cm– 1 average blue-shift of transition energies, i. e., B 800 R changes into B 800 B. We argue that it is unlikely that B 800 -B 850 excitonic interactions give rise to a splitting of the B 800 band. We propose that the latter is caused by different protein conformations that can lead to both strong or weak hydrogen bond(s) between B 800 pigments and the protein scaffolding. Temperature-dependent absorption spectra of B 800, which revealed a well-defined isosbestic point, support a two-site model, likely with strongly and weakly hydrogen-bonded B 800 BChls. Thus, BChls contributing to B 800 R and B 800 B could differ in the position of the proton in the BChl carbonyl-protein hydrogen bond, i. e., proton dynamics along the hydrogen bond may well be the major mechanism of this <b>phototransformation.</b> However, the effective tunneling mass is likely larger than the proton mass...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} two novel methodologies for the photo-induced {{electron}} transfer (PET) cyclizations of polyalkene terpenoids, involving Cu 2 +-ions, are accomplished. The first methodology allows to generate in a stepwise fashion two cationic intermediates from an w-double bond of terpenoid polyalkene. The mechanism of this reaction is elucidated in this thesis.

The second new methodology is the result of further improvement of Cu(II) -mediated PET-cyclizations where Cu(II) -acetate is employed as a co-oxidant together with another Cu 2 +-ion involved in the complex. Different chiral and achiral Cu(II) -complexes are employed as substrates in the <b>phototransformations.</b> The aim of this part of work was to develop a catalytic and enantioselective photochemical cyclization with further application in natural products synthesis. Based on the products and some mechanistic investigations we propose a reaction mechanism for this complex cyclization cascade. Further, substitution of one of the substrates in the complex with a chiral semicorrin ligand gives an enantiomeric excess which is low, but might be possible to be improved in the future. To clear the relatively low enantioselectivity of this reaction additional quantum mechanical calculations of the structures of the Cu(II) - and analogous Zn(II) -complexes were performed. Another aim of the work was to analyze and possibly improve previously developed synthetic strategies toward the basic taxane skeleton and design the synthetic procedure to cyclize the precursor molecules to taxadiene bearing substituents or analogs thereof such as verticillene or cembrene.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in 1962, many developments allowed improving the use of this naturally light-emitting protein as a powerful tool for tracking proteins or organelles of interest within living cells and organisms. At the beginning of the 21 st century, {{the discovery}} of photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PAFPs), notably from Anthozoan species, triggered a revolution in the field of FP technology. Some PAFPs are capable of being irreversibly photoconverted from a green- to a red-emitting form while other ones can be reversibly switched on and off, depending on specific excitation wavelengths. These proteins are being extensively used in optical microscopy techniques, particularly in “nanoscopy”, which provides optical resolution 10 fold beyond the theoretical Abbe limit. In order to further develop these techniques, notably in term of time-resolution, the need to obtain brighter fluorescent probes that photoconvert or photoswitch efficiently is crucial. At the same time, fluorescent highlighters generally need to be monomeric and photostable. In order to better understand the mechanisms of <b>phototransformations</b> in PAFPs, three members of the family have been studied: EosFP, Dendra 2 and IrisFP. The phenomena of green-to-red photoconversion, reversible photoswitching and non-reversible photobleaching have been studied by a combination of X-ray crystallography and microspectrophotometry using the Cryobench laboratory of the ESRF/IBS. Together, the results have allowed us to propose a mechanism for the photoconversion of EosFP and Dendra 2 and to discover and characterize IrisFP, the first PAFP combining both properties of photoconversion and photoswitching. The structural modifications of the chromophore associated with an X-ray induced radical state, likely {{to be involved in the}} photobleaching pathway of PAFPs, were also characterized. I.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} here that {{carbamazepine}} (CBZ) would undergo direct photolysis and reaction with *OH {{as the main}} <b>phototransformation</b> pathways in surface waters. Environmental lifetimes are expected to vary from {{a few weeks to}} several months, and predictions are in good agreement with available field data. Acridine (I) and 10, 11 - dihydro- 10, 11 -trans-dihydroxy-CBZ (V) are the main quantified <b>phototransformation</b> intermediates upon direct photolysis and *OH reaction, respectively. The photochemical yield of mutagenic I from CBZ is in the 3 − 3. 5 % range, and it is similar for both direct photolysis and *OH reaction: it would undergo limited variation with environmental conditions. In contrast, the yield of V would vary in the 4 − 8. 5 % range depending on the conditions, because V is formed from CBZ by *OH (9. 0 % yield) more effectively than upon direct photolysis (1. 4 % yield). Other important photointermediates, mostly formed from CBZ upon *OH reaction, are an aromatic-ringdihydroxylated CBZ (VI) and N,N-bis(2 -carboxyphenyl) urea (VII). Compounds VI and VII are formed by photochemistry and are not reported as human metabolites; thus, they could be used as tracers of CBZ <b>phototransformation</b> in surface waters. Interestingly, VI has recently been detected in river water...|$|E

40|$|Structural changes {{involved}} in the Pr → Pfr photoconversion of phytochrome were studied using surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS). SERRS spectra of native 124 kDa phytochrome, chymotrypsin digested phytochrome and C-phycocyanin chromopeptides were measured. The SERRS studies indicate a Z → E isomerization occurs at the C 15 -C 16 double bond during the Pr to Pfr photoconversion of phytochrome in the native protein. SERRS studies using deuterated sols indicate that the phytochrome chromophore is protonated in the Pr form, perhaps in the Pfr form. SERRS studies of the first photointermediate of the Pr → Pfr <b>phototransformation</b> tentatively suggest that the formation of Lumi-R involves an out of plane bending of ring-D along with a deprotonation and/or a breaking of hydrogen bonds to the chromophore. ^ The reorientation of the phytochrome upon Pr → Pfr <b>phototransformation</b> was studied by Forster energy transfer from N-terminal specific fluorescently labeled Fab antibody fragments. The Forster energy transfer measurements indicate a chromophore reorientation during the <b>phototransformation</b> {{and a decrease in}} the distance between the N-terminus and the phytochrome chromophore of 10 - 13 A. The use of fluorescently labeled Fab fragments for Forster energy-transfer studies is a novel method of measuring distances within proteins. The pulsed-diode laser based time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system developed to perform these studies represents a low-cost alternative to standard laser based TCSPC systems. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSingle-molecule {{localization}} microscopy {{of biological}} samples requires a precise {{knowledge of the}} employed fluorescent labels. Photoactivation, photoblinking and photobleaching of phototransformable fluorescent proteins influence the data acquisition and data processing strategies {{to be used in}} (Fluorescence) Photoactivation Localization Microscopy ((F) -PALM), notably for reliable molecular counting. As these parameters might depend on the local environment, they should be measured in cellulo in biologically relevant experimental conditions. Here, we measured <b>phototransformation</b> quantum yields for Dendra 2 fused to actin in fixed mammalian cells in typical (F) -PALM experiments. To this aim, we developed a data processing strategy based on the clustering optimization procedure proposed by Lee et al (PNAS 109, 17436 – 17441, 2012). Using simulations, we estimated the range of experimental parameters (molecular density, molecular orientation, background level, laser power, frametime) adequate for an accurate determination of the <b>phototransformation</b> yields. Under illumination at 561 nm in PBS buffer at pH 7. 4, the photobleaching yield of Dendra 2 fused to actin was measured to be (2. 560. 4) 610 25, whereas the blinking-off yield and thermally-activated blinking-on rate were measured to be (2. 360. 2) 610 25 and 11. 760. 5 s 21, respectively. These <b>phototransformation</b> yields differed from those measured in poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and were strongly affected by addition of the antifading agent 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane (DABCO). In the presence of DABCO, the photobleaching yield was reduced 2 -fold, the blinking-off yield was decreased more than 3 -fold, and the blinking-on rate was increased 2 -fold. Therefore, DABCO largely improved Dendra 2 photostability in fixed mammalian cells. These findings are consistent with redox-based bleaching and blinking mechanisms under (F) -PALM experimental conditions. Finally, the green-to-red photoconversion quantum yield of Dendra 2 was estimated to be (1. 460. 6) 610 25 in cellulo under 405 nm illumination.

40|$|Dark-grown YG- 6 mutant {{cells of}} Chlorella regularis {{accumulate}} {{at least two}} forms of phototransformable protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) with in vivo absorption maxima at 634 nm (Pchlide 634) and 650 nm (Pchlide 650). Difference spectrophotometric analyses and the action spectra showed that Pchlide 634 is first transformed into the 648 nm form and then phototransformed into chlorophyllide (Chlide) 672 nm. Pchlide 650 is phototransformed into Chlide 685 which then shifts towards short wavelength-forming Chlide 667 in the subsequent dark stage (Shibata shift). Pchlide 650 is re-generated {{at the expense of}} photoinactive Pchlide 632. In washed cells after the <b>phototransformation,</b> the Shibata shift was accelerated. Freezing/thawing treatment in the dark caused conversion of phototransformable Pchlide 650 into photoinactive Pchlide 633, but <b>phototransformation</b> activity of Pchlide 634 still partly remained. These results suggest that in the final step of light-dependent chlorophyll formation in the YG- 6 mutant of C. regularis, two sequentially and functionally separate routes are present...|$|E
40|$|The present {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} transformation and mineralization of methadone (MET) in aqueous solutions (demineralized water (DW) and synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SWeff)) by natural solar irradiation and two solar photocatalytic processes: heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton. Direct solar irradiation resulted in almost complete transformation of MET in the investigated matrices after 20 h of normalized irradiation time. MET photocatalytic transformation required shorter illumination times in DW compared to SWeff. Only 16 and 36 min of solar illumination were required during photo-Fenton and photocatalysis with TiO 2, respectively, to transform MET completely in SWeff. Mineralization of the {{dissolved organic carbon}} took place only during photocatalytic treatments. Kinetics parameters were calculated for processes comparison. Additionally, <b>phototransformation</b> intermediates generated during each treatment were investigated and characterized by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqTOF-MS/MS). The main MET <b>phototransformation</b> pathways were observed to be hydroxylation, and fragmentation and cyclization. According to the Vibrio fischeri bioassay, the acute toxicity of the generated <b>phototransformation</b> products was not relevant, since the observed inhibition percentages of bacterial bioluminescence were always below 30 % after 30 min of sample contact. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
