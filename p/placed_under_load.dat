However, it is unreasonable to conclude the main load passes that area with stress concentration because the hole (which has no material) is not important for carrying the load. The stress concentration caused by the structural singularities like a hole or a notch makes the load transfer analysis more difficult.|$|E

However, the exact mechanism of Pickett effect is still mysterious although several dubious hypotheses were proposed.

It can be mistaken for lubricating oil in some cases, but it consists of the [...] "heavy ends" [...] of the diesel fuel which do not burn when combustion temperature is too low. The heavier, more oily components of diesel fuel contain more stored energy than a comparable quantity of, say, gasoline, but diesel requires an adequate loading of the engine in order to keep combustion temperature high enough to make use of it. Often, one can hear a slight miss in the engine due to fuel buildup. When the engine is first <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> a <b>load</b> after long periods of idling and wetstacking it may blow some black exhaust out as it burns that excess fuel off.

Crack initiation in the weld is affected by onionskin partial bonding defects, and the tool pitch directly influences these defects. For a constant rotational speed, softening of the weld nugget reduces as the feed rate or translational tool velocity is increased (Krishnan 2002). Hence, {{it is clear that the}} formation of an onionskin macrostructure is related to variation in the tool pitch along the weld joint. Consequently, the possibility exists for process optimization to modify the weld microstructure and improve material properties, including fracture resistance.|$|R

Validation of the results obtained for the soils at relatively low saturation has been conducted using the established Brazilian (indirect) test for measuring the tensile strength of brittle materials. A fair comparison has been found and the results highlight the limited applicability of the Brazilian method to soils at very low water contents at which the tensile failure criterion has been assumed using this methodology. Optical characterisation {{of the performance of}} both testing methods has also been conducted using Digital Image Correlation. The consistent, accurate measurement of directly induced tensile strains using the proposed new method has been confirmed, verifying its capability to apply a direct tensile stress in the absence of shearing, a problem commonly associated with other tensile testing methods. The developed technique has then been used to investigate the water content–tensile strength relationship for compacted, unsaturated soils and offers significant advantages in the characterisation of clay soils subjected to variable climatic loading...|$|R

In reality, displacements take <b>place</b> <b>under</b> wave <b>loading,</b> whether they are small and insignificant or large and representing serious structural damage. In this work, a code that combines finite- and discrete-element methods which can simulate motion and interaction among units was used to conduct a numerical investigation.

By analysing the displacements and assessing the number of units that were displaced by more than one-third their nominal size, the numerical test programme indicated clearly that the initial build packing density {{was the most important}} parameter influencing the stability of concrete armour layers under vibration. The size of the underlayer rock and the type of unit also affected the numerical performance of the single-layer concrete armour systems under vibration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurements of the {{mechanical}} and electrical properties of Nafion and Nafion/titania composite membranes in constrained environments are reported. The elas-tic and plastic deformation of Nafion-based materials decreases with both the tempera-ture and water content. Nafion/titania composites have slightly higher elastic moduli. The composite membranes exhibit less strain hardening than Nafion. Composite mem-branes also show {{a reduction in the}} long-time creep of 40 % in comparison with Nafion. Water uptake is faster in Nafion membranes recast from solution in comparison with extruded Nafion. The addition of 3 – 20 wt % titania particles has minimal effect on the rate of water uptake. Water sorption by Nafion membranes generates a swelling pressure of 0. 55 MPa in 125 -lm membranes. The resistivity of Nafion increases when the mem-brane is <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> a <b>load.</b> At 23 8 C and 100 % relative humidity, the resistivity of Nafion increases by 15 % under an applied stress of 7. 5 MPa. There is a substantial hy-steresis in the membrane resistivity {{as a function of the}} applied stress depending on whether the pressure is increasing or decreasing. The results demonstrate how the dynamics of water uptake and loss from membranes are dependent on physical con-straints, and these constraints can impact fuel cell performance.

The current investigation seeks to better understand the types of events that evoke a teleological perspective and the conditions and individual difference factors that facilitate it. The results revealed that participants high in religiosity and low in ACT science reasoning are more likely to commit teleological errors (i. e., imbuing purpose upon events with non-intentional causal forces). Additionally, participants of low religiosity were more likely to commit teleological errors when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> cognitive <b>load.</b> It appears that two routes to teleological reasoning exist: one that represents an explicit belief system such as religion, and one that reflects implicit intuitions about how the world works.

The macro/microstructure and mechanical properties of both as-welded and heat-treated specimens are investigated by radiography, SEM, and tensile tests. Moreover, high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction is performed to measure the residual stresses and evaluate the microstructure evolution. It is found that the residual stresses are distributed in a three-peak shape {{in the region of}} the weld zone and heat-affected zone of the as-welded specimen due to the microstructural transformation and heat softening. The residual stresses are largely relieved after the {{heat treatment}}. The heat-treated specimens have a near fully lamellar microstructure and show balanced mechanical properties of strength and ductility.

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the stability of the}} thumb carpometacarpal joint following either complete removal of the trapezium(TR) or partial removal of the trapezium and of the base of the first metacarpal (PTR). We utilized local capsular tissue for interposition graft in both cases. Methods: Right and left fresh frozen cadaveric hands from the same donor were randomized so that TR or PTR repair was performed randomly on the right or left hand of each pair. In the TR group we removed the entire trapezium. In the PTR group we removed 2 mm of distal trapezium and 2 mm of thumb metacarpal base. For both repairs, we interposed a capsular tissue graft. The cadaveric hands were stabilized in a jig designed to apply load across six thumb tendons. We measured gap closure distances prior to and following surgery and examined the joints by radiograph. Distances were measured using the Hough Transform model for measurement of abstract shapes. In order to detect a difference in gap distances between groups of 2 mm with an alpha error of 0. 05 and a beta error of 0. 20, 18 hands were required. Results: The designated surgery was successfully performed on all hands. At baseline, mean gap differences did not vary between groups <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> while after surgery the TR group had greater mean gap closure when compared to the PTR group (4. 44 mm± 1. 70 vs 2. 42 mm± 1. 92, P<. 001). No bone on bone contact was noted in any of the operated joints. Discussion: We found that PTR of the thumb basal joint leads to less gap closure of the joint when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> simulated physiological <b>load</b> when compared to the complete removal of the trapezium.

There are obvious challenges associated with the sourcing of human tendon samples for in vitro analysis so animal models are regularly adopted. However, data indicates that fatigue life varies significantly between tendons of different species and with different stresses in life. Positional tendons such as rat tail tendon or the bovine digital extensor are commonly applied in in vitro studies of tendon overuse, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest their behaviour is indicative of the types of human tendon particularly prone to overuse injuries. In this study, the fatigue response of the largely positional digital extensor and the more energy storing deep digital flexor tendon of the bovine hoof were compared to the semitendinosus tendon of the human hamstring. Fascicles from each tendon type were subjected to either stress or strain controlled fatigue loading (cyclic creep or cyclic stress relaxation respectively). Gross fascicle mechanics were monitored after cyclic stress relaxation and the mean number of cycles to failure investigated with creep loading. Bovine extensor fascicles demonstrated the poorest fatigue response, while the energy storing human semitendinosus was the most fatigue resistant. Despite the superior fatigue response of the energy storing tendons, confocal imaging suggested a similar degree of damage in all three tendon types; it appears the more energy storing tendons are better able to withstand damage without detriment to mechanics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{spite of}} {{improvements}} in composite function, marginal microleakage in deep composite restoration {{is still considered}} as a challenge due to unstable bond between composite and dentin. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate effect of applying different materials on marginal microleakage in posterior composite restoration. Methods: A standard distal box was prepared on 80 human premolar. The gingival floors were 1 millimeter under CEJ. The specimens were divided to four groups. In the first group, 1 millimeter amalgam {{was used as the}} first increment in proximal box on gingival floor, in the second group flow able composite, and in the third group, RMGI were used. Other cavities were filled by condensable composite. In the fourth group (control), all the cavities were filled only by condensable composite. The specimens, after 6 months of storage, were <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> cyclic <b>load</b> (10000 cycle- 80 N- 1 Hz), and then were immersed in 2 % methylene blue for 6 hours. Afterwards, the specimens were sectioned in the middle of restoration. Extension of dye penetration at the cervical margin was examined under a stereo microscope at 25 x magnification and the leakage was evaluated by Fuks degree. The study data were statistically analyzed using the Mann- Whitney U-test (p< 0. 05). Results: Microleakage was observed in all the groups. The third group demonstrated the most leakage and the least was for the first group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups.) p-value = 0. 689) Conclusion: In cavities with gingival floor under CEJ, different filling methods have no effect on marginal sealing...|$|R
5000|$|Shafts are {{quantified}} in {{a number}} of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> a <b>load.</b> A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, which requires more power to flex and [...] "whip" [...] through the ball properly (which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance), while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings, but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square at impact, resulting in lower accuracy. Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L/W (Lady/Women's), A/I (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (80 - 94 mph), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower swing speed (70 - 79 mph), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above 100 mi/h km/h. Some companies also offer a [...] "stiff-regular" [...] or [...] "firm" [...] flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a Regular shaft (90 - 100 mph), allowing golfers and club makers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player.|$|R
