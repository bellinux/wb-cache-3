The lake acts as a reservoir with a surface area of 850 acres. It can store 78,000 acre-feet of water at a lake surface elevation of 1383 feet. The <b>power</b> <b>tunnel</b> is 10 feet in diameter and extends 26,300 feet from the dam to the penstock, from an inlet 143 feet below the nominal surface of the lake. The penstock that connects the <b>power</b> <b>tunnel</b> to the powerhouse is steel-lined and runs for 3,400 feet, varying from 56 to 96 inches in diameter. The station discharges water to the Kizhuyak River. Other civil works for the project include several dikes, smaller dams and diversion channels to collect water into the lake. A 17-mile private road was built between the barge landing site at the head of Kizhuyak Bay to the powerhouse. Major equipment and materials arrive by landing craft at the beach, and then are hauled up the private road. A 17-mile transmission line energized at 138 kV connects the switchyard near the powerhouse to the substation at the City of Kodiak.

5000|$|In August 2009 {{the station}} was shut down and the <b>power</b> <b>tunnel</b> drained because of {{internal}} rock falls near {{the head of the}} tunnel. Although the equipment in the power station was not affected, Glendoe was unable to generate power until repairs were made. SSE reported that electricity generation was unlikely to proceed until well into 2012. The repairs involved construction of a bypass tunnel and a downstream access tunnel. [...] The contract for the repair work was awarded to BAM Nuttall. SSE issued proceedings seeking to recover £130 million in repair and reinstatement costs and £65 million in alleged loss of profit from Hochtief, who constructed the original tunnel, but in a Judgment (Opinion) published in December 2016 Hochtief was held by the Scottish Court of Session not to have been liable for the collapse.|$|E
50|$|The dam serves {{mainly for}} the {{generation}} of hydroelectric power. It {{is an important component}} of Southern California Edison's Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, which comprises a system of 25 dams, nine power plants and supporting tunnels and diversion channels in the upper basin of the San Joaquin River. Water from the reservoir is diverted into a 7.45 mi-long reinforced concrete penstock into Mammoth Pool Powerhouse, which has two 100,000 hp turbines totaling a nominal generating capacity of 190 megawatts (MW). Due to friction decreasing flow rate in the <b>power</b> <b>tunnel,</b> the actual output during maximum generation is only about 187 MW. A 350 ft high surge chamber is located shortly above the powerhouse to provide protection to the turbines in case of abrupt flow fluctuations through the tunnel.
