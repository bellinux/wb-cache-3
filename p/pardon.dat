5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his <b>pardon</b> of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a <b>pardon</b> indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a <b>pardon</b> was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his <b>pardon</b> of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the <b>pardon,</b> but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

50|$|While most presidents grant <b>pardons</b> {{throughout}} their terms, Clinton chose to make {{nearly a third}} of them on January 20, 2001, his last day in office. This {{came to be known as}} Pardongate While Clinton <b>pardoned</b> a large number (450) of people compared with his immediate predecessor Republican George H. W. Bush, who <b>pardoned</b> only 75, the number of people <b>pardoned</b> by Clinton was comparable to that <b>pardoned</b> by Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Jimmy Carter, who <b>pardoned</b> 406 and 566 respectively.|$|R
50|$|With the {{stipulation}} {{that the}} warden will choose randomly, in the 1/3 {{of the time}} that A is to be <b>pardoned,</b> there is a 1/2 chance he will say B and 1/2 chance he will say C. This means that taken overall, 1/6 of the time (1/3 A is <b>pardoned</b> * 1/2 warden says B), the warden will say B because A will be <b>pardoned,</b> and 1/6 of the time (1/3 A is <b>pardoned</b> * 1/2 warden says C) he will say C because A is being <b>pardoned.</b> This adds up to the total of 1/3 of the time (1/6 + 1/6) A is being <b>pardoned,</b> which is accurate.|$|R
50|$|Treen {{challenged}} Edwards {{regarding the}} issuance of <b>pardons</b> and paroles. Whereas Treen had signed 34 <b>pardons</b> in {{three and a half}} years in the office, Edwards had approved 1,526 <b>pardons</b> or commutations of sentences in his first two terms. One of those <b>pardoned</b> in 1980 was a man who became a client of and murdered Edwards' brother, Nolan Edwards, an attorney in Crowley.|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} a third jury consumed {{a year and}} a half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe. Doctors used a silver tube to repair his windpipe, and Desha survived. On {{the last day of the}} court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet empaneled a jury. Governor Desha stood and produced a <b>pardon</b> for his son. Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the <b>pardon,</b> records show that he served out the rest of his term. The <b>pardon</b> damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|E
5|$|After {{his escape}} from Detroit, Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a <b>pardon</b> for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty oath to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him an exception to the <b>pardon,</b> he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E

50|$|The Associated Press, in {{conjunction}} with the Sioux Falls newspaper Argus Leader, filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain information on <b>pardons</b> granted by Janklow between 1995 and 2002. Reporters found that the <b>pardons</b> did not follow the statutory process, which requires <b>pardons</b> to be reviewed by an independent commission. Among Janklow's <b>pardons</b> was one for his son-in-law for convictions for drunk driving and marijuana possession.|$|R
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a <b>pardon,</b> {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general <b>pardon</b> for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the <b>pardon</b> being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E
5|$|French singer Mireille Mathieu, who {{frequently}} performed in Russia, {{was one of}} the few western entertainers to speak out against Pussy Riot, saying they had committed a sacrilege. Nevertheless, she asked for “indulgence” (lenience or <b>pardon)</b> for the three women.|$|E

50|$|The {{answer is}} that {{prisoner}} A didn't gain information about his own fate, since he already knew that the warden would give him the name of someone else. Prisoner A, prior to hearing from the warden, estimates his chances of being <b>pardoned</b> as 1/3, the same as both B and C. As the warden says B will be executed, it's either because C will be <b>pardoned</b> (1/3 chance), or A will be <b>pardoned</b> (1/3 chance) and the B/C coin the warden flipped came up B (1/2 chance; {{for a total of}} a 1/6 chance B was named because A will be <b>pardoned).</b> Hence, after hearing that B will be executed, the estimate of A's chance of being <b>pardoned</b> is half that of C. This means his chances of being <b>pardoned,</b> now knowing B isn't, again are 1/3, but C has a 2/3 chance of being <b>pardoned.</b>|$|R

5|$|Noreen's husband, Ashiq Masih, 51 {{years old}} at the time, {{announced}} that he planned to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen would most likely be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence. Zardari was poised to grant <b>pardon</b> but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential <b>pardon,</b> which remains in force till date. Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare not repeat Bibi's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy.|$|E

50|$|Mrs. Ferguson's infamously generous {{granting}} of <b>pardons</b> was {{her way of}} relieving the overcrowded conditions in Texas prisons. During two non-consecutive terms in office, Mrs. Ferguson issued almost 4,000 <b>pardons,</b> many of them to free those convicted of violating prohibition laws. Though never proven, rumors persisted that <b>pardons</b> were available in exchange for cash payments to the governor’s husband. In 1936, voters passed {{an amendment to the}} state constitution stripping the governor of the power to issue <b>pardons</b> and granting that power to a politically independent Texas Board of <b>Pardons</b> and Paroles (see Capital punishment in Texas).|$|R

I appreciate the <b>Pardons</b> and Parole Board for continuing our progress today and officially granting these <b>pardons.</b> Today, the Scottsboro Boys have finally received justice.|$|R
5|$|On September 16, {{shortly after}} he {{announced}} the Nixon <b>pardon,</b> Ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada, and for military deserters, in Presidential Proclamation 4313. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service {{for those who had}} served less than two years of honorable service in the military. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential <b>Pardon</b> and a change in Military discharge status. Full <b>pardon</b> for draft dodgers came in the Carter Administration.|$|E

5|$|The {{grand jury}} {{continued}} its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket <b>pardon.</b> Two were returned against members of Fletcher's staff, {{and two were}} against unpaid advisors to Fletcher. The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a whistleblower. Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the <b>pardon.</b> On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could {{be included in the}} jury's final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the <b>pardon.</b> Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the <b>pardon</b> and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the <b>pardon</b> had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a <b>pardon.</b> Clinton maintained that the <b>pardon</b> had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
