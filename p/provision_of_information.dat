5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Bound {{noted that}} {{participation}} in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members {{with the ability to}} better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment. [...] In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication. [...] There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat. [...] Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public. [...] In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.|$|E

[...] Others allege that as Lord chancellor, he had no say in military affairs and the Encyclopædia Britannica states that he was [...] "neither cruel nor immoderate and was inclined to mercy when dealing with individuals", however the same source also states that [...] "(Fitzgibbon).. was a powerful supporter of a repressive policy toward Irish Catholics". Fitzgibbon's former side was displayed by sparing the lives of the captured United Irish leaders, 'State prisoners', in return for their confession of complicity and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> relating to the planning of the rebellion. However, this willingness of the prisoners to partake of the agreement was spurred by the execution of the brothers John and Henry Sheares on 14 July 1798.|$|E

2500|$|Although Yen Bai was the exception, {{this did}} not mean that the SRM ran {{smoothly}} or that the performance standards could not be higher. A month after the mutiny, General Commandant Superior Aubert circulated SRM Notice 660, on March 11, 1930, to describe (and prescribe) the morale and techniques needed for an effective intelligence service. It stressed the importance of understanding the objectives and organisational structure of anti-colonial parties and then advised on {{the ways in which the}} revolutionary threat could be nullified. The note also deemed it necessary to remind its recipients about two earlier intelligence communications [...] of February 25 and October 17, 1929 [...] thus indicating that they had not been taken on board completely. One of the reasons given for this was what was seen as the complacent attitude of many officers, in assuming that they could [...] "preserve [...] units from revolutionary propaganda" [...] and related to this, the low morale of many European warrant officers who regarded [...] "their [...] role as ending when their working hours are over". Apart from indicating what officers should be giving their due diligence, Aubert's note also indicated the means by which critical intelligence information could be obtained. This largely depended on close collaboration with Vietnamese warrant officers who had an important intelligence role in their position as a conduit between their French masters and their Vietnamese troops. The flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. The French were often not tactful and discreet enough, and many were not, due to a lack of language skills or interest, [...] "in real contact with the indigenous warrant officers." [...] On the other hand, the Vietnamese were not very open with regard to the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> and thus did not take (co-)responsibility [...] "for the maintenance of the troops' good spirit". Despite the air of good appearance and behaviour of the Vietnamese warrant officers and tirailleurs, they often misled ltheir French superiors about their knowledge of subversive activities. This posed a major problem in intelligence gathering, necessitating the cross-checking of information, as well as threatening harsh penalties if information was withheld.|$|E
