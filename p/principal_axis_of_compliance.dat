The galaxies in and around the Virgo cluster from the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog recently constructed by Kim et al. are used to determine the direction of the local sheet. The peculiar velocity field reconstructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 is analyzed to estimate the local velocity shear tensor at the Virgo center. Showing first that the minor <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the local velocity shear tensor is almost parallel to the line of sight direction, we detect a clear signal of alignment between the positions of the Virgo satellites and the intermediate <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the local velocity shear projected onto the plane of the sky. Furthermore, the dwarf satellites are found to appear more strongly aligned than the normal counterparts, which is interpreted as indication of the following: (i) The normal and the dwarf satellites fall in the Virgo cluster preferentially along the local filament and the local sheet, respectively. (ii) The local filament is aligned with the minor <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the local velocity shear while the local sheet is in parallel to the plane spanned by the minor and the intermediate principal axes.

Since ultrasound {{shear wave elastography}} measures shear modulus along the <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the probe (i. e., along the transverse <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the im-aging plane), the measured shear modulus most accurately represents the mechanical property of the muscle along the fascicle direction when the probe’s <b>principal</b> <b>axis</b> {{is parallel to the}} fascicle direction in the plane of the ultrasound image. However, it is unclear how the measured shear modulus is affected by the probe angle relative to the fascicle direction in the same plane.
