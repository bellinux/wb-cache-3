50|$|A voice {{prosthesis}} (plural prostheses) is {{an artificial}} device, usually made of silicone {{that is used}} to help laryngectomized patients to speak. During a total laryngectomy, the entire voice box (larynx) is removed and the windpipe (trachea) and food pipe (esophagus) are separated from each other. During this operation an opening between the food pipe and the windpipe can be created (primary puncture). This opening can also be created at a later time (secondary puncture). This opening is called a tracheo-esophageal <b>puncture</b> (<b>TE</b> puncture). The voice prosthesis is placed in this opening. Then, it becomes possible to speak by occluding the stoma and blowing the air from the lungs through the inside of the voice prosthesis and through the throat, creating a voice sound, which is called tracheo-esophageal speech.The back end of the prosthesis sits at the food pipe. To avoid food, drinks, or saliva from coming through the prosthesis and into the lungs, the prosthesis has a small flap at the back.There are two ways of inserting the voice prosthesis: through the mouth and throat (retrograde manner) {{with the help of a}} guide wire, or directly through the tracheostoma (anterograde) manner. Nowadays, most voice prosthesis are placed anterograde, through the stoma.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Secondary tracheoesophageal (<b>TE)</b> <b>puncture</b> standardly {{involves}} {{placement of}} a catheter {{at time of}} TE fistula creation. We explore the feasibility of placement of the prosthesis {{at the time of}} <b>TE</b> <b>puncture</b> (TEP) obviating the need for a subsequent procedure to place the prosthesis. We describe the technique and evaluate the success and potential advantages. Study Design: Retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who underwent TE prosthesis placement at the time of secondary TEP from 3 / 2009 to 1 / 2011. Methods: Fourteen patients underwent the primary TE prosthesis placement at the time of secondary puncture and were evaluated. Assessed outcomes included patient demographics, success of prosthesis placement, need for repeat proce-dure, early or late prosthesis dislodgement, complications, and specific voice outcomes. Results: Patient cohort included nine males, five females, with average age of 64 years. All TE prosthesis placements were successful. The 12 -mm 20 F Blom-Singer Indwelling prosthesis was used in all cases. No complications occurred during prosthesis placement. Two perioperative complications occurred: one case of transient pulmonary edema from general anes-thesia, one case of posterior tracheal wall swelling. The second was addressed with placement of a larger prosthesis. All patients successfully achieved good voice at an average of 4 days after the procedure (range: 1 â€“ 9 days). Conclusions: This initial series of 14 consecutive patients demonstrates successful TE prosthesis placement at the time of secondary <b>TE</b> <b>puncture.</b> Functional voice was achieved in all patients with no significant immediate complications.

40|$|Conclusions: Provox Vega {{prostheses}} demonstrate good short-term feasibility, {{and their}} optimized airflow-resistance design offers laryngectomy patients indwelling voice prostheses with more choices in outer diameters without sacrificing (too) much in voice quality. Objectives: Technological progress enables improvement of in vitro airflow characteristics of voice prostheses {{and design of}} voice prostheses with smaller outer diameters. This could potentially improve voice quality in users of Provox 2, and avoid diminished voice quality in users of prostheses with smaller outer diameters. Methods: This was a prospective clinical phase I/feasibility study of three newly designed indwelling voice prostheses (Provox Vega 22. 5 (Provox 2 successor), 20, and 17 Fr). Assessments consisted of patients' self-reported voice and speech, perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis, maximum phonation time, loudness, speech rate, pull-out force and adaptation of the tracheoesophageal (<b>TE)</b> <b>puncture</b> to smaller diameter voice prostheses. Vega 22. 5 was assessed in 15 patients (all Provox ActiValve users, observation period 3 weeks), and 16 patients with Vega 20 / 17 (2 weeks each). Results: No voice prostheses problems were encountered. Half of the patients with Vega 22. 5 preferred that for its better voice quality. Voice and speech were considered equal to Provox 2 for Vega 20, but slightly less for Vega 17. Most <b>TE</b> <b>punctures</b> adapted well to the smaller diameter voice prostheses. <...|$|R
50|$|The {{size of a}} voice {{prosthesis}} {{varies in}} length, depending on {{the thickness of the}} wall between the foodpipe and the windpipe and thereby the length of the <b>TE</b> <b>puncture.</b> The according length of the voice prosthesis ranges usually between 4 and 22 mm. Another parameter is the outer diameter of the shaft of the voice prosthesis, ranging from 16-22.5 French. Which outer diameter is used is decided by the clinician and/or the patient and is most often a matter of personal preference. Studies have shown that a larger outer diameter of the voice prosthesis allows better airflow and thereby requires less effort to speak which has a positive effect on the overall voice quality.|$|R
40|$|For {{patients}} with advanced laryngeal cancer {{it is sometimes}} necessary to surgically remove the complete larynx. The most disturbing consequence for these patients {{is the loss of}} the natural way to speak. To speak again a shunt valve is put in the surgically created trachea-esophageal (<b>TE)</b> <b>puncture.</b> This way airflow from the the trachea can flow to the esophagus and initiate a vibration. A primary disadvantage of TE speech is the unnaturally low fundamental frequency. To improve the speech a voice producing element (VPE) can be incorporated in the shunt valve. This VPE consists out of two membranes stretched within a cylindrical channel. The membrane-based VPE is two-dimensionally modelled in COMSOL Multiphysics. The models for this VPE and results will be presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Indications include voice {{rehabilitation}} {{for patients who}} are undergoing a total laryngectomy (primary puncture) or patients {{who have had a}} total laryngectomy in the past (secondary puncture).Contra-indications are mainly related {{to the use of the}} voice prosthesis and not the puncture procedure itself. It is important to have healthy tissue at the puncture site. This will help ensure the voice prosthesis is properly supported. Poor tissue condition at the puncture site can be a contra-indication for <b>TE</b> <b>puncture.</b> It is also important that the patient candidacy be taken into account. Patients must be able to understand and manage proper prosthesis maintenance and monitor for complications or device problems. Bleeding disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, poor vision and poor manual dexterity are all factors that may negatively interfere with successful voice restoration using tracheoesophageal techniques and should be discussed further with an appropriate healthcare provider who is knowledgeable in this topic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After total laryngectomy, the {{placement}} of a tracheoesophageal (<b>TE)</b> <b>puncture</b> offers the possibility to gain a new voice. However, the produced TE speech {{is known to have}} a lower quality and intelligibility. The goal {{of this paper is to}} identify and quantify the acoustic artefacts in TE speech. The advantage of this study is two-fold. First, the proposed measures can be used by speech therapists in voice rehabilitation sessions to assess the voice of the patient, to follow up his/her evolution and to design tailored exercises. Secondly, these artefacts have to be quantified and taken into account in synthesis methods aiming at enhancing TE speech. Four categories of acoustic artefacts are identified in this work: a lower periodicity and regularity of the phonation, and the presence of high-frequency and gargling noises. Each artefact is studied and compared to normal laryngeal speech recorded either for speech synthesis purpose or by elderly people. Results quantify the importance of each of these artefacts, and show a large disparity between TE patients. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} objective measures {{and the results of}} subjective assessment of voice quality and speech intelligibility in patients submitted to total laryngectomy and tracheoesophageal (<b>TE)</b> <b>puncture.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. MATERIALS: Twenty patients implanted with voice prosthesis were studied. After surgery, the entire sample performed speech rehabilitation. The assessment protocol included maximum phonation time (MPT), number of syllables per deep breath, acoustic analysis of the sustained vowel /a/ and of a bisyllabic word, perceptual evaluation (pleasantness and intelligibility%), and self-assessment. RESULTS: The correlation between pleasantness and intelligibility% was statistically significant. Both the latter were significantly correlated with the acoustic signal type, the number of formant peaks, and the F(2) -F(1) difference. The intelligibility% and number of formant peaks were significantly correlated with the MPT and number of syllables per deep breath. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the number of formant peaks and both intelligibility% and pleasantness. The higher the number of syllables per deep breath and the longer the MPT, significantly higher was the number of formant peaks and the intelligibility%. The study failed to show significant correlation between patient's self-assessment of voice quality and both pleasantness and communication effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The multidimensional assessment seems to be a reliable tool to evaluate the TE functional outcome. Particularly, the results showed that both pleasantness and intelligibility of TE speech are correlated to the availability of expired air and the function of the vocal tract...|$|R
40|$|With our "Speaking Out " {{topic of}} stoma covers, I was {{surprised}} to see so many writing in who use the Old Fashioned Way. I thought most would be using the HME, since so many are started out with that now. I am a believer in everyone learning other methods of speech, basic ways of cleaning the stoma and using simple methods to clean a TEP and then moving on to new and better products when they are ready. If I had been able to learn esophageal speech, I would probably have been a big advocate. I did learn to use an If I had been able to learn esophageal speech, I would probably have been a big advocate. I did learn to use an electrolarynx and it was my only voice {{for a year and a}} half. I am forever grateful that I did. I have had few emergencies when I needed it but have known other larys, having a mild temporary problem or severely ill or dying, when that was the only voice left. It takes almost no strain to use, especially with an oral adaptor. Talking can take a lot of effort when you are not well. Other times, the TEP should have an air flow that is comfortable. I've stayed with the basic self-changable prosthesis ever since I had my <b>TE</b> <b>Puncture.</b> Some of the new ones have sounded effective but the people who have them inserted are often left with no training for taking care of them and, not being used to handling them, they are at a loss if they can't get to the nearest SLP who knows what to do. This is one reason I so fully support the Voice Institute so larys can learn more than they ever learn in the SLP's office. The time at the VI classroom is spent to teach the whys and wherefores...|$|R
