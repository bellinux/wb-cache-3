These subroutines were implemented into MCNP 4 A. Some small program changes were necessary for processing the input to read the <b>photoneutron</b> production cross sections and to install a <b>photoneutron</b> switch. Some arrays were installed or extended to sample <b>photoneutron</b> creation and loss information, and output routines were changed to give the appropriate summary tables. To verify and validate the <b>photoneutron</b> production data and the MCNP 4 A implementations, the yields of <b>photoneutron</b> sources were calculated and compared with experiments.
