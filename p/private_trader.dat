60|$|The false {{principles}} of this unmercantile transaction (to {{speak of it}} in the mildest terms) were too gross not to be visible to those who contrived it. That the Company should be made to borrow such a sum as two hundred thousand pounds[7] at eight per cent, (or terms deemed by the Company to be worse,) in order first to buy a commodity represented by themselves as depreciated in its ordinary market, in order afterwards to carry one half of it through a circuitous trading voyage, depending for its ultimate success on the prudent and fortunate management of two or three sales, and purchases and re-sales of goods, and the chance of two or three markets, with all the risks of sea and enemy, was plainly no undertaking for such a body. The activity, private interest, and the sharp eye of personal superintendency may now and then succeed in such projects; but the remote inspection and unwieldy movements of great public bodies can find nothing but loss in them. Their gains, comparatively small, ought to be upon sure grounds; but here (as the Council states the matter) the <b>private</b> <b>trader</b> actually declines to deal, which is a proof more than necessary to demonstrate the extreme imprudence of such an undertaking on the Company's account. Still stronger and equally obvious objections lay to that member of the project which regards the introduction of a contraband commodity into China, sent at such a risk of seizure not only of the immediate object to be smuggled in, but of all the Company's property in Canton, and possibly at a hazard to the existence of the British factory at that port.|$|E
40|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of agricultural}} markets in Kenya has highlighted the potential role of <b>private</b> <b>traders</b> in {{the marketing of}} agricultural commodities and the impact on rural incomes.

6000|$|The {{practical}} abrogation of Property and Marriage as {{they exist}} at present will occur without being much noticed. To {{the mass of}} men, the intelligent abolition of property would mean nothing except {{an increase in the}} quantity of food, clothing, housing, and comfort at their personal disposal, as well as a greater control over their time and circumstances. Very few persons now make any distinction between virtually complete property and property held on such highly developed public conditions as to place its income on the same footing as that of a propertyless clergyman, officer, or civil servant. A landed proprietor may still drive men and women off his land, demolish their dwellings, and replace them with sheep or deer; and in the unregulated trades the <b>private</b> <b>trader</b> may still spunge on the regulated trades and sacrifice the life and health of the nation as lawlessly as the Manchester cotton manufacturers did at the beginning of last century. But though the Factory Code on the one hand, and Trade Union organization on the other, have, within the lifetime of men still living, converted the old unrestricted property of the cotton manufacturer in his mill and the cotton spinner in his labor into a mere permission to trade or work on stringent public or collective conditions, imposed {{in the interest of the}} general welfare without any regard for individual hard cases, people in Lancashire still speak of their [...] "property" [...] in the old terms, meaning nothing more by it than the things a thief can be punished for stealing. The total abolition of property, and the conversion of every citizen into a salaried functionary in the public service, would leave much more than 99 per cent of the nation quite unconscious of any greater change than now takes place when the son of a shipowner goes into the navy. They would still call their watches and umbrellas and back gardens their property.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} this permit, {{for which he}} had paid a considerable sum, certain changes were made in the company by which the State secured a controlling influence in it. A new manager, Major Weyns, appeared, who represented the new régime, superseding M. Lévêque, who had sold the permits {{in the name of the}} original company. Major Weyns was zealous that the whole trade of the country should belong to the Concessionnaire Company, which was practically the Government, according to the usual, but internationally illegal, habit of the State. To secure this trade, the first step was evidently to destroy so well-known and successful a <b>private</b> <b>trader</b> as M. Rabinck. In spite of his permits, therefore, a charge was trumped up against him of having traded illegally in rubber--an offence which, even if he had no permit, was an impossibility in the face of that complete freedom of trade which was guaranteed by the Treaty of Berlin. The young Austrian could not bring himself to believe that the matter was serious. His letters are extant, showing that he regarded the matter as so preposterous that he could not feel any fears upon the subject. He was soon to be undeceived, and his eyes were opened too late to the character of the men and the organization with which he was dealing. Major Weyns sat in court-martial upon him. The offence with which he was charged, dealing illegally in rubber, was one which could only be punished by a maximum imprisonment of a month. This would not serve the purpose in view. Major Weyns within forty minutes tried the case, condemned the prisoner, and sentenced him to a year's imprisonment. There was an attempt to excuse this monstrous sentence afterward by the assertion that the crime punished was that of selling guns to the natives, but as a matter of fact there was at the time no mention of anything of the sort, as is proved by the existing minutes of the trial. Rabinck naturally appealed against such a sentence. He would have been wiser had he submitted to it in the nearest guard-house. In that case he might possibly have escaped with his life. In the other, he was doomed. [...] "He will go," [...] said Major Weyns, [...] "on such a nice little voyage that he will act like this no more, and others will take example from it." [...] The voyage in question was the two thousand miles which separated Katanga from the Appeal Court at Boma. He was to travel all this way under the sole escort of black soldiers, who had their own instructions. The unfortunate man felt that he could never reach his destination alive. [...] "Rumours have it," [...] he wrote to his relatives, [...] "that Europeans who have been taken are poisoned, so if I disappear without further news you may guess what has become of me." [...] Nothing more was heard from him save two agonized letters, begging officials to speed him on his way. He died, as he had foreseen, on the trip down the Congo, and was hurriedly buried in a wayside station when two hours more would have brought the body to Leopoldville. If it is possible to add a darker shadow to the black business it lies in the fact that the apologists of the State endeavoured to make the world believe that their victim's death was due to his own habit of taking morphia. The fact is denied by four creditable witnesses, who knew him well, but most of all is it denied by the activity and energy which had made him one of the leading traders of Central Africa--too good a trader to be allowed open competition with King Leopold's huge commercial monopoly. As a last and almost inconceivable touch, the whole of the dead man's caravans and outfits, amounting to some £15,000, were seized by those who had driven him to his death, and by the last reports neither his relatives nor his creditors have received any portion of this large sum. Consider the whole story and say if it is exaggeration to state that Gustav Maria Rabinck was robbed and murdered by the Congo Free State.|$|E

50|$|Pawnbroking in Germany is {{conducted}} at once by the state, by the municipalities, and by private enterprise; {{but of all}} these institutions the state loan office in Berlin is the most interesting. It dates from 1834, and the working capital was found, and still continues to be in part provided, by the Prussian State Bank. The profits are invested, and the interest devoted to charitable purposes. The maximum and minimum rates of interest are fixed, but the rate varies, and often stands at about 12%. Two-thirds of the estimated value is the usual extent of a loan; four-fifths is advanced on silver, and five-sixths on fine gold. State and municipal bonds may be pledged up {{to a maximum of}} L150, the advance being 80% of the value, and a fixed interest of 6% is charged upon these securities. The values are fixed by professional valuers, who are liable to make good any loss that may result from over-estimation. The bulk of the loans are under 5, and the state office is used less by the poor than by the middle classes. Loans run for six months, but a further six months' grace is allowed for redemption before the article pledged can be sold by auction. The net annual profit usually amounts to little more than I % upon the capital employed. Pawnbroking laws of Austria-Hungary {{are similar to those of}} England. Free trade exists, and the <b>private</b> <b>trader,</b> who does most of the business, must obtain a government concession and deposit caution-money from 80 to 800, according to the size of the town. He must, however, compete with the monts de pit or Versatzaemter, which are sometimes municipal and sometimes state institutions. The chief of these is the imperial pawn office of Vienna, which was founded with charitable objects by the emperor Joseph I in 1707, and one-half of the annual surplus has still to be paid over to the Vienna poor fund. Here, as in Berlin, the profits are relatively small. Interest is charged at the uniform rate of 10%, which is calculated in two-week periods, however speedily redemption may follow upon pawning. For small loans varying from two to three kronen, 5% only is charged. The Hungarian state and municipal institutions appear, on the whole, to compete somewhat more successfully with the private firms than is the case in Vienna.|$|E

40|$|When {{attempting}} to help farmers link to markets, development organizations emphasize {{the nature of}} the target organization (<b>private</b> <b>trader,</b> cooperative, non-government organization, processing plant, etc.) as a crucial element in developing a sustainable trading link. This paper argues that there is another facet to linking farmers to markets which is just as important in explaining the outcome of a trading relationship: {{the nature of the}} business-to-business relationship between stakeholders in the supply chain created. This paper synthesizes research findings on supply chain arrangements and mechanisms in business-to-business relationships encountered in supply chains distributing fresh vegetables to Ho Chi Minh City. Eleven months were spent in the field from July 2003 to May 2004 to conduct in-depth interviews with stakeholders in the chain. The links between important elements of good supply chain management practice and performance are illustrated by concrete examples from in-depth case studies. The positive impacts on performance of the following elements of business-to-business relationships are reviewed: commitment, coordination and joint planning, market orientation and information sharing, frequency of communication, and innovation. The results show that parallel vegetable supply chains differ in their structure and in the existence or lack of formal links (contracts) between business partners. However, the five elements of good supply chain management practice which are reviewed can be identified to varying degrees in all supply chains as strategies to achieve higher levels of performance. This research uncovers the existence of several hybrid forms of economic organization in the vegetable industry, thus highlighting the importance of characterizing the type of business-to-business relationship which evolves between supply chain stakeholders when {{attempting to}} link farmers to markets...|$|E

40|$|Keywords: Market liberalisation, rural households, traders, Kenya, market integration, cointegration analysis, difference-in-difference approach, farmer response. Most {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, liberalised their agricultural commodity {{markets in the}} 1980 s and 1990 s as a strategy to increase marketing efficiency. In this thesis, we provide {{an account of the}} impacts of market liberalisation on households in Northwestern Kenya, a maize surplus producing region. We apply several analytical frameworks including descriptive statistics, structure, conduct and performance modeling, cointegration and error correction modeling approaches, double differencing and multinomial probit regression to both primary and secondary data. A descriptive review of the market liberalisation process indicates that commodity markets are liberalised. This is particularly evidenced by the increased number of traders across the four commodity markets (fertiliser, seed, maize and milk) examined. However, the markets are only partially liberalised since there is still some government active participation in some markets like maize and milk.   An analysis of the structure, conduct and performance of the four commodity markets shows that the markets are competitive. This is evidenced by low trader concentration levels and marketing margins. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence of}} collusion among traders in terms of pricing or limiting market supply despite financial and structural constraints that limit firm expansion. The ensuing increased <b>private</b> <b>trader</b> participation in commodity markets partly explains the observed marketing integration among maize wholesale markets, and a positive and strong aggregate supply response both in the short- and long-run. By comparing farming activities of maize producing households in 1992 and 2003 by using panel data, we find that on-farm diversification and commercialisation have increased. In particular, fertiliser use increased dramatically in terms of number of households using fertiliser and the rate of use. Furthermore, the number of households participating in maize marketing increased from 40 percent in 1992 to 70 percent in 2003. Area under maize, distance to the market, rate of basal fertiliser use and household size are the major factors that influence household participation/non-participation in maize markets. Overall, the study shows that market liberalisation could be beneficial to households if constraints traders face could be eliminated and that the government has lost revenue because of its reduced role in commodity marketing activities...|$|E
40|$|Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) {{suggests}} that true Christian spirituality and virtue was threatened by eighteenth-century capitalism. In his novel, Defoe illustrates how religious piety was rendered {{difficult in the}} eighteenth century, {{an era in which}} many people participated in overseas trade because of the rise of proto-capitalism (Semmel 30). Crusoe has less difficulty being a devout Christian when living on the uninhabited island than he does before he is shipwrecked and after he goes back to society after twenty eight years of living in isolation. Crusoe’s lifestyle on the desolate island is in stark contrast to his lifestyle on the European mainland. On the latter, the European bourgeois capitalist culture motivates Crusoe to become wealthy and lures him into the trading business overseas. Yet on the desolate island, where Crusoe is the sole survivor of a shipwreck, he thanks God and repents the previous mistakes he has made. The absence of social and economic distractions gives him an opportunity to become more familiarized with Christianity. As Crusoe is isolated from society on the desolate island, he initially feels desperation and fear, which makes him turn to the Bible. It is because of what he reads in the Bible and his isolation from society that Crusoe reflects on his previous lifestyle and appreciates his new connection with God. However, {{by the end of the}} novel, the reader might wonder whether Crusoe has been able to keep the resolutions which he has made on the island. He is unable to maintain his religious piety when he leaves the island, as the capitalist society tempts him to become a <b>private</b> <b>trader</b> again. Indeed, by contrasting life on the mainland in a blooming market economy to life in isolation on an island, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe {{suggests that}} capitalism and a society obsessed with materialism made conversion to true Christianity difficult, or even impossible. As regards the influence and historical context of Robinson Crusoe, I will approach the novel from a New Historicist perspective and explain that it is a product of its time. Below, I will first show that the novel reflects contemporary ideas of true Christianity and conversion. After placing the novel in a historical context, I will contrast Crusoe’s lifestyle on the mainland amidst society with life in isolation on the island to analyze Crusoe’s religious experience and his psychological change to see how the capitalist society affects him and renders him unable to maintain religious piety. I will do this in three separate chapters. In this paper, I will limit my research to The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, as a focus on the whole Crusoe trilogy would be more appropriate in a master thesis...|$|E
40|$|Responsibility for the {{marketing}} and storage of maize is shifting from government-sponsored marketing boards {{to the private}} trading sector. This change has implications for producers, who may encounter new problems with the storage and marketing of the crop, and for traders. Assistance may be required during this transitional phase. Major changes are occurring to the way that maize is being marketed in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. After several decades of influence over maize pricing, procurement, storage and distribution by government-subsidized grain marketing organizations, encouragement is being given {{to the private sector}} to participate in the maize trade. The reasons for the change are not charitable. Governments are having {{to face up to the}} high costs of subsidizing the grain sector and running parastatal bodies. Many marketing cooperatives too have found their access to credit for the purchase of grain curtailed because they have been unable to meet repayments on earlier loans. Likewise governments have been unable or unwilling to continue to underwrite the cooperatives' debts. Under structural adjustment policies, governments have been encouraged to divest much direct responsibility for grain marketing and to create an enabling environment for the private sector. The degree to which the private sector has been able to participate has depended very much on the commitment made and the strength of the economy. For example, Ghana has always had a very strong private sector, Tanzania has moved fast and government intervention has declined rapidly. Zambia has faced difficulties during its rapid transition phase, whereas Zimbabwe has been pursuing a more cautious and structured approach. Difficult decisions have to be made over how to ensure fair producer and consumer prices whilst reducing the subsidy to {{the marketing}} board. Pressure on farm storage The immediate effect for many small-scale farmers, with perhaps less than ten or twenty bags of maize for sale, has been that the guaranteed market has gone. Whereas previously, soon after harvest they were able to sell surplus grain locally at a guaranteed price and be fairly sure of payment, they now find that none of these factors applies. Sale at harvest may attract low prices, but if they forego immediate sale, they have to make provision for holding the grain for longer, with added risk of spoilage and loss. Traditional storage methods, whilst adequate for the safe-keeping of local varieties of grain, are less well-suited for the higher-yielding varieties of some grains, particularly maize, which are very susceptible to insect damage in store. Some donors consider that the solution to rural storage problems lies in the provision of a communal or village storage building. The intention is that surplus grain shall be stored in a safe place and marketed from there, or be sold back to the villagers. Unfortunately, such systems rarely seem to run well in practice; there are too many practical and operational problems to be overcome. Indeed, adverse experiences in much of Africa point to the inadvisability of recommending this as an option. Development of grain trading Until liberalization policies were implemented, there was little or no opportunity for legalized trade in grains and, with pan-territorial and pan-seasonal prices, there was no real inducement for a <b>private</b> <b>trader.</b> Now, in the enabling environment, opportunities exist. However, many entrepreneurs face initial difficulties: finding the money to purchase grain, the means of transporting it and ways of establishing storage facilities. In the short-term, the pattem of business tends to be one of rapid turnover of stocks, preferably supplying identified markets so as to avoid all interest, storage and doublehandling costs. Grain trading therefore tends to focus solely around transporting from an accessible area of surplus production to an identified market. Hopefully this pattern will change as grain trading becomes more established and competitive. The long-term technical solutions are not difficult, but in the short-term there are problems to be overcome. For the producer, advice on how, when and where to sell might seem unnecessary, but it must be sought by those inexperienced and uncertain of the free market. Seemingly simple things, like obtaining a grain bag or arranging transport to a market, prove very difficult to resolve when cash is required in advance and the producer has none. For many farmers, sale may not be possible and may not even be sought immediately after harvest, and some provision of extra storage will be needed. The options are to extend and improve the capacity of traditional storage or to find temporary storage for bags of grain, often inside the house. Use of either method for more than a few months will require treatment of the grain with insecticide. For this, safe and effective pesticides must be available locally. Those farmers who live a long distance from markets are now at a disadvantage because high transport costs will erode their profits. One option for them is to replace maize as a cash crop with alternative crops of higher value and lower bulk such as oil seed and pulses. Extension support In the past, extension services have struggled to provide adequate support to farmers for post-harvest matters. Usually there are few storage experts and their research and extension support activities are underfunded. Post-harvest extension is now faced with a new challenge and demands for additional information. Producers would like to know where to deliver their grain to receive the best price and they need to know when is the best time to sell. Some wait at the farm hopefully for a buyer; others wait at the nearest roadside, sometimes for days on end. Ministries of agriculture must meet these new demands to support the dynamic process of liberalization. The challenge for extension workers is to serve farmers' interests with appropriate marketing and storage advice.
