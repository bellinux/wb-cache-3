40|$|Differences {{exist in}} {{electrocution}} rates of birds on wooden versus metal <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> However, mitigation measures effective on wooden <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> have not solved electrocution problems on metal poles. We examined {{the effectiveness of}} 12 experimental modifications of metal <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> to prevent electrocution of raptors. We did so by comparing raptors' perching behavior on paired modified and control poles. We tested 8 of these modifications in the field by comparing avian mortality before/after modification. Modifications were less effective when a 'perch guard' or 'perch' was used than when insulation was used. Small raptors (e. g., tawny owl [Strix aluco], Eurasian kestrel [Falco tinnunculus]) especially were not adequately protected by non-insulation methods. Differences in perching behavior and possibility of electrocution (i. e., wooden vs. steel power poleS) caused differences in effectiveness of modifications. We considered insulation of crossarm braces {{the most effective and}} practical modification to reduce electrocution of raptors by metal <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a <b>power</b> <b>pole.</b> Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the <b>power</b> <b>pole,</b> it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
25|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit was {{initiated}} in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 13 February 2009 by Slidders Lawyers against electricity distribution company SP AusNet, {{in relation to}} the Kilmore East fire that became part of the Kinglake complex, and the Beechworth fires. A partner at the firm indicated that the claim would centre on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. On 12 February police had taken away a section of power line as well as a <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line that fell on the morning of 7 February and was believed to have started the fire there.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on January21, a large tornado touched down {{northwest}} of Purvis in Lamar County, Mississippi, at 3:35a.m. EST (08:35UTC). The tornado initially caused EF1 damage, snapping and uprooting many trees and destroying small sheds. A house sustained minor roof damage and collapse of its carport, and a <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> was snapped as well. Further to the northeast, the tornado reached EF2 intensity as it ripped the roof off of a well-built brick home and destroyed outbuildings. As the tornado approached the Forrest County line, EF2 damage continued as another home had its roof torn off, a mobile home was completely destroyed, and a billboard pole was snapped. Other homes in this area sustained minor roof damage, and trees and power poles were downed. The tornado intensified to EF3 strength shortly after it crossed the Forrest County line and entered residential areas of southwestern Hattiesburg, where multiple well-constructed brick homes had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed, and an elderly woman was killed. The tornado continued producing EF3 damage as it crossed Veterans Memorial Drive, snapping metal power pylons and severely damaging two buildings at Living Word Church. Maintaining its strength, the tornado moved across U.S. Route 49 and through a residential area, damaging several homes and destroying the top floor of a church. The tornado then tore directly through the William Carey University campus, resulting in severe structural damage and tossing and damaging numerous vehicles in the parking lots. Multiple large, multi-story brick buildings had windows blown out, roofs ripped off, and top floor exterior walls collapsed. Light poles were downed at the ball field as well.|$|E

500|$|While driving home, Veronica discovers Aaron in {{the back}} seat of her car and crashes into a <b>power</b> <b>pole.</b> Although both are knocked unconscious, Veronica awakens first and {{distributes}} the tapes around a nearby house. Aaron traps Veronica in a fridge, and when Keith arrives, he lights it on fire. Keith is burnt freeing Veronica, and Aaron is hit by a truck while trying to escape. The police arrive and Keith and Aaron are taken away on stretchers as Aaron is read his rights. Jake vows to see Aaron fry for his actions and is also arrested. Keith wakes up in hospital to find Alicia by his side. Veronica arrives home and tells her mother to leave before Keith comes home; she knows that Lianne is still drinking and did not finish her rehab. Lianne packs her bags and steals the $50,000 settlement check from the Kanes before she leaves. Veronica dreams about her and Lilly floating on a pool raft in a pool full of flowers, and they say their final goodbyes. Veronica wakes up and answers the door, and tells the unseen person, [...] "I was hoping it would be you".|$|E
500|$|The storm's worst impacts were {{concentrated}} in the coastal Bangladeshi districts of Bagerhat, Barguna, Bhola, Jessore, Khulna, Patuakhali and Satkhira, {{as well as the}} Sundarbans. A 2m (6.6ft) storm surge inflicted significant damage along the Bangladeshi coast and forced the temporary closure of the Port of Mongla, where nine were killed. Off the coast, waves generated by the tropical cyclone reached 4.5m (15ft). Twenty vessels and barges and hundreds of small fishing boats sank {{as a result of the}} rough seas and storm surge generated by the storm. [...] Another 37vessels carrying ₤2million (US$3.7million) of goods ran aground. Approximately 200km (120mi) offshore, the Singaporean freighter Pumori capsized due to the cyclone, killing 19. Initially reported as a much lower figure, 5,708fatalities occurred as a result of the tropical cyclone. Despite the high death toll, the Bangladeshi government stated that human casualties were minimized by efficient early warning systems. However, other deaths were blamed on poor communication systems, which did not effectively relay information to residents in more rural areas. Many of the deaths were caused by the collapse of dwellings or by electrocution due to the collapse of high tension power poles, and most of the deaths occurred in Khulna District. Nine people were killed in Khulna after a single <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> collapsed onto a house. A hundred corpses were discovered on the island of Dublar Char alone. In Satkhira, 100people were killed due to flying debris kicked up by the storm's fierce winds. In addition to the fatalities, nearly three million people were left homeless.|$|E
40|$|Discussing urban {{planning}} requires rethinking sustainability {{in cities and}} building healthy environments. Historically, some aspects of advancing the urban way of life have not been considered important in city planning. This is particularly the case where technological advances have led to conflicting land use, as with the installation of <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and building electrical substations near residential areas. This research aims to discuss and rethink sustainability in cities, focusing on {{the environmental impact of}} low-frequency noise and electromagnetic radiation on human health. It presents data from a case study in an urban space in northern Portugal, and focuses on four guiding questions: Can <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause noise? Do <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause discomfort? Do <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause discomfort due to noise? Can <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines affect human health? To answer these questions, we undertook research between 2014 and 2015 that was comprised of two approaches. The first approach consisted of evaluating the noise of nine points divided into two groups “near the source” (e. g., up to 50 m from <b>power</b> <b>poles)</b> and “away from the source” (e. g., more than 250 m away from the source). In the second approach, noise levels were measured for 72 h in houses located up to 20 m from the source. The groups consist of residents living within the distance range specified for each group. The measurement values were compared with the proposed criteria for assessing low-frequency noise using the DEFRA Guidance (University of Salford). In the first approach, the noise caused discomfort, regardless of the group. In the second approach, the noise had fluctuating characteristics, which led us to conclude that the noise caused discomfort...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the most}} visible and least {{monitored}} elements of our national security infrastructure are the poles and towers used for the distribution of our nation’s electrical power. Issues surrounding these elements within the United States include safety such as unauthorized climbing and access, vandalism such as nut/bolt removal or destructive small arms fire, and major vandalism such as the downing of <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and towers by the cutting of the poles with a chainsaw or torches. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has an ongoing research program working to develop inexpensive and sensitive sensor platforms for the monitoring and characterization of damage to the power distribution infrastructure. This presentation covers {{the results from the}} instrumentation of a variety of <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and wires with geophone assemblies and the recording of vibration data when <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> were subjected to a variety of stimuli.

500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying [...] "Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!" [...] Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E

50|$|Between November 25 and November 30, 2005, {{the town}} was often off the German power grid, and was the topic of {{national}} news. The cause was a heavy snow storm with very wet snow. The <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and cables between Gronau and Ochtrup were encrusted with {{a thick layer of}} ice. Due to the increased weight and the heavy storm most <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> toppled. Emergency generators from all regions of Germany were installed and operated in the following days and weeks. Dairy farmers were economically impacted as were other companies in the area. The collapse of the <b>power</b> <b>poles,</b> even today, is not completely understood.
