5|$|A loyal clubman, Trumble {{served on}} the {{committee}} of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association {{after a period of}} some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> visit to Queensland.

5|$|Against Arkansas, Cody {{dominated}} Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and {{helped the}} Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line {{late in the}} first half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 yards rushing. In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} time in its history, the Scottish Cup Final was <b>played</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday in 2013.

5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

The demo was first placed on the North American store, and was initially region-locked such that it would only <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> North American PS3. However, this was later confirmed as a mistake, as the developers were apparently unaware that people from different regions could sign up for a North American account and download the demo; a region-free demo was released soon after.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull had an {{opportunity}} to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria played them for the second time ahead of the final Test. While his state was unable to force a result, Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out.

5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stage set in a theatre or the streets of London.

She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|Federer and Andre Agassi played {{each other}} 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's {{retirement}} in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8–3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with an all-time great {{player of the}} previous generation. They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two days with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final match was {{at one of the}} most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the 2005 US Open. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J.

Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told {{they were going to}} <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Jim Reeves session.

5|$|Ternent allowed Swan to <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – {{just to be able to}} say they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract until the end of the season.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{won their}} seventh {{game in a}} row against the Bills in Cleveland. Edgar Jones scored the Browns' first {{touchdown}} on the team's third offensive <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 35-yard pass from Graham. Motley fumbled on the Browns' next possession, however, and the Bills capitalized on the mistake. After several running plays brought {{the ball to the}} Browns' 22-yard line, quarterback Jim Still threw to Al Baldwin for a touchdown that evened the score. A Groza field goal and a short touchdown run by Motley later in the first quarter put the Browns up by 10 points at halftime. Cleveland retained the lead {{for the rest of the}} game as end Mac Speedie caught touchdown passes in the third and fourth quarters. Graham ended the game with 11 completions for 189 yards and two touchdowns. Speedie, who was leading the league in receiving, added seven receptions for 140 yards. While the Bills lost, second-string quarterback George Ratterman, who came in for Still in the second quarter, put in a strong performance, completing 13 passes for 174 yards. His totals included a touchdown throw to Lou Tomasetti in the fourth quarter, when the game was out of reach.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E
5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by giving each of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two new vehicles, the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the new vehicles did not feel out of place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that staying true to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given more freedom to explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E
