This study sought to investigate the spectrum of volume alterations in a population of alcoholics with only alcohol dependence, <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abusing</b> alcoholics, and a comparison population of healthy controls. MethodThirty-seven ‘pure’ alcoholics, 93 <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abusing</b> alcoholics, and 69 healthy controls underwent structural T 1 MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate gray matter alterations. ResultsAlcoholic dependent inpatients (both with and without a history of DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence diagnosis) displayed significant gray matter differences in the mesial region of the frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. ‘Pure’ alcoholics exhibited a pattern of subcortical changes similar to that seen in Wernicke–Korsakoff Syndrome when compared to <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abusing</b> alcoholics. ‘Pure’ alcoholics and <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abusing</b> alcoholics did not differ significantly in measures of cortical gray matter, liver function, or nutrition. ConclusionsThese findings reinforce the accepted literature in regards to frontal lobe gray matter atrophy in alcohol dependence. This study calls for additional research in order to investigate the spectrum from uncomplicated alcoholism to Wernicke–Korsakoff Syndrome. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact cause of this pattern of differences and to determine what factors are responsible for the patterns of gray matter reduction or difference in ‘pure’ and <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abusing</b> alcoholics...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Chronic <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> (SUD) is {{associated}} with neurophysiological and neuroanatomical changes. Neurocognitive impairment tends to affect quality of life, occupational functioning, {{and the ability to}} benefit from therapy. Neurocognitive assessment is thus of importance, but costly and not widely available. Therefore, in a busy clinical setting, procedures that include readily available measures targeting core cognitive deficits would be beneficial. This paper investigates the utility of psychometric tests and a questionnaire-based inventory to assess “hot” and “cold” neurocognitive measures of executive functions (EF) in adults with a substance use disorder. Hot decision-making processes are associated with emotional, affective, and visceral responses, while cold executive functions are associated with rational decision-making. Material and Methods Subjects with <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> (n = 126) and healthy controls (n = 32) were compared on hot (Iowa Gambling Task) and cold (Stroop and the Trail Making Test) measures of EF, in addition to a questionnaire assessing everyday EF related problems (BRIEF-A; Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function – Adult, self-report version). Information about the substance abuse and social adjustment were assessed by self-report. Logistic regression analyses were applied to assess independent correlates of SUD status and social adjustment. A multiple linear regression was performed to predict the number of previous treatment attempts. Results The psychometric test of hot EF (the Iowa Gambling Task) did not differentiate the patients with <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> from controls, and was not associated with social adjustment.

This study {{sought to}} {{describe}} the drugs used by drug injectors infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to determine factors associated with the primary injection drug used. METHODS. A cross-section of persons 18 {{years of age or}} older reported with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to local health departments in 11 US states and cities was surveyed. RESULTS. Of 4162 persons interviewed, 1147 (28 %) reported ever having injected drugs. Of these 1147 injectors, 72 % primarily injected a drug other than heroin. However, the types of drugs injected varied notably by place of residence. Heroin was the most commonly injected drug in Detroit (94 %) and Connecticut (48 %); cocaine was the most common in South Carolina (64 %), Atlanta (56 %), Delaware (55 %), Denver (46 %), and Arizona (44 %); speedball was most common in Florida (46 %); and amphetamines were most common in Washington (56 %). Other determinants of the type of drug primarily injected were often similar by region of residence, except for heroin use. <b>Polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> was common; 75 % injected more than one type of drug, and 85 % reported noninjected drug use.

40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to drugs of abuse conditions individuals {{to anticipate the}} behavioral consequences of drug use specifically {{in the presence of}} a drug-associated context. In rodents, preferences and aversions for alcohol and cocaine have been conditioned; however, the mechanisms underlying the expression of these conditioned effects remain unknown. Given that alcohol and cocaine <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> is prevalent in young individuals, with more than 50 % of these polysubstance abusers reporting to be under the age of 21, it is important to understand the mechanisms contributing to the behavioral effects of alcohol and cocaine co-dependency. Aim 1 determined if age differentially impacted the effects of repeated alcohol exposure on conditioned cocaine preferences. Adolescent [postnatal day (PND) 30) and adult (PND 60) male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered ethanol (0. 5 or 1. 75 g/kg, i. p.) immediately before each cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) session (20 mg/kg, i. p.; 15 minutes). Aim 2, Experiments 1 and 2, identified the role of NMDA receptors within the nucleus accumbens septi (NAcc) in conditioned ethanol/cocaine behavior. Adolescent and adult rats in Experiment 1 were administered the NMDA antagonist MK- 801 (0. 1 or 0. 2 m/kg, i. p.) 30 minutes prior to cocaine conditioning. Adolescent and adult rats within Experiment 2 underwent bilateral cannulation for chronic implantation of the cannulae into the NAcc of both hemispheres. Rats administered 1 mM MK- 801 or saline into the NAcc prior to cocaine (20. 0 mg/kg, i. p.) conditioning, completed additional testing to determine the role of NAcc NMDA receptors in the consolidation, reconsolidation and expression of cocaine conditioned behavior in a drug-induced reactivation manner. Findings show adolescent and adult rats responded similarly to co-administration of ethanol/cocaine with both ages showing a decrease in the rewarding properties of cocaine. What differed between the age groups were the aversive properties of ethanol, with adolescents being less sensitive to the aversive properties of ethanol and its modulating effects on cocaine reward. A role for the NAcc NMDA receptors was observed in contributing to the modulating effects of ethanol on cocaine reward. Lastly, the reconsolidation of cocaine reward was more sensitive to disruption in adolescent rats, as compared to their adult counterparts. These results suggest an increased vulnerability for adolescents to continue engaging in <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, this at-risk age group also appeared to be more responsive to pharmacological treatment in decreasing addictive behavior...|$|E
40|$|Background: Opioid {{addiction}} and overdose {{is a serious}} problem worldwide. Fatal overdoses from opioids are responsible for numerous deaths and are increasing, especially if taken in combination with other psychoactive substanc-es. Combined with environmental exposure, opioid overdose can cause profound hypothermia. Opioid abuse and other drugs of abuse impair thermoregulation, leading to severe hypothermia. Both drug overdose and severe hypothermia can cause cardiac arrest. Case Report: We report a case of 20 -year-old man with history of <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> presenting with severe hypothermia and asystole of unknown duration with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) achieved after 28 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine, heroin, and benzodiazepine, along with positive blood alcohol level. The patient was rewarmed using non-invasive techniques. Hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), severe rhabdomyolysis, severe hyperkalemia, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), shock liver, coagulopathy, and aspiration pneumonia. Conclusions: Survival with full cardiovascular and neurologic recovery after a cardiac arrest caused by drug overdose in the setting of severe hypothermia is still possible, even if the cardiac arrest is of unknown or prolonged duration. Patients with severe hypothermia experiencing cardiac arrest/hemodynamic instability can be rewarmed us...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE) {{can cause}} persistent neuropsychological and motor abnormalities in affected children, but the physiological consequences of PCE remain unclear. Conclusions drawn from clinical studies {{can sometimes be}} confounded by <b>polysubstance</b> <b>abuse</b> and nutritional deprivation. However, existing observations suggest that cocaine exposure in utero, as in adults, increases synaptic dopamine and promotes enduring dopaminedependent plasticity at striatal synapses, altering behaviors and basal ganglia function. Methods: We used a combination of behavioral measures, electrophysiology, optical imaging, and biochemical and electrochemical recordings to examine corticostriatal activity in adolescent mice exposed to cocaine in utero. Results: We show that PCE caused abnormal dopamine-dependent behaviors, including heightened excitation following stress and blunted locomotor augmentation after repeated treatment with amphetamine. These abnormal behaviors were consistent with abnormal c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron function, which promoted a reversible depression in corticostriatal activity. PCE hyperpolarized and reduced tonic GABA currents in both fastspiking and persistent low-threshold spiking type GABA interneurons to increase tonic inhibition at GABA B receptors on presynaptic corticostriatal terminals. Although D 2 receptors paradoxically increased glutamate release following PCE, normal corticostriatal modulation by dopamine was reestablished with a GABAA receptor antagonist. Interpretation: The dynamic alterations at corticostriatal synapses that occur in response to PCE parallel the reported effect...|$|E
