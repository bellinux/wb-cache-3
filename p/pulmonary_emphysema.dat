Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema.</b> In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Pulmonary</b> {{interstitial}} <b>emphysema</b> is {{a serious}} complication of mechanical ventilation and can become life-threatening if progression occurs. Therapeutic lung puncture is a treatment option for severe <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema</b> but has a limited use in babies with extremely low birth weight. We present a case of <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema</b> in a Japanese baby (1 -day-old) boy with extremely low birth weight. The emphysema was successfully decompressed by therapeutic lung puncture performed with a trocar catheter. Case presentation The baby {{was born with a}} weight of 420 g, which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, is the lowest reported birth weight among babies with <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema.</b> A chest X-ray on postnatal day 2 revealed <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema,</b> which gradually progressed to diffuse pseudocystic changes. His condition became life-threatening despite the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and lateral decubitus positioning. We evacuated the <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema</b> by lung puncture with a trocar catheter to avoid respiratory and cardiovascular collapse. This resulted in adequate evacuation of the emphysema and a dramatic improvement in his clinical condition. Conclusions Therapeutic lung puncture performed with a trocar catheter is beneficial in babies with extremely low birth weight and diffuse <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema.</b> This treatment option may be broadly applicable, especially in an emergency situation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Pulmonary</b> {{interstitial}} <b>emphysema</b> is {{a life-threatening}} form of ventilator-induced lung injury. We present {{one of the}} few reported adult cases of <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema</b> in a woman with respiratory failure admitted to our intensive care unit. Case presentation An 87 -year-old Caucasian woman with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was admitted to our intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation. The combination of a poor oxygenation index and bilateral alveolar/interstitial infiltrates on a chest radiograph fulfilled the criteria for adult respiratory distress syndrome; the cause was thought to be a combination of the direct pneumonic pulmonary injury and extrapulmonary severe sepsis. By day seven, the fraction of inspired oxygen, peak airway and positive end expiratory pressures weaned sufficiently to allow an uncomplicated percutaneous tracheostomy. On day 10, problems with ventilation necessitated recruitment maneuvers with a Mapleson C circuit, after which dramatic surgical emphysema was noted. An upper airway bronchoscopy showed no obvious tracheal wall injury, and computed tomography of her chest showed extensive surgical emphysema, perivascular emphysema and peribronchial emphysema, which were consistent with a diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema.</b> Over the following days, despite protective ventilatory strategies and intercostal tube thoracostomy, lung compliance along with oxygenation deteriorated and our patient died on day 14. Conclusion The development of <b>pulmonary</b> interstitial <b>emphysema</b> is a rare but real risk when caring for patients with worsening lung compliance on the intensive care unit. Improved awareness of the condition, early protective ventilation strategies and timely treatment of any of the lethal complications will hopefully result in improved survival from the condition in adults. </p...|$|R
