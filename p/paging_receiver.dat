50|$|Digital {{systems may}} {{communicate}} text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for {{a call and}} any related details. The tow truck driver may press an acknowledge button, sending data {{in the opposite direction}} and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send radio paging messages which can either 1) beep a <b>paging</b> <b>receiver,</b> 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} to {{the single}} tone scheme was seen in one-way <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> In some two-tone sequential systems, sending 4-8 seconds of the second tone <b>pages</b> all <b>receivers</b> which have a code including the second tone. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} long tone B. Receivers made by Plectron and often used to page volunteer firefighters use a long single tone. The decoder in the typical Plectron receiver would not decode the tone as a valid call unless it was present for at least two to four seconds, (a very long variation of the burst tone).|$|R

40|$|Circuit {{requirements}} of a direct-conversion FLEX <b>paging</b> <b>receiver</b> with the zero-crossing interpolation demodulator are derived by means of high-level simulation. Impacts of the limitations on noise and nonlinearity characteristics of the radio frequency (RF) stage, the in-phase and quadrature-phase mismatch, and the local oscillator frequency drift are analyzed relative to the degradation of the bit error rate. Official specifications on radio paging receivers are introduced to ensure the minimum performance. It is shown that an RF front end with 25 -dB gain, 5. 3 -dB noise figure, and 11 -dBm second order intercept point makes the receiver qualified for the sensitivity, desensitization, and intermodulation requirements...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{overview}} {{of a number of}} investigations on antenna systems and related subjects over a period of 28 years, which has resulted in 44 publications in the technical literature, one current patent, and an M. Sc. thesis. The investigations have been grouped into 7 categories: -	Log periodic antennas, -	Antenna performance measurement techniques, -	Spacecraft Antenna Systems, -	Satcom Terminal Antennas, -	Transmission lines and baluns, -	High Radar Cross Section Reflectors for Spaceborne Radar Calibration, -	Miscellaneous Antenna Investigations. These investigations have resulted in various outcomes: in new antenna types and in improved antenna configurations; in improved techniques for antenna rf performance evaluation; in new knowledge relating to materials used with spacecraft antenna systems; in the development of computer software and computer-numerical methods for specific purposes; and in the advancement of accurate radar cross section prediction methods for spaceborne radar calibration targets. In the discipline of log-periodic antennas, a planar 'printed circuit 1 antenna structure has been devised which has a toroidal shaped radiation pattern distribution with horizontal linear polarization. A non-planar form of this radiating structure with a unidirectional beam has also been demonstrated. Some new techniques for measuring the rf characteristics of antenna systems have been devised. These include special techniques for frequency scaled ship model hf radar antenna measurements, and techniques for measuring scattering from the feed support struts of large Earth station parabolic reflector antennas. A novel method of acquiring near field phase and amplitude data using an interference technique for determining antenna far field performance characteristics by near field to far field data processing transformation has been demonstrated. Correction factors which allow gain comparison measurements to be made in short range length facilities, such as certain types of anechoic chamber, have also been presented. Antenna measurement techniques which are applicable to spacecraft antenna systems have been reviewed. With regard to spacecraft antenna systems, a number of diverse studies have been carried out, one of which has resulted in the composition of a mathematical procedure for predicting the complex beamshapes of contoured beam satellite reflector antenna systems. Also, experimental work has been described which showed that spacecraft reflector antennas constructed with carbon fibre reinforced plastics do not require metallic surface coatings, and that thermal control paint applied to spacecraft does not cause antenna performance degradation. Other programmes of research involved VHP turnstile antenna systems on large satellites, and future technology, geostationary orbit multi-role satellites with 'plug-in' payloads. New satcom terminal antenna configurations has been a very important area of research, resulting in high performance circularly polarized antenna configurations for small terminals for maritime, aeronautical and land-mobile applications. A patent has also been granted on a very compact antenna system for a satellite <b>paging</b> <b>receiver.</b> Many types of antenna require a balun system of some type, often with impedance transformation, for excitation of the radiating elements. A mathematical analysis which allows the design of one type of impedance transforming balun has been presented, and a new microstrip and coaxial cable balun system with progressive quadrature phase output (for the excitation of quadrifilar antennas) has been demonstrated. Very large radar cross section (RCS) passive radar reflectors are used for the monostatic calibration of spaceborne synthetic aperture radars on Earth resource monitoring satellites. A computer-numerical technique for accurately determining the RCS of these large reflectors was devised and has been extensively used. Other aspects of large radar reflector operation were also investigated, such as RCS reduction due to construction errors and radome covers Publications relating to a number of other miscellaneous antenna investigations are also included in this thesis. Among these are descriptions and performance details of choked waveguide and printed dipole feeds for parabolic reflector antennas, a special purpose antenna for a remotely piloted vehicle, and some results from an investigation on a double offset reflector antenna system. The publications which are the subject of this thesis, are introduced here in their historical context, and are presented in the Appendix at the back of this volume...|$|E
50|$|In {{professional}} {{two-way radio}} systems, a base station {{is used to}} maintain contact with a dispatch fleet of hand-held or mobile radios, and/or to activate one-way <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> The base station is {{one end of a}} communications link. The other end is a movable vehicle-mounted radio or walkie-talkie. Examples of base station uses in two-way radio include the dispatch of tow trucks and taxicabs.|$|R
50|$|Two-tone sequential, {{also known}} as 1+1, is a {{selective}} calling method originally used in one-way, tone-and-voice <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> Many companies have their own names for two-tone sequential options. General Electric Mobile Radio called it Type 99. Motorola called it Quik-Call II. For example, the encoder sends a single tone followed by 50 to 1,000 milliseconds of silence and then a second tone. Decoders look for a valid first tone followed by a valid second tone within a defined length of time, (a time window). For example, a decoder detecting a valid first tone might allow up to 2 seconds for a valid second tone to be decoded. If no valid second tone is decoded within 2 seconds, the decoder resets and waits for another valid first tone.|$|R
50|$|Quik-Call I, {{also known}} as 2+2, is a {{selective}} calling method originally used in one-way <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> The Quik-Call name is a trademark of Motorola. It sends a pair of tones followed by 50 to 1,000 milliseconds of silence and then a second pair of tones. Decoders look for a valid first tone pair followed by a valid second tone pair within a defined length of time, (a time window). For example, a decoder detecting a valid first tone pair might allow up to 2 seconds for a valid second tone pair to be decoded. If no valid second tone is decoded within 2 seconds, the decoder resets and waits for another valid first tone pair. The system is less susceptible to falsing because it employs pairs of tone decoders that must detect valid tone pairs simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|<b>Paging</b> <b>receivers</b> {{often have}} {{to work in a}} dense signal environment. This poses high demands on the {{preselection}} filter. One of the most difficult aspects is the large image rejection demand, which only can be satisfied by use of a narrow-band or high-Q filter. The practical restrictions for possible filter implementations are the low cost, low power and the small size of the pager. By use of positive feedback around a cheap off-chip low-Q inductor we obtain an enhanced quality factor. We are therefore able to construct selective filters using cheap small-size inductors. The price paid for Q-enhancement is a larger noise and higher sensitivity to component variations. The higher noise influence is eliminated using a high gain in the preceding LNA-stage, which is considered a part of the filter. Simulated results are: Q enhanced from 30 to 100, Image-rejection = 48 dB, f 0 = 280 MHz, Voltage-gain = 20 dB, Noise- figure = 2. 4 dB, IMFDR = 66 dB, IDD = 1 mA, VDD = 2 V. The original contribution of this work is the application of the enhancement principle to off-chip components, which benefits the minimization of size and cost...|$|R
40|$|As {{the radio}} paging system is {{upgraded}} from POCSAG {{to the high}} speed FLEX or ERMES protocol, both the modulation level and the baud rate are increased. What is unchanged is the available bandwidth. Consequently, the modulation index is decreased and additional difficulties are imposed {{on the design of}} a direct-conversion receiver. The main problems are (1) there are no mature demodulation techniques available for zero-IF M-ary FSK signals, and (2) the signal contains strong DC/low-frequency energy and hence DC offset cancellation is no longer an easy task. In this dissertation, a direct-conversion receiver is designed for high speed 4 FSK radio paging applications. Various design considerations are discussed and analyzed. A zero-crossing based counting/comparing scheme is chosen for the demodulation. The BER is improved by a novel zero-crossing interpolation technique. Following official specifications on radio <b>paging</b> <b>receivers,</b> a high level simulation is carried out to verify the demodulator performance and derive circuit requirements. The self-mixing-related time-varying offset is suppressed by the harmonic mixer to the noise level. A differential peak alignment method is developed to cancel the mismatch-induced static offset. A frame-by-frame scheme is also proposed for further offset reduction. A prototype receiver is fabricated in a 0. 35 micron CMOS process, with all major building blocks included. The front-end consists of a differential LNA and a quadrature harmonic mixer. In the base-band, an AGC circuit provides over 30 dB gain tuning range. The channel selection is done by a 5 th order gyrator filter. The demodulator is formed by a l-level zero-crossing interpolator, clock recovery circuits and decision logics. Main functions of the receiver has been verified...|$|R
40|$|Compact, highly {{customizable}} digital receivers {{are being}} developed for the system described in 'Radar Interferometer for Topographic Mapping of Glaciers and Ice Sheets' (NPO- 43962), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 7 (August 2007), <b>page</b> 72. The <b>receivers</b> are required to operate in unison, sampling radar returns received by the antenna elements in a digital beam-forming (DBF) mode. The design of these receivers could also be adapted to commercial radar systems. At the time of reporting the information for this article, there were no commercially available digital receivers capable of satisfying all of the operational requirements and compact enough to be mounted directly on the antenna elements. A provided figure depicts the overall system of which the digital receivers are parts. Each digital receiver includes an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a demultiplexer (DMUX), and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The ADC effects 10 -bit band-pass sampling of input signals having frequencies up to 3. 5 GHz. The input samples are demultiplexed at a user-selectable rate of 1 : 2 or 1 : 4, then buffered in part of the FPGA that functions as a first-in/first-out (FIFO) memory. Another part of the FPGA serves as a controller for the ADC, DMUX, and FIFO memory and as an interface between (1) {{the rest of the}} receiver and (2) a front-panel data port (FPDP) bus, which is an industry-standard parallel data bus that has a high data-rate capability and multichannel configuration suitable for DBF. Still other parts of the FPGA in each receiver perform signal-processing functions. The digital receivers can be configured to operate in a stand-alone mode, or in a multichannel mode as needed for DBF. The customizability of the receiver makes it applicable to a broad range of system architectures. The capability for operation of receivers in either a stand-alone or a DBF mode enables the use of the receivers in an unprecedentedly wide variety of radar systems...|$|R
