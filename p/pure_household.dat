40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{estimation}} of annual amount of waste generated by households in Republic of Serbia. Waste generated by households is a part of municipal waste that also includes waste generated by trade and services activities as well as by tourists. In order to estimate <b>pure</b> <b>household</b> waste, regression analysis was preformed with reference to Cammarota et al. (2005) ”A proposal for the estimation of household waste”. In order to face this problem, regression models were constructed for municipal waste that are based on non domestic variables which are related to trade and services activities and tourism. The part of the municipal waste that could not be explained by a model based on non domestic variables was ascribed to <b>pure</b> <b>household</b> waste. In order to check validity of results, the model residuals were then related to domestic variables (usual population and the average number of inhabitants per occupied dwelling). The regression models were fitted using R software...|$|E

Because of reduced {{reliance on the}} official classification of commodities as durable or nondurable, a considerable increase in ability to explain {{consumer expenditure}}s results as compared to multiequation models. Further empirical investigation provides strong evidence that: (1) private sector income is significantly better than disposable personal income for explaining consumer expenditures, (2) the M 1 definition of money is similarly superior to both M 2 and M 3 definitions, and (3) the weight of current income in permanent income is about 10 % per annum.

40|$|In {{this study}} the author {{presents}} {{a part of}} the results from the project »Problems of cooperativism and cooperation in Slovenia«. In this he uses the statistical data rahter than the empirical results. He analyses the following: global changes in population structure of SR Slovenia, changes in structure of agricultural households, changes in the size of farms, sources and structure of income in agricultural households, as well as the structure of consumption in agricultural and part- -time households. The author has established that in the villages of SR Slovenia a process of dissolving of the agricultural population is talcing place. As the number of <b>pure</b> agricultural <b>households</b> is decreasing, the number of »proletarian« households is increasing. The intermediate stratum of part-time farmes — part- -tirne workers is very numerous. Urbanization is not due to stronger concentration of population in towns, but to the fact that villages are becoming urbanized. The rural population is, namely, leaving agriculture as a profession, and is taking jobs in non-agricu 2 ̆ 7 Itural activities, remainig, however, to live mostly in the village. Therefore, the Slovenian village of today is no more a synonym for a rural settlement. Out of the total of 515 thousands of households in SR Slovenia only 12 percent are agricultural, 14 percent are part-time agricultural and 74 percent are non-agricultural. Agricultural households are rapidly changing into part- -time ones, in order to finally become non-agricultural. The number of active members in agricultural households stagnates, so that today there are mostly elder people. In mixed households women are those, who mostly work on the farm and in the barnyard. Agricultural households, without regard to the existing unfavourable structure of workers, live today much better than before, due to the specialization in agricultural production and placing on market of surplus- goods. The money, earned in this way, is being invested Into agricultural expanded reproduction and furnishing of farms and only after this, into housing construction and savings. The part-time agricultural households (whose financial consumption is larger than in agricultural ones) invest also mostly into furnishing of farms, although less than agricultural households. However, mixed households invest more in the increase of housing standard and in furnishing of households than agricultural ones do, and their installments as well as savings are higher. Shortly, part-time agricultural households in Slovenia live today considerably better than <b>pure</b> agricultural <b>households...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background The PURE {{study was}} {{established}} to investigate associations between social, behavioural, genetic, and environmental factors and cardiovascular diseases in 17 countries. In this analysis we compare the age, sex, urban/rural, mortality, and educational profiles of the PURE participants to national statistics. Methods PURE employed a community-based sampling and recruitment strategy where urban and rural communities were selected within countries. Within communities, representative samples of adults aged 35 to 70 years and their household members (n = 424, 921) were invited for participation. Results The <b>PURE</b> <b>household</b> population compared to national statistics had more women (sex ratio 95. 1 men per 100 women vs 100. 3) and was older (33. 1 years vs 27. 3), although age had a positive linear {{relationship between the two}} data sources (Pearson's r = 0. 92).

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the size of}} inheritance and gift flows in Germany for selected years over the last century, applying the methodology used by Piketty (2011) for France and combining national accounts, tax statistics and survey data (mainly the German Socio-Economic Panel, SOEP). The data clearly supports the finding of a U-shaped evolution. The annual flow of inheritance and gifts was almost 15 % of national income in 1911 and declined to less then 2 % {{by the middle of}} the last century. Over the last five decades, it has risen steadily to over 10 % of national income in recent years, amounting to Euro 220 billion in 2009. The pattern is close to the evolution in France, but at a slightly lower level. Evidence on transfers based on <b>pure</b> <b>household</b> survey data or inheritance tax statistics yields much lower values. We can decompose the gap between the taxed and the aggregate inheritance flow: controlling for valuation and tax evasion effects, the taxed flow would be at least twice as high; tax exemption effects account for the rest...|$|E

50|$|According to verse 42:23 and hadith of Ghadir, {{the prophet}} called the Muslims to love his <b>pure,</b> infallible <b>Household.</b> Al-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Fakhru'd-Din ar-Razi state that verse 5:55 is {{revealed}} about Ali. The verse implies that Allah and His prophet is the Wali and the holders {{of the authority}} of the Muslims and the believers must accept their Wila. This bond of love further causes that the Muslims follow their speeches, deeds, behaviors. In Quran, the term walayah is used in conjunction with nusrah and it is not only used in relation to God but also is used for those who have perfect devotion to God. Some traditions state that the verse 7:172 deals with the primordial pact (mithaq) that God has taken for His Lordship and the Walayah to the prophet and the ahl al-Bayt. In the Quran, the term shows a link between faithfulness to God and devotion {{to the members of the}} community. Tabatabaei claims that wherever Quran ascribes the guardianship for the prophet, it means authority and devotion. By the verse 5:55, he claims that as the word Walayah once is used for Allah and His messenger and those who have believed, though they are under His Guardianship and at last he proves that the prophet's obedience is God's obedience.|$|R
40|$|Subsistence fishery {{has long}} had an important, if neglected, role in Pacific Island economies and societies. In its pure form, {{subsistence}} fishery is defined as conducting fishing activity where all the catch is consumed by the fisher {{and his or her}} family, or given away to friends and relatives, or used ceremonially but not sold. Subsistence sector is defined as that part of the economy in which the economic activity is not monetised. In other words, the strict theoretical view of subsistence fishing is that it is an activity where the production, consumption, and distribution are outside of the monetary system. In practice, {{there are only a few}} areas where there are <b>pure</b> subsistence <b>households</b> which do not rely on monetary exchange at all. In their report to the Forum Secretariat in 1992, Fisk, et al. defined the subsistence sector in the Pacific Islands as "that part of the economy where the most people produce, for their own consumption, most or a large part of their basic needs". Technically, then, this would mean mixed subsistence or semi-subsistence. This paper examines the status of the subsistence fishery, its socio-economic significance for Pacific Island economies and its potential in assisting coastal fisheries development. In doing so, the paper first illustrates the strategic importance of subsistence sector by looking at its role in the economic and social development of the Pacific Islands. Development is seen in terms of what is appropriate and practical within the given social, cultural, economic, environmental and ecological context. Subsistence fishery is then analysed in terms of its role within the fisheries sector in providing food and nutritional security, and social stability,and as a means of reducing risk and vulnerability within the coastal environment. The study also identifies some trends that are threatening the subsistence fishery and looks at possible ways to minimise the effects of such conditions...|$|R
60|$|And let me {{linger in}} this place, for an instant, to remark that if ever {{household}} affections and loves are graceful things, they are graceful in the poor. The {{ties that bind}} the wealthy and the proud to home may be forged on earth, but those which link the poor man to his humble hearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of Heaven. The man of high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of himself: as trophies of his birth and power; his associations with them are associations of pride and wealth and triumph; the poor man's attachment to the tenements he holds, which strangers have held before, and may to-morrow occupy again, has a worthier root, struck deep into a <b>purer</b> soil. His <b>household</b> gods are of flesh and blood, with no alloy of silver, gold, or precious stone; he has no property but in the affections of his own heart; and when they endear bare floors and walls, despite of rags and toil and scanty fare, that man has his love of home from God, and his rude hut becomes a solemn place.|$|R
40|$|In Denmark, we {{are able}} to provide {{ourselves}} completely with groundwater. In danish <b>households,</b> <b>pure</b> drinking water is used for both toilet flushing and laundry. If we did not have this ability, due to limited water resources, we would probably be forced into using alternative sources, such as rainwater and semi-clean wastewater from sinks and showers - also known as greywater. Recent studies of our groundwater inventory show, that an increasing demand on water supply, along with pollution from human activities, poses a threat to the available amount of drinking water in the years to come. Especially Copenhagen, with its high population density, is facing the exact issue at this point. By using rainwater harvesting- and greywater recycle systems our drinking water can be substituted in toilet cisterns and washing machines. In that way the groundwater resources can be spared. Sustainable use of groundwater resources can be put into practice by using treated greywater from showers for toilet flushing and treated rainwater for laundry. With a sustainable use of our drinking water and secondary water resources, we can ensure the demand of water in the future. This paper examines alternative water sources to be used in apartment buildings in Copenhagen, and compares experiences from other cities outside of Denmark. On this basis, we will try to develop a profitable plant with the purpose to partly provide apartment buildings with secondary water...|$|R
