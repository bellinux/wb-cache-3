Its membership includes academics, practising lawyers and prominent community members. The Commission has published reports covering subjects as diverse as commercial arbitration, data protection, divorce, sale of goods and supply of services, insolvency, fraud and statutory interpretation. The recommendations in many of its reports have been implemented, either {{in whole or in}} part. It is currently considering references on privacy, guardianship and custody, domicile, <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> advance directives, hearsay in criminal proceedings and conditional fees.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} of <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is a sub-rule of {{consideration}} because it restricts who can enforce {{an agreement to}} those who have brought consideration to the bargain. In an early case, Tweddle v Atkinson, it was held that because a son had not given any consideration for his father in law's promise to his father to pay the son £200, he could not enforce the promise. Given the principle that standing to enforce an obligation should reflect whoever has a legitimate interest in its performance, a 1996 report by the Law Commission entitled Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties, recommended that while courts should be left free to develop the common law, some of the more glaring injustices should be removed. This led to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Under section 1, a third party may enforce an agreement if it purports to confer a benefit on the third party, either individually or a member as a class, and there is no expressed stipulation that the person was not intended to be able to enforce it. In this respect there is a strong burden on the party claiming enforcement was not intended by a third party. A third party has the same remedies available as a person privy to an agreement, and can enforce both positive benefits, or limits on liability, such as an exclusion clause. The rights of a third party can then only be terminated or withdrawn without her consent if it is reasonably foreseeable that she would rely upon them.|$|E

50|$|A {{promise is}} {{enforceable}} {{if it is}} supported by consideration, that is, where consideration has moved from the promisee. For example, {{in the case of}} Tweddle v Atkinson, John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn't receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract,</b> that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract's terms. (Note that the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> has been somewhat altered by the <b>Contracts</b> (Rights <b>of</b> Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted.|$|R
2500|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> provides that {{only those who}} are {{party to a contract}} may sue or be sued on it. The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [...] immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [...] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite	 [...] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E
50|$|<b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contract</b> {{played a}} key role in the {{development}} of negligence as well. In the first case of Winterbottom v. Wright (1842), in which Winterbottom, a postal service wagon driver, was injured due to a faulty wheel, attempted to sue the manufacturer Wright for his injuries. The courts however decided that there was no <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> between manufacturer and consumer.|$|E
50|$|A tenant {{generally}} cannot {{transfer the}} tenancy or <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> estate {{between himself and}} his landlord without the landlord's consent. An assignee who comes into <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> estate is liable only while he {{continues to be the}} legal assignee: while he is in possession under the assignment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> {{estate is}} a [...] "mutual or {{successive}} {{relation to the}} same right in property" [...] such as {{the relationship between a}} landlord and tenant. Thus, <b>privity</b> <b>of</b> estate refers to the legal relationship that two parties bear when their estates constitute one estate in law.|$|R

2500|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, one {{squatter}} {{may or may}} {{not pass}} along continuous possession to another squatter, known as [...] "tacking". Tacking is defined as [...] "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." [...] There are three types <b>of</b> Privity: <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Contract; <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Possession; and <b>Privity</b> <b>of</b> Estate. [...] One of the three types <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> is required in order for one adverse possessor to [...] "tack" [...] their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating [...] "color of title." [...] A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary [...] "continuous and hostile" [...] element.

500|$|A {{collateral}} {{contract is}} a contract where the consideration is the entry into another subordinate contract, which co-exists {{side by side}} with the main contract.

40|$|Privity and the inter-twined {{notion of}} {{consideration}} are key {{features of the}} classical Common law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The need to protect reasonable expectations has created problems for Common law courts in the past, however, leading to adaptation of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> by both precedent and statute in many jurisdictions. This paper will move beyond the Common law in its analysis, however, {{through the use of}} both comparative law and sociolegal theory. The target jurisdictions of Australia and South Africa have both historically been strongly influenced by the English Common law <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> but South Africa is a mixed legal system and Australian law has also developed along an independent path, particularly with regard to the protection of reasonable expectations. Our analysis will be based around three specific case studies, in order to contextualize the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> and to describe the ‘law in action’, following an approach which draws on relational, or socially embedded, analysis. Our ultimate aim is to move from micro, black-letter case studies to an emergent macro picture. Given the (historically) cornerstone status <b>of</b> <b>privity</b> in the Common law, this will allow us to comment on themes such as convergence and divergence from the classical law <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> and will also give an insight into comparative legal culture and context in both target countries...|$|R
