The objectives were to (1) describe the ultrasound imaging equipment and settings used, (2) describe the fish handling procedures during imaging, and (3) illustrate image orientation {{with respect to the}} physical positioning of the probe and the catfish. Ultrasound images of the ovaries of channel catfish were recorded as digital video recordings (audio video interleave format) and as still images (ultrasound image format files). This study integrated the use of nonanesthetized, submersed fish within a recirculating tank system or <b>portable</b> <b>container</b> and a submersed waterproof probe, which enabled us to use water as a transmission medium for ultrasound. This allowed us to image the fish in ventral recumbency (upright swimming position) without using a physical restraint in the tank system, or by positioning the fish in the <b>portable</b> <b>container</b> by adjusting the position of its caudal peduncle with one hand and that of the probe with the other hand. The ease of using this technique allows it to be employed as a systematic method for fish handling under laboratory and hatchery conditions.

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{theories}} that attempt to explain hand preference in non-human primates-the `task complexity' theory and the `postural origins' theory. In the present study, we proposed a third hypothesis to explain the evolutionary origin of hand preference in non-human primates, stating {{that it could have}} evolved owing to structural and functional adaptations to feeding, which we refer to as the `niche structure' hypothesis. We attempted to explore this hypothesis by comparing hand preference across species that differ in the feeding ecology and niche structure: red howler monkeys, Alouatta seniculus and yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos. The red howler monkeys used the mouth to obtain food more frequently than the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys. The red howler monkeys almost never reached for food presented {{on the opposite side of}} a wire mesh or inside a <b>portable</b> <b>container,</b> whereas the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys reached for food presented in all four spatial arrangements (scattered, on the opposite side of a wire mesh, inside a suspended container, and inside a <b>portable</b> <b>container).</b> In contrast to the red howler monkeys that almost never acquired bipedal and clinging posture, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys acquired all five body postures (sitting, bipedal, tripedal, clinging, and hanging). Although there was no difference between the proportion of the red howler monkeys and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys that preferentially used one hand, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys exhibited an overall weaker hand preference than the red howler monkeys. Differences in hand preference diminished with the increasing complexity of the reaching-for-food tasks, i. e., the relatively more complex tasks were perceived as equally complex by both the red howler monkeys and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys. These findings suggest that species-specific differences in feeding ecology and niche structure can influence the perception of the complexity of the task and, consequently, hand preference...|$|E

40|$|It {{was found}} out that {{in most cases the}} system of {{removable}} water disposal is arranged with violations, i. e. cesspools that collect runoffs are either not designed at all — waste water merge into an open trench (ditch), and then water is filtered into the ground, or are designed against the rules (instead of a cesspool the user presupposes a simple hole dug in the ground). The authors witnessed the cases of ingress of wastewater into open waters, near which holiday villages are situated. This fact raises the question on the necessity of solving these problems which will prevent pollution of soil and surface waters, as well as the surrounding areas by sewages to prevent the development of infections and to prevent environmental disaster on a local scale. If you have a small rate of water flow in a summer cottage, it is feasible to design a sump for removal of faecal discharge (human physiological discharge), which are the most dangerous. It is advisable to install in the ground sealed (cumulative) capacity, and build headroom on the top {{in the form of a}} toilet cabin (detached structure). This will allow completely getting rid of contamination with sewage effluents. The volume of the tank must be calculated individually depending on the water consumption on the site. Periodically it is needed to call out a cesspoolage truck after filling the reservoir, which would be then emptied of faecal material.

5000|$|Enamels are {{considered}} a [...] "Minor Art" [...] because of their small size, which likely led to their increase in use as decoration for small, <b>portable</b> <b>containers</b> holding holy relics. In this tradition, many enameled pieces {{found their way to}} the western empire by way of pilgrimage and gifts from the imperial family in Constantinople. The high value and relatively small size of enamel pieces meant that they were made for an aristocratic audience, most likely commissioned by the imperial family, often as gifts for other royals or for the churches they patronized. For example, there is evidence that Emperor Justinian II (565-578) sent enamels to Queen Radegund of France. Another possible transmission for Byzantine enamels to the west {{came in the form of}} imperial marriages. In 927, the German Emperor Otto II married the niece of the Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces, princess Theophanu, and she supposedly introduced imperial goldsmiths and enamelers to the German church. Many famous examples of Byzantine enamel are staurothekes, relics containing fragments of the True Cross, which were greatly prized in both the east and the west, therefore more survive still in modern collections.

40|$|AbstractWinery {{wastewater}} poses {{a serious}} environmental problem, especially for small wineries whose yearly wastewater production and/or financial resources {{may not be}} sufficient to warrant advanced treatment plants. We constructed an integrated mobile system comprised of a coago-flocculation module using nanocomposites to reduce TSS, and two series of aerated cells to reduce COD, N, polyphenols, and P concentrations so effluents could be discharged into a municipal wastewater treatment plant or under special conditions, recycled for irrigation. Each series consists of four <b>portable</b> <b>containers</b> (1. 5 m 3) filled with volcanic tuff of a decreasing progressive particle-size structure and equipped with a forced-air apparatus to keep a minimum soluble oxygen level of 1. 5 mgL− 1. The key feature of the aerated cells is constant air transfer through the substrate which greatly increases treatment capacity. The entire system was mounted on two flat lorry beds equipped with a special hook for easy transportation. We tested the system during two consecutive vintage seasons in 2013 and 2014. The nanocomposite module reduced the TSS by more than 95 % while the aerated cells decreased the COD concentration to less than 700 mgL− 1 at the discharge point (90 – 95 % removal efficiency), which meets the stringent requirement for release to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. TP concentrations were reduced from a mean of 42 mgL− 1 in the first cells to 2. 2 mgL− 1 in the outlet of the system with an overall reduction efficiency of 95 %. The maximum COD loading rate was 8. 66 kgm 3 d− 1, a remarkably high rate considering the minimal operating area.
