50|$|Philippine cuisine has {{a variety}} of native {{ingredients}} used. The biota that developed yielded a particular landscape and in turn gave the place local ingredients that enhanced flavors to the dishes. Kalamansi is the more known of those ingredients, it is a fruit that belongs to the genus citrus. It is mostly used due to the sourness it gives to a dish. Another is the Tabon-tabon, a tropical fruit which were used by pre-colonial Filipinos as anti-bacterial ingredient especially in Kinilaw dishes. The country also cultivates different type of nuts {{and one of them is}} the <b>Pili</b> <b>nut,</b> which the Philippines is the only known edible exporter of. It is usually made as a merienda or is incorporated in other desserts to enhance the flavor due to the milky texture it gives off as it melts in the mouth. Tultul, a type of rock salt is another ingredient made only in Guimaras whom most use it to sprinkle on cooked rice to serve as a viand. The salt is an assortment of reeds, twigs and small pieces of bamboo carried to the shore by the sea tide where they have been soaked in seawater for some time and is then burned in large quantities while continually being doused with salt water on a daily basis. The ashes then is strained continuously by kaings and are then cooked in pans. In Visayas, another souring agent in dishes in the form of Batuan (Garcinia binucao) is used. It is a fruit that is greenish, yellowish, somewhat rounded, and four centimeters or more in diameter. They have a firm outer covering and contain a very acid pulp and several seeds.|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose: The pili tree is {{indigenous}} in the Philippines and {{can easily}} grow in tropical countries. This research work investigated {{the potential of}} pili pulp and <b>pili</b> <b>nut</b> oils {{for use in the}} nutraceutical and food industries. Methods: Physicochemical properties, triglyceride, fatty acid and unsaponifiable matter profiles of the enzymatically-produced pili pulp and nut oils were analyzed using standard methods. Results: The oil percentages are high and the fatty acid profiles of the oil samples show that oleic acid is the major fatty acid. In general, the samples are unsaturated which makes them potential materials for high-value specialty oil products. The unsaponifiable matter is higher in pili pulp oil than in <b>pili</b> <b>nut</b> oil. The lipid molecular species present in the unsaponifiable matter of the oils are carotenoids, tocopherols and sterols. Conclusion: The presence of these minor components in considerable amounts in the pulp and nut oils is very interesting because of the many health benefits that these oils can offer...|$|E
5000|$|In Indonesia, {{especially}} in Minahasa and Moluccas islands, the kernels {{are used for}} making cake, bobengka in Minahasan or bubengka in Maluku. Pili kernel is also used in chocolate, ice cream, and baked goods. The largest buyers of <b>pili</b> <b>nuts</b> are in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the kernel {{is one of the}} major ingredients in one type of the famous Chinese festive desserts known as the [...] "moon cake".|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} grown as {{ornamental}} trees {{in many areas}} of the Old World tropics of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, only the Philippines produces and processes <b>pili</b> <b>nuts</b> commercially. Production centers are located in the Bicol region, provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, and Camarines Sur, southern Tagalog, and eastern Visayas. There is no commercial planting of this crop, fruits are collected from natural stands in the mountains near these provinces. In 1977, the Philippines exported approximately 3.8 t of pili preparation to Guam and Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{species in}} the genus Canarium are used as edible fruits (for example, Canarium album, the Chinese olive) and <b>nuts</b> (<b>pili</b> <b>nuts,</b> Canarium ovatum). Species in the genus Bursera, {{especially}} the so-called elephant tree, grow primarily in Mexico, where their secretions are a raw material in making varnish. [...] The Maya also used a Bursera sp. to make incense. [...] However, the Bursera may also be considered an ornamental genus and a common representative {{of the family in}} the United States, especially in Florida (B. simaruba) and the Southwest (B. odorata, B. microphylla).|$|R
30|$|Figure  6 c {{depicts the}} Temkin {{isotherm}} plots for the atrazine uptake onto the UBC, 2 -ABC and 2 -BBC {{from which the}} relevant Temkin adsorption isotherm values are obtained and are shown with values of correlation coefficients in Table  1. The BT values indicate the heat of adsorption obtained as 136.46, 89.11 and 96.15 for UBC, 2 -ABC and 2 -BBC, respectively, while AT representing the equilibrium binding energy are 0.8851 (L/mg), 0.4190 (L/mg) and 0.4722 (L/mg) for UBC, 2 -ABC and 2 -BBC, respectively. Thus, these values imply that the atrazine is more strongly adsorbed on the UBC surface than that of 2 -ABC and 2 -BBC, indicating {{that there is a}} stronger interaction between atrazine and the respective bentonite clays. Similar results have been reported as per the adsorption of N-nitrophenol using <b>Pili</b> <b>nut</b> shell-derived active carbon (Nwosu et al. 2017). They reported BT value of 24.292 and AT value of 0.162.|$|E
5000|$|The {{agribusiness}} {{system in}} Niwelehu is separated into {{three types of}} commodities that allow to get harvest all year around. All the fishing {{is done in the}} Seram Sea north of Niwelehu, while all the farming is done in the forest south of Niwelehu. The first part of the agribusiness is based on agriculture of chilies, cassava plants and other horticulture plants. The second commodity is based on gardening of other crops such as mangoes, coconuts, coffee seeds, cocoa, durian, clove and nutmeg. Finally, the farmers also get forestry harvest like wood, sagu and  kenaris (<b>pili</b> <b>nuts).</b> The villagers use a rotation system that allows them to always keep the land healthy as it is the main source of income.|$|R
