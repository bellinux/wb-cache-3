5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E

All but implied criticism was to be avoided and the author was {{to resist the temptation}} to be [...] "wise after the event". Disclosure of facts about opponents was to be kept to small-type footnotes or notes at the end of chapters, because introducing facts not known at the time was hindsight, which was unfair and un-scholarly. A conclusion could be written for reflection and comment but not for fault- finding. For Edmonds, the constraints were necessary for the facts innocuously to be shown to the lay reader, yet be available to experts reading between the lines. After Henry FitzMaurice Stacke, the first author of Military Operations: East Africa, Volume I died and Charles Hordern was appointed as replacement, Hordern wrote that Stacke had been frustrated by being obliged to ...|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} multimedia systems, the synchronization <b>of</b> multimedia <b>information</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} important as well as difficult issues. In this paper, we propose three synchronization mechanisms and discuss how to implement these methods in our developed distributed hypermedia system Harmony. The proposed synchronization mechanisms are (1) point synchronization, (2) real-time synchronization, and (3) adaptive synchronization. Point synchronization realizes that the start/completion time <b>of</b> the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> multimedia <b>information</b> is synchronized with a certain specified point on the real time axis. Using this synchronization mechanism, the simultaneous start <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> multifarious <b>information</b> can be realized.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an inter-disciplinary study {{investigating}} user preferences and performance in relation to spoken in-car route guidance. In-car navigation systems are becoming increasingly popular. However, despite large amounts of research assessing the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>information,</b> and the usability and interaction issues surrounding the interfaces, there has been much less investigation of the impacts <b>of</b> auditory <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> route <b>information.</b> We addressed this issue using a multi-disciplinary approach to collect both qualitative and quantitative data through questionnaires and user experiments. Our research identified a user preference for auditory <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> route <b>information,</b> as well as a memory advantage for auditory over visual presentation. We also found that simple auditory route instructions could be followed without significant interference to a simulated driving task, whereas more complex auditory instructions did cause interference. Taken together, this research highlights the importance of the design of spoken route guidance instructions in minimising the cognitive demands that they impose...|$|R
