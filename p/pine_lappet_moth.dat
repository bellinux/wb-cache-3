40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the taxonomy, systematics, spreading and biology of the <b>lappet</b> <b>moths</b> and lemoniids in the Palearctic fauna. The {{aim is to}} develop the system of <b>lappet</b> <b>moths</b> in Palearctic fauna and to determine their place among complex of the near families. 5 species and 6 subspecies {{have been described as}} new ones for science, 2 tribes, 1 genus and 1 subgenus have been determined. The original system of <b>lappet</b> <b>moths</b> in the Golarctic fauna has been proposed. The phylogenetic connections of lasiocampoid complex with other bombicoid butteriflies have been made more accurate. The life cycle and biology of 19 species - potenial pests of forestry and agriculture have been studied. The information on the morphology of different organs has been generalized. The musculature of primitive <b>lappet</b> <b>moths</b> has been investigated firstly.

50|$|The Lasiocampidae are {{a family}} of moths also known as eggars, snout moths (although this also refers to the Pyralidae), or <b>lappet</b> <b>moths.</b> Over 2,000 species occur worldwide, and {{probably}} not all have been named or studied.|$|R
50|$|The small <b>lappet</b> <b>moth</b> (Phyllodesma ilicifolia) is {{a species}} of moth in the family Lasiocampidae.

50|$|The Cape <b>lappet</b> <b>moth</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1767 by Carl Linnaeus {{in the first}} volume of his 12th edition of Systema Naturae. As with the majority of moths that Linnaeus described, he placed E. capensis in the now obsolete genus Phalaena. The specific epithet he chose, capensis, presumably refers to the moth's distribution in the Western Cape of South Africa.|$|R
50|$|There {{is little}} {{agreement}} regarding {{the extent of}} the Cape <b>lappet</b> <b>moth's</b> range in southern Africa. While all sources agree that its primary geographical home is South Africa, varied sources also state Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Being able to feed {{on a wide variety of}} plants, the caterpillars are common in domestic gardens and also in more remote and wild areas.|$|R
50|$|Eutricha capensis, the Cape <b>lappet</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of moth in the family Lasiocampidae {{primarily}} found in South Africa. During the larval stage, cape lappets feed {{on a wide variety}} of African plants and can often be found aggregating in gardens. The caterpillars are brightly coloured and conspicuously hairy, while the bulky adult moths are mostly brown and much less striking in appearance.|$|R

50|$|The eastern tent {{caterpillar}} (Malacosoma americanum) is {{a species of}} moth in the family Lasiocampidae, the {{tent caterpillar}}s or <b>lappet</b> <b>moths.</b> It is univoltine, producing one generation per year. It is a tent caterpillar, a social species that forms communal nests in the branches of trees. It is sometimes confused with the gypsy moth and the fall webworm, and may be erroneously {{referred to as a}} bagworm, which is the common name applied to unrelated caterpillars in the family Psychidae. The moths oviposit almost exclusively on trees in the plant family Rosaceae, particularly cherry (Prunus) and apple (Malus). The caterpillars are hairy with areas of blue, white, black and orange. The blue and white colors are structural colors created by the selective filtering of light by microtubules that arise on the cuticle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{mitochondrial}} genome (mitogenome) {{characteristics of}} the monotypic Lasiocampoidea are largely unknown, because only limited number of mitogenomes is available from this superfamily. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitogenome of the <b>lappet</b> <b>moth,</b> Kunugia undans (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) and compared it to those of Lasiocampoidea and macroheteroceran superfamilies (59 species in six superfamilies). The 15, 570 -bp K. undans genome had one additional trnR that was located between trnA and trnN loci and this feature was unique in Macroheterocera, including Lasiocampoidea. Considering that the two trnR copies are located in tandem with proper secondary structures and identical anticodons, a gene duplication event might {{be responsible for the}} presence of the two tRNAs. Nearly all macroheteroceran species, excluding Lasiocampoidea, have a spacer sequence (1 – 34 bp) at the trnS 2 and ND 1 junction, but most lasiocampid species, including K. undans, have an overlap at the trnS 2 and ND 1 junction, which represents a different genomic feature in Lasiocampoidea. Nevertheless, a TTAGTAT motif, which is typically detected in Macroheterocera at the trnS 2 and ND 1 junction, was also detected in all Lasiocampoidea. In summary, the general mitogenome characteristics of Lasiocampoidea did not differ greatly from the remaining macroheteroceran superfamilies, but it did exhibit some unique features...|$|R
6000|$|The Rev. Joseph Greene {{has called}} {{attention}} to the striking harmony between the colours of those British moths which are on the wing in autumn and winter, and the prevailing tints of nature at those seasons. In autumn various shades of yellow and brown prevail, and he shows that out of fifty-two species that fly at this season, no less than forty-two are of corresponding colours. Orgyia antiqua, O. gonostigma, the genera Xanthia, Glæa, and Ennomos are examples. In winter, gray and silvery tints prevail, and the genus Chematobia and several species of Hybernia which fly during this season are of corresponding hues. No doubt if the habits of moths in a state of nature were more closely observed, we should find many cases of special protective resemblance. A few such have already been noticed. Agriopis aprilina, Acronycta psi, and many other moths which rest during the day {{on the north side of}} the trunks of trees can with difficulty be distinguished from the grey and green lichens that cover them. The <b>lappet</b> <b>moth</b> (Gastropacha querci) closely resembles both in shape and colour a brown dry leaf; and the well-known buff-tip moth, when at rest is like the broken end of a lichen-covered branch. There are some of the small moths which exactly resemble the dung of birds dropped on leaves, and on this point Mr. A. Sidgwick, in a paper read before the Rugby School Natural History Society, gives the following original observation:--"I myself have more than once mistaken Cilix compressa, a little white and grey moth, for a piece of bird's dung dropped upon a leaf, and vice versâ the dung for the moth. Bryophila Glandifera and Perla are the very image of the mortar walls on which they rest; and only this summer, in Switzerland, I amused myself for some time in watching a moth, probably Larentia tripunctaria, fluttering about quite close to me, and then alighting on a wall of the stone of the district which it so exactly matched as to be quite invisible a couple of yards off." [...] There are probably hosts of these resemblances which have not been observed, owing to the difficulty of finding many of the species in their stations of natural repose. Caterpillars are also similarly protected. Many exactly resemble in tint the leaves they feed upon; others are like little brown twigs, and many are so strangely marked or humped, that when motionless they can hardly be taken to be living creatures at all. Mr. Andrew Murray has remarked how closely the larva of the peacock moth (Saturnia pavonia-minor) harmonizes in its ground colour with that of the young buds of heather on which it feeds, and that the pink spots with which it is decorated correspond with the flowers and flower-buds of the same plant.|$|R
