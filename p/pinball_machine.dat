25|$|Solenoids or coils: These {{are found}} in every modern <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components.

The plunger is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.|$|E
25|$|Contact with or {{manipulation}} of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores {{points for the}} player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have {{been taken over by}} semiconductor chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> was used by Checkpoint and features also video mode minigames.

The Wizard of Oz is the first US <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> that used a LCD in the back box. It is not only used for scoring and mini-games but also to display full color videos. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like Baby Pac-Man in 1982 and Granny and the Gators in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> Dakar from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that utilizes a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.|$|E
