40|$|Although drivers park free 99 {{percent of}} all their trips, you {{probably}} feel that you <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking on more than 1 percent of your automobile trips, and perhaps you do. Many of us undoubtedly <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking more frequently than others do. Americans make 230 billion vehicle trips a year, so drivers <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking 2. 3 billion times a year (1 percent of 230 billion), but they also park free 228 billion times a year. If drivers don't <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking, who does? Initially, developers <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it when they provide all the parking spaces required by zoning ordinances. The cost of land and capital devoted to required parking raises the cost of all development, and this cost translates into higher prices for everything else, so everyone <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> parking indirectly. Residents <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking through higher prices <b>for</b> housing. Consumers <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking through higher prices for goods and services. Employers <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking through higher office rents. Only in our roles as motorists do we not <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> parking because motorists park free for most trips.

5|$|Diocletian's edicts {{emphasized}} the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public.

40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as {{they are willing to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its provision. Those with a higher income were willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

40|$|Current {{reforms in}} the public sector are {{characterized}} by the introduction of businesslike incentive structures, in particular the introduction of "pay for performance” schemes in public institutions. However, the public sector has some specific characteristics, which might restrict the naive adoption of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance. Our article analyzes whether the impact of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance is bound to conditions, and if this is the case, under which conditions <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance has a positive or a negative effect on performance. We explore this contingency in a meta-analytic review of previous experimental studies on the effects of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance. We further show why <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance sometimes negatively affects personal efforts. With an experimental vignette study we demonstrate (a) that motivation {{is likely to be a}} key influence on the effect of performance-related pay on performance, and (b) that <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance is generally more costly as it appears because it almost always produces hidden costs of rewards. Our findings help to explain the modest success of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance in the public secto...|$|R

5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
