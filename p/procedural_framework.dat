QAA was under contract to the Higher Education Funding Council for England to assess quality for English universities. This replaced Teaching Quality Assessments (TQAs) which aimed to assess the administrative, policy and <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> within which teaching took place and did not directly assess teaching quality. This inspection-based system {{was replaced by a}} system of information provision, including a national student survey. QAA publishes scores which have been used by the league table industry. The first Teaching Excellence Framework is to be published in 2017; this is a rating system (giving gold, silver or bronze ratings to higher education providers) rather than a ranking as such.|$|E

50|$|In 1977, an {{amendment}} lengthened the residency requirement for naturalization to 20 years (15 years if {{in service to}} Bhutan), and the requirement of owning agricultural land was eschewed. Deprivation of citizenship as a punishment for sedition was expanded to associates and family relatives of seditious citizens. The amendment introduced other requirements, such as knowledge of Dzongkha and adherence to Ngalop customs. The amendment also introduced a <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> for citizenship and naturalization; namely it codified procedural requirements for census registration and births abroad and designated the Ministry of Home Affairs as the government agency to oversee immigration matters.

40|$|Design – {{creativity}} {{deployed to}} a specific end – shapes innovative ideas to become practical and attractive propositions for users or customers. Security professionals need design for several reasons. Security products, secure buildings and security procedures need to be efficient, cost effective, reliable and durable {{in the face of}} ‘arms races’ with adaptive offenders against a background of continuous technological and social change. They must perform well whilst keeping adverse side effects to a minimum. Security moreover has to be delivered in a way which only minimally interferes with daily living and business activity, or conflicts with wider values ranging from sustainability to social inclusion. Security requirements have to be articulated clearly and inserted early in the design process to maximise available design options and to minimise costs and constraints; co-design between designers, security professionals and other stakeholders is the preferred way of working. This chapter describes how security and design inter-relate in all these ways and presents various conceptual and <b>procedural</b> <b>frameworks</b> to facilitate this understanding and underwrite the better design of security...|$|R
40|$|For a {{successful}} effectuation {{of the rights}} of EU citizens and third country nationals, it is crucially important that the rules and principles flowing from the European Treaties and the associated legislation are ensured in full. The available methods of public enforcement (in particular the monitoring powers of the Commission) are however insufficient to achieve that goal: compliance with the relevant European rules and norms also depends to a considerable extent on the policy dynamics, public infrastructure and (styles of) administrative governance of the country concerned. This paper attempts to fill a gap which is believed to lie between, on the one hand, leading political science theories on the reception of EU law in the Member States, and on the other, the main legal studies on the quality of legislation and the (in) adequacy of the existing <b>procedural</b> <b>frameworks</b> for effectuating citizens’ rights. The main objective is to explore alternative avenues for facilitating the interplay between the EU and the national legal orders. By providing vivid illustrations of existing bottlenecks, asymmetric centrifugal and centripetal forces and avoidable feedback-loops, it points out how current practices may be enhanced, and highlights possible new directions for promoting a more structural compliance...|$|R

One of the foundations of a set of Financial Accounting Standards is the creation of a Conceptual Framework that defines the principles upon which the standards will be based. Most major national and international accounting standards have developed conceptual frameworks to support their work on setting standards.|$|R

40|$|Assessing the {{potential}} impact of development projects in the Sudan dates back {{to the study of the}} Equatorial Nile Project conducted in the last century during the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies commenced in the early eighties of the last century with the establishment of the Institute of Environmental Studies in the University of Khartoum. The practice gathered momentum with the recent activities in the oil and roads sectors. Although the practice of (EIA) has only recently been legalized by the passing of the Environment Protection Act of 2001, the performance of EIA is often poor due to flaws in legislative, administrative, institutional and <b>procedural</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Effective implementation of the EIA process in the Sudan requires the institutionalization of the process within the legislative, administrative, political and education system in the country. Special emphasis is needed for the federal system of governance. Other issues include accreditation, sectoral regulations, establishing of a National Centre of EIA for advising the government and for training of human capacities. The paper calls for more involvement of stakeholders via effective popular participation in all steps of EIA. The expected influx of foreign investors following the Comprehensive Peace Accord of 2005 and the concentration of oil reserves in the ecologically rich and sensitive regions, call for an urgent improvement in the legislative, institutional and procedural aspects of the process.

40|$|The 1999 Helsinki {{decision}} of the European Council to grant Turkey candidate country status, the ‘Berlin plus’ arrangements on EU access to NATO assets, and the 2006 agreement on participation of Turkey in EU crisis management operations seem to have (temporarily) solved the dilemma for Brussels: now the EU can keep channels of communication with Turkey open, gain access to Turkish capabilities, and use effective tools to influence Ankara’s policies. But Turkey has stressed its discontent with its status within CSDP, primarily because {{it wants to be}} more fully associated with the EU’s decisions in areas where it has a strategic interest and could play a key role, for instance in the Middle East and the South Caucasus. In an effort also to pressure on Brussels to push Turkey’s pre-accession process forward, Ankara has, on a case-by-case basis, exercised its veto right over the use of NATO’s assets by EU crisis management operations. The further development of CSDP is thus, at least in part, linked to progress on Turkey’s path to EU accession. This working paper explores the peculiarities of the EU-Turkey power equation through the prism of the institutional and <b>procedural</b> <b>frameworks</b> in CSDP and offers ideas based on the Lisbon Treaty to forge a more strategic partnership between the EU and Turkey. nrpages: 27 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Decision {{support in}} urban {{regeneration}} planning involves fulfilment of complex design objectives {{that require a}} close collaboration between stakeholders, designers and planners. The objectives are to achieve computationally optimized design plans that are environmentally robust and sustainable. For the purpose of pre-planning analysis and optimization of such design models, the construction framework of the whole system development life cycle is simulated using specialist analysis tools. In the analysis and design phase of such a construction process, location allocation of built environment structures integrated with AI based urban assessment models remain a cumbersome task. With the advent of sophisticated computing hardware and 3 D modelling techniques, it has become viable to visualize and develop simulation outcomes with ease over standard computers. However, creation of simulated outcomes with huge urban details still remains a daunting task. With the advent of knowledge-based data standards and mining techniques, possibilities have arisen to integrate <b>procedural</b> urban modelling <b>frameworks</b> with socio-economic deprivation assessment systems to create massive city models {{in order to improve}} sustainability and smart growth. The implementation of a <b>procedural</b> modelling <b>framework</b> offers a promising area of research in location allocation optimization of residential and public service structures for urban regeneration planning and collaboration purposes but is still largely stochastic in nature until now...|$|R
