5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1457, a large Ottoman {{army was}} seen {{approaching}} Albania. Skanderbeg {{sent a letter to}} Calixtus informing him of the Ottoman arrival and the dire need for military aid. The pope responded with a promise to send a fleet to Albania – even though the enemy was on land – but it did not arrive. Skanderbeg was thus left to fight the oncoming Ottoman army alone. Mehmed II had placed Isak Bey Evrenoz and Hamza Kastrioti in command of the force. Isak bey was an experienced commander who had crushed John Kastrioti's rebellion in 1430 and led the Ottoman counterattack at the Siege of Berat. Hamza brought along with him several disaffected Albanian nobles and <b>personal</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the tactics they could expect from Skanderbeg. In total, Ottoman forces numbered between 50,000 and 80,000 men. Armies of this size were usually commanded by the sultan himself so rumors spread that Mehmed was leading the campaign. In contrast, Skanderbeg had between 8,000 and 10,000 men to stand in opposition.|$|E

40|$|Teachers’ <b>personal</b> {{practical}} <b>knowledge</b> is {{the knowledge}} of teachers which is principally known and produced by teachers themselves. Greatly inspired by Meijer, Verloop and Beijaard (1999), this study uses a questionnaire and an interview to continue the line of their investigation. The study aims to describe and illustrate the content of 13 teachers’ <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge</b> about teaching reading comprehension to non-English majors at a university in China. The study is also to examine similarities (shared knowledge) and differences in teacher knowledge, and potentially relevant background variables in it. As a result, detailed information about these teachers’ <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge</b> about teaching reading comprehension has been found. Meijer et al. (1999) could not find shared knowledge by investigating teachers from different schools. In this study, by investigating teachers from the same school, shared knowledge {{could not be found}} either. Thus, by comparing these teachers’ <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge,</b> they can be classified into three groups: subject-matter-oriented, student-oriented and student-learning-oriented teachers. Each group is illustrated by describing one teacher’s knowledge as a typical example. Moreover, six potentially relevant background variables are discussed in this study. By matching the six background variables to the responses of these teachers, three patterns in potentially relevant background variables have been developed: professional-growth teachers, student-centered teachers, and authority-maintaining teachers...|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her <b>personal</b> <b>knowledge</b> and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|England {{also had}} a {{tradition}} of drawing on expert foreign engineers for military engineering; Italians were particularly sought after, as their home country was felt to be generally more technically advanced, particularly {{in the field of}} fortifications. One of these foreign engineers, Stefan von Haschenperg from Moravia, worked on Camber, Pendennis, Sandgate and St Mawes, apparently attempting to reproduce Italian designs, although his lack of <b>personal</b> <b>knowledge</b> of such fortifications impacted poorly on the end results. Technical treatises from mainland Europe also influenced the designers of the Device Forts, including Albrecht Dürer's Befestigung der Stett, Schlosz und Felcken which described contemporary methods of fortification in Germany, published in 1527 and translated into Latin in 1535, and Niccolò Machiavelli's Libro dell'art della guerra, published in 1521, which also described new Italian forms of military defences.|$|E

A small observational study of two mathematically well-qualified teachers, teaching at a range of levels, leads to a deeper understanding of how their <b>personal</b> mathematical <b>knowledge</b> is manifested in their teaching. Finally, we present a theory of pedagogy combining dual development, intellectual necessity, and repeated experience of reasoning, for which these teachers' practices provide illustrations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports a}} study of the {{discourse}} of shared lesson planning sessions {{in the early stages of}} a pre-service TESOL certificate course. The study focuses on ‘lesson planning conferences’ (LPCs), in which a teacher educator and a group of student teachers worked on one student teacher’s lesson plan. It describes the discursive practices through which lesson plans emerged and through which student teachers constructed <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge</b> and identity as they negotiated the process of becoming members of the community of practice of English language teachers. The study revealed the LPCs to be a dynamic and recursive process in which problems of instruction emerged and solutions were suggested. While the teacher educators produced more meanings related to <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge,</b> the student teachers had a substantial share in the discursive resources with which meanings were exchanged. The analysis also shows how participants engaged with the practice of planning for teaching through such discursive acts as producing directives, proposing actions, evaluating, articulating teaching principles and imagining classroom events. The article argues that – in spite of some limitations – shared lesson planning is a promising strategy for the construction of novice language teachers’ <b>personal</b> practical <b>knowledge</b> and professional identities...|$|R

Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.|$|E

Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the Republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away.|$|E
