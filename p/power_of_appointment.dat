5|$|Foliot {{was elected}} to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant since the death of Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without {{guidance}} from the king, or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> to two churches. He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory. He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop. He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt with the problems of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

50|$|Among other responsibilities, the {{governor}} heads the Council of State. The Governor of North Carolina {{was the last}} state chief executive to receive veto power; the Governor did not have this power until 1996. The Governor of North Carolina has extensive <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> executive branch officials, some judges, and members of boards and commissions.

25|$|The Prime Minister {{makes all}} the most senior Crown appointments, and most others are made by Ministers over whom the PM has the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> and dismissal. Privy Counsellors, Ambassadors and High Commissioners, senior civil servants, senior {{military}} officers, members of important committees and commissions, and other officials are selected, {{and in most cases}} may be removed, by the Prime Minister. The PM also formally advises the Sovereign on the appointment of Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England, but the PM's discretion is limited by the existence of the Crown Nominations Commission. The appointment of senior judges, while constitutionally still on the advice of the Prime Minister, is now {{made on the basis of}} recommendations from independent bodies.|$|E
50|$|Most general <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> are exercisable under a will.

25|$|It was Mayor Westervelt's stated aim to {{sort out}} the bad seed. In 1853 an {{administrative}} body was created, called the Board of Police Commissioners, consisting of Mayor Westervelt, the recorder and the city judge.

25|$|The {{governor}} {{has the power}} to commission officers not otherwise commissioned by the law of Oklahoma and has the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> When any office at the state level becomes vacant for any reason, the governor, unless otherwise provided by law, {{has the power to}} appoint a person to fill such vacancy, who shall continue in office until the election or appointment of a successor. If the office of an Oklahoma member of the United States House of Representatives or United States Senate becomes vacant the governor calls a special election to fill the remainder of the term. In the case of United States senators, the governor is empowered by the U.S. Constitution to appoint someone immediately to fill the vacant Senate seat temporarily until a special election can be held.|$|E
25|$|Before Solon's reforms, the Athenian {{state was}} {{administered}} by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus {{on the basis}} of noble birth and wealth. The Areopagus comprised former archons and it therefore had, in addition to the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> extraordinary influence as a consultative body. The nine archons took the oath of office while ceremonially standing on a stone in the agora, declaring their readiness to dedicate a golden statue if they should ever be found to have violated the laws. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the primary <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, {{it is said that}} the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{held for}} <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> objects were {{sufficiently}} certain if any given individual {{could be said}} to be in, or not in, the class. (So this was more relaxed than list certainty, which requires everyone to be said to be in the class.) Lord Upjohn reaffirmed the list certainty test for discretionary trusts, but then in McPhail v Doulton, the list certainty test was abandoned for discretionary trusts as well.|$|R

After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will.

However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, local authorities, and the Charity Commissions) are legally {{more or less}} independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under Common Law or granted and limited by Act of Parliament, and are subject to European Union law and the competencies that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the Courts by judicial review.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} two claims {{made about the}} 'Commission crisis' of 1999 : first, that the accountability of the Commission to the European Parliament (EP) was significantly increased; and, second, that the model of parliamentary government in the European Union (EU) was advanced by events in 1999. In analyzing the crisis and its consequences, this article focuses upon the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> dismissal and <b>appointment,</b> and what these powers reveal about {{the capacity of the}} EP both to hold the Commission responsible for its collective and individual actions and to influence its policy agenda. If a parliamentary model is to develop in the EU, the negative parliamentary <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> censure and dismissal have to be balanced by the positive <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> and enhanced executive responsiveness. On both counts - dismissal and appointment - the 1999 'Commission crisis' did not point to the clear and unambiguous dawning of a 'genuine European parliamentary democracy. ...|$|R
2500|$|In each country, leading {{bodies of}} the ruling Communist Part {{exercised}} hierarchical control of the censorship system. Each Communist Party maintained a department of its Central Committee apparatus to supervise media. [...] Censors employed auxiliary tools such as: the power to launch or close down any newspaper, radio or television station, licensing of journalists through unions and the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> Party bureaucrats held all leading editorial positions.

This abated factionalism for the next four successions, each resulting in quick elections and imperial approval. However, Pope Severinus was forced to wait 20 months for imperial approval in 640, receiving it only months before his death. So Pope Martin I refused to wait, insisting on being consecrated only days after his election. This resulted in his abduction by Constans II to Constantinople in 653, where he was tried and sentenced to exile. The next seven popes were more agreeable to Constantinople, and approved without delay, but Pope Benedict II had to wait a year in 684. After that, the emperor delegated the approval to the Exarch of Ravenna, the Byzantine governor of central Italy, including the Duchy of Rome.|$|E

60|$|The {{practice}} of naming attachés to our legations leads to great abuses of this nature. In {{the first place}} the Constitution is violated; for, without a law of Congress to that effect (and I believe none exists), not even the President {{has a right to}} name one, without the approval of the Senate. In no case can a minister appoint one legally, for the Constitution gives him under no circumstances any such authority; and our system does not admit of the constructive authority that is used under other governments, unless it can be directly referred to an expressly delegated power. Now the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> to office is expressly delegated; but it is to another, or rather to another through Congress, should Congress choose to interfere. This difficulty is got over by saying an attaché is not an officer. If not an officer of the government, he is nothing. He is, at all events, deemed to be an officer of the government in foreign countries, and enjoys immunities as such. Besides, it is a dangerous precedent to name to any situation under a pretence like this, as the practice may become gradually enlarged. But I care nothing as to the legality of the common appointments of this nature, the question being as to the tone of the nominees. You may be assured that I shall send you no idle gossip; but there is more importance connected with these things than you may be disposed at first to imagine. Here, these young men are believed to represent the state of feeling at home, and are listened to with more respect than they would be as simple travellers. It would be far better not to appoint them at all; but, if this is an indulgence that it would be ungracious to withhold, they should at least be made to enter into engagements not to deride the institutions they are thought to represent; for, to say nothing of principle, such a course can only re-act, by discrediting the national character.|$|E

50|$|The {{common law}} has long {{recognised}} {{the concept of}} a receiver. Following the development of the floating charge creditors were effectively able to take security over a company's entire business by means of a floating charge over the undertaking. Security documents generally contained very wide <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> such that on default the creditor could take over the business immediately and without the input of any court. A receiver appointed to the entire business became known as a receiver and manager.
