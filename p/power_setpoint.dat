It {{is known that}} conventional PV inverter controllers, which are designed to extract maximum power at unity power factor, cannot address secondary performance objectives such as voltage regulation and network loss minimization. Optimal power flow techniques can be utilized to select which inverters will provide ancillary services, and to compute their optimal real and reactive <b>power</b> <b>setpoints.</b> Leveraging advances in semidefinite relaxation techniques and sparsity-promoting regularizations, such problems can be solved with reduced computational burden and with optimality guarantees. To enable large-scale implementation, a novel algorithmic framework is introduced - based on the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers - by which the optimal power flow problem in this setting can be systematically decomposed into sub-problems that can be solved in a decentralized fashion by the utility and customer-owned PV systems with limited exchanges of information. Since the computational burden is shared among multiple devices and the requirement of all-to-all communication can be circumvented, the proposed optimization approach scales to large distribution networks.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} daily volt/var control in distribution networks with feeder capacitors, substation capacitors and transformers equipped with on-load tap changers. A hybrid approach is proposed {{to solve the}} daily volt/var control problem. To reduce the computational requirements of the problem, this approach combines two methods, namely heuristic and optimal scheduling for the substation and feeder sub-problems respectively. The feeder capacitor dispatch schedule is determined based on a heuristic reactive <b>power</b> <b>setpoint</b> method. At this stage {{the objective is to}} minimize the reactive power flow through the substation bus in every time-interval. And as such, mathematical modeling of the distribution network components is adapted to suit time-varying conditions. Furthermore, an optimization model to determine a proper dispatch schedule of the substation devices is formulated. The objective of this model is to minimize the daily total energy loss and voltage deviations. Additionally, the reference voltage of the substation secondary bus and the transformer tap position limits are modified to adapt to given load profiles. The optimization model is solved with a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm, which incorporates Newton’s method to determine the power-flow solution. The proposed method is applied to a time-varying distribution system and evaluated under different operational scenarios. It is also compared to on-line volt/var control with various settings. Simulation results show that the proposed approach minimizes both the voltage deviations and the total energy loss, while on-line control prioritizes one objective over the other depending on the specified settings.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} method to perform a safe uninten-tional {{islanding}} maneuver of microgrids. The method is derived {{in the context of}} a framework for the real-time control of microgrids, called Commelec, recently proposed by the Authors. The framework uses a hierarchy of software agents that com-municate with each other using a common, device independent protocol in order to define explicit <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> without the need of droop controllers. We show that the features of the framework allow to design a generic control method for treating unintentional islanding with the following properties. First, the method is able to choose the best candidate slack resource, based on the information obtained from the agents. Second, as the agent responsible for the grid has a global view of the network’s status and its resources, it is possible to optimize the performance of the network during and after the islanding transition. Third, after the islanding maneuver it allows for the online switching of the slack resource to that with the best capabilities to face the network’s needs. Finally, the method is suitable for inertia-less systems as the control is performed using explicit <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> and it does not rely on the frequency signal. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed method via simulation on the LV microgrid benchmark defined by the CIGRE ́ Task Force C 6. 04. 02, by comparing its performance to that of the standard droop-based method called load drop anticipator.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a fast {{development}} and deployment of wind energy to meet the increasing electrical power demand and to limit the use of fossil fuels. More and more wind farms are planned far from shore because of good wind condition and less visual impact. This is so called offshore wind farm (OWF). In such a situation, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is a favorable option for integrating these OWFs to the onshore grid, because HVDC, compared with high voltage alternating current (HVAC), has lower losses and higher transmission efficiency. For HVDC transmission, voltage source converter (VSC) has some advantages over current source converter (CSC), e. g. independent control of active power and reactive power, bidirectional power transfer for fixed voltage polarity. When a fault occurs at the onshore ac grid which connects OWFs via VSC-HVDC, the active power cannot be fully transmitted to onshore grid, while OWFs still produce active power. The imbalanced power will increase the HVDC-link voltage. This increased dc voltage will lead to high electrical stress for the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules, capacitors as well as cables, and even damage them. There have been different proposed methods to deal with this problem, e. g. chopper controlled resistor, wind turbine generator <b>power</b> <b>setpoint</b> adjustment, wind turbine grid side converter active current reduction, offshore voltage reduction. Chopper resistor method limits dc-link voltage by dissipating the imbalanced power. The second and third method reduce the power output from each wind turbine to limit the dc-link voltage increase. These two methods need communication between HVDC converter and each wind turbine. Offshore voltage reduction method initiates a controlled voltage drop by offshore converter to achieve a fast power reduction. All these four fault ride through (FRT) methods will be implemented in a test system and the effectiveness of these methods are evaluated with simulations made in PSCAD environment. Finally, based on the proposed methods, an enhanced FRT method is developed and its effectiveness is tested with the system. The advantages and disadvantages of different FRT methods are compared and summarized. Electrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Renewable energy resources, such as {{photovoltaic}} panels, {{typically have}} very volatile power-injection character-istics, which poses {{a number of}} challenges to the real-time control of electrical grids that contain a significant fraction of these resources. Recently, a new paradigm for controlling such grids, termed COMMELEC, was proposed; it uses explicit <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> instead of droop-control. Central to this new paradigm is an abstract message format that enables resources to delegate the decisions related to their control actions to a grid controller. This {{is essential to the}} feasibility of the approach, as it makes the grid controller device-independent. However, it leaves to the resource agents the burden of translating device-specific information into this abstract format. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem; more specifically, we present a very simple Application Programming Interface (API) {{that can be used to}} design a COMMELEC-compliant resource agent. We present an easy-to-use High-Level API, which supports a pre-defined set of resources, such as a battery or a photovoltaic panel. We also describe a Low-Level API that provides full access to the underlying message format, and allows to design a resource agent that is not supported by the High-Level API.

In inverter-based microgrids, the paralleled inverters need to work in grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode and to transfer seamlessly between the two modes. In grid-connected mode, the inverters control the amount of power injected into the grid. In stand-alone mode, however, the inverters control the island voltage while the output power is dictated by the load. This can be achieved using the droop control. Inverters can have different power set-points during grid-connected mode but in stand-alone mode they all need their power set-points to be adjusted according to their power ratings. However, during sudden unintentional islanding (due to loss of mains), transient power can flow from inverters with high <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> to inverters with low power set-points, which can raise the DC link voltage of the inverters causing them to shut down. This paper investigates the transient circulating power between paralleled inverters during unintentional islanding and proposes a controller to limit it.

40|$|We {{target the}} problem of {{controlling}} electrical microgrids with little inertia in real time. We consider a central controller {{and a number of}} resources, where each resource is either a load, a generator, or a combination thereof, like a battery. The controller periodically computes <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> for the resources based on the estimated state of the grid and an overall objective, and subject to safety constraints. Each resource is augmented with a resource agent that a) implements the setpoint requests sent by the controller on the resource, and b) translates device-specific information about the resource into a device-independent representation and transmits this to the controller. We focus on the resource agents and their impact on the overall system's behavior. Intuitively, for the system to converge to the objective, the resource agents should be obedient to the requests from the controller, {{in the sense that the}} actually implemented setpoint should be close to the requested setpoint, at least on average. This can be important especially when a controller that performs continuous optimization is used (for the sake of performance) to control discrete resources (which have a discrete set of implementable setpoints). We formalize obedience by defining the notion of $c$-bounded accumulated-error. We then demonstrate its usefulness, by presenting theoretical results (for a simple scenario) and simulation results (for a more realistic setting) that indicate that, if all resource agents in the system have bounded accumulated-error, the closed-loop system converges on average to the objective. Finally, we show how to design resource agents that provably have bounded accumulated-error for various types of resources, such as resources with uncertainty (e. g., PV panels) and resources with a discrete set of implementable setpoints (e. g., on-off heating systems).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly focused on (i) {{modeling}} of dc distribution systems for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), (ii) proposing {{a method to}} enhance {{the stability of the}} dc distribution systems, and (iii) proposing an energy management strategy to control the power flow in the dc distribution system. The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid. In the first part, a systematic method for developing a model for a dc distribution system, based on the configuration of the system is proposed. The developed model is of the matrix form and, therefore, can readily be expanded to represent a dc distribution system of any desired number of dc-dc converters. The model captures both the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the system, and includes the port capacitors of the converters, as well as the interconnection cables. Thus, it can be used for identifying the condition for the existence of a steady state, as well as for stability analysis. In the second part, the thesis proposes a method for enhancing the stability of the dc distribution system. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the <b>power</b> <b>setpoints</b> of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this master thesis is to design a power plant controller for a photo- voltaic (PV) power plant. In a first stage, the current situation {{of the status of}} the electrical grid is analysed. The electrical network structure is moving from a conventional system (with centralized power generation, unidirectional power ows, easy control) to a smart grid system consisting on distributed generation, renewable energies, smart and complex control architecture and al- gorithms, bidirectional power ow, etc. Some of the issues regarding the integration of renewable power plants are identified. The increase of renewable penetration into the electrical system can produce instabilities in terms of voltage and frequency. So that, the operation of these power plants must have grid support functionalities. To design a power plant controller for providing PV plants with the capacity to give the required grid support, it is necessary to use a model of a PV power plant. So that, the modelling of the PV power plant is presented. This model contemplates the PV cell, the PV array, the power electronics (PV inverter) and the associated control, the grid layout as well as ancillary devices as FACTS, capacitor banks or energy storage. Once the power plant is modelled, a central controller is designed to coordinate all the PV plant devices in order to deliver the desired active and reactive power to the grid. The controller is capable to perform the following functions: active and reactive <b>power</b> <b>setpoints,</b> voltage and frequency droops, power factor control and ramp rate limitations. These actions are the required by most of the grid codes. The power plant controller is validated with the support of simulations. After that, it has been identified the active power ramp rate problem when the plant is not equipped with auxiliary generation: when the available active power decreases suddenly (for example due to the clouds passing over the PV plant), the ramp rate limitations of active power cannot be respected. So, the installation of an energy storage system has been studied. Considering the PV plant with energy storage system, two control strategies for limiting the active power ramp rate are analysed. After that, possible effects that communication delays can produce are studied and a little modification the controller is proposed in order to improve the PV plant operation...|$|R

40|$|Ogunnaike, Babatunde A. Because using {{non-renewable energy}} systems (e. g., coal-powered {{cogeneration}} power plants) {{to generate electricity}} is an unsustainable, environmentally hazardous practice, {{it is important to}} develop cost-effective and reliable renewable energy systems, such as photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs), and fuel cells (FCs). Non-renewable energy systems, however, are currently less expensive than individual renewable energy systems (IRESs). Furthermore, IRESs based on intermittent natural resources (e. g., solar irradiance and wind) are incapable of meeting continuous energy demands. Such shortcomings can be mitigated by judiciously combining two or more complementary IRESs to form a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). Although previous research efforts focused on the design, operation, and control of HRESs has proven useful, no prior HRES research endeavor has taken a systematic and comprehensive approach towards establishing guidelines by which HRESs should be designed, operated, and controlled. The overall goal of this dissertation, therefore, is to establish the principles governing the design, operation, and control of HRESs resulting in cost-effective and reliable energy solutions for stationary and mobile applications. The first empirical part of this dissertation focuses on HRES equipment selection and sizing using an economic and feasibility analysis. We determined that HRES components and their sizes should be rationally selected using knowledge of component costs, availability of renewable energy resources, and expected power demands of the application. To demonstrate this statement, we ascertained the economically preferred and feasible renewable energy system types and sizes for a range of average annual wind speed, average annual solar irradiance, power demand and minimum renewable fraction. We found that under some combinations of these variables HRESs are less expensive than IRESs and grid-supplied energy. This result has a significant implication for renewable energy systems becoming increasingly ubiquitous. After HRES type and sizes are selected, it is necessary to determined how the components are arranged and what control systems are best for coordinating the entire system to meet a set of operating objectives (typically satisfy a power demand while storing excess power for later use). This was demonstrated by way of a case study involving the design, control, and economics of a University of Delaware FC/battery bus retrofitted with a roof-installed PV array. The preferred arrangement of HRES components is the FC in series with the battery (the FC is committed to maintaining a desired battery state of charge (SOC) while the battery meets the majority of the bus power demand) while the PV array is used to assist the battery in meeting the bus power demand, with excess PV power being used to charge the battery. Simulation results indicate that under a variety of operating conditions, a PID control strategy is best for enabling the bus to satisfy required power demands and maintain a desired battery SOC. An economic analysis of the PV investment necessary to realize the HRES design objectives indicates that the investment will pay for itself in Newark, DE, establishing the economic viability of the proposed addition of a PV array to the existing University of Delaware FC/battery bus. Although the performance of standard controllers for HRESs is generally satisfactory, operating objectives can be met more reliably and efficiently when information-rich data is used to coordinate HRES component. Two such data-driven control paradigms were developed in separate case studies. In the first case study, we developed and evaluated a method for reconfiguration of control loops in decentralized control schemes using directed spectral decomposition of collected process data. This technique was applied to a stirred mixing tank process and was shown to improve control performance under changing operating conditions. The second case study, which involved data-driven centralized control, establishes a method for adaptive data-driven MPC of a PV/WT/FC/battery/electrolyzer HRES for a single-family home using measured disturbance prediction and model adaptation. This procedure was shown to enable the HRES to better track a <b>power</b> demand <b>setpoint,</b> resulting in increased system reliability and efficiency. Finally, a PV/WT/battery HRES called an OMNi-Charger, which is intended for small-scale (~ 1 W) remote power applications) was experimentally validated under varying power demand, wind speed, and solar irradiance during controlled and field tests. The OMNi-Charger controller—a simple state controller that enacts a prespecified control action depending on the current state or operating conditions of the system—was shown to enable the OMNi-Charger to meet varying power demands nearly instantaneously and consistently despite rapid and unknown fluctuations in wind speed and solar irradiance. Although the OMNi-Charger warrants some future investigation, the device should prove useful as a cell phone charging station or a power source for lighted ocean buoys.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} modelling-based design, {{operation}} {{and control of}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) hybrid systems. Fuel cells are a promising approach to high-efficiency power generation, as they directly convert chemical energy to electric work. High-temperature fuel cells such as the SOFC can be integrated in gas turbine processes, which further increases the electrical efficiency to values up to 70 %. However, {{there are a number}} of obstacles for safe operation of such a system, such as fuel cell damage through thermal loads or undesired chemical reactions, or gas turbine problems related to high thermal capacity and volume of the pressurised components. Development of suitable plant design as well as operation and control strategies is hence a key task for realisation of the mentioned systems. The first part of the thesis describes the utilised models. All component models that have been developed and applied for the work are mathematically defined based on a fixed pattern. The thermodynamically most relevant components are tubular SOFC, indirect internal reformer and heat exchangers, and spatially discretised models are used for these. For the turbomachinery, map-based steady-state behaviour is modelled. Gas residence times and pressure drops are accounted for in all components they are relevant. Based on the component models, three different hybrid cycles are examined. In the first cycle, the SOFC replaces the combustion chamber of a recuperated single-shaft turbine. The SOFC is pressurised and the cycle is called “directly integrated SOFC cycle” (DIC). Further cycle options are a DIC with a two-shaft gas turbine (DIC- 2 T) and an indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC). In the latter, the compressed gas is heated recuperatively with the exhaust gas and the SOFC is operated at ambient pressure by connecting its air inlet to the turbine exhaust. All cycles incorporate the SOFC system design proposed by Siemens-Westinghouse, including indirect internal reforming, a tubular SOFC bundle and anode recirculation by an ejector. The first cycle (DIC) is regarded as standard cycle. Objectives for highly efficient, safe system design are formulated and design parameters are associated. A design calculation determines the design parameters for the standard cycle, based on a nominal power output of 220 kW. The design LHVbased electric efficiency is app. 63 %. Related to the design point, steady-state part-load ability of the system is analysed and displayed in two-dimensional performance maps where each axis represents one degree of freedom. Degrees of freedom considered are fuel and air flow; fuel utilisation is assumed constant. A result is that a strategy with constant mean fuel cell temperature is most advantageous in terms of safe and gentle operation. Further advantages of this strategy are the ability for low part-load and high efficiency at part-load operation. A control strategy is derived for dynamical implementation of the found part-load strategy. The system power output is primarily controlled by the SOFC power. The fuel utilisation is kept within certain bounds and the fuel flow is manipulated to control it to its design value. The fuel cell temperature is controlled by the air flow, which again is controlled by manipulating the GT shaft speed through the generator power. To determine the required air flow, a mixed feedforward and feedback strategy is used, where the feedforward part calculates a prediction based on the net power output and the feedback part provides correction based on the measurement of the SOFC fuel outlet temperature. Additional constraints to the control system are the supervision of the shaft speed and the valid operation regime of the anode recirculation ejector. The proposed control strategy provides robust control. The mean SOFC temperature, however, shows large transient deviation upon large load steps. The time to reach the <b>setpoint</b> <b>power</b> for large load steps is up to 70 s, while small load steps are followed in typically 1 - 2 s. A conclusion is that the system is suitable for load following operation as long as small load steps occur, as for example in distributed power generation for residential applications. Shutdown and startup strategies are introduced where the gas turbine provides air for cooling/heating throughout the procedures. Additional equipment and piping such as an auxiliary burner, a turbine exhaust throttle, a bypass around the recuperative heat exchanger as well as nitrogen and hydrogen supply and mixing units are required. Therewith, smooth cooling/heating of the cell can be accomplished without external electric power, but with a considerable amount of fuel and flushing nitrogen required. A further analysis investigates fuel flexibility of a system designed for methane: Hydrogen can be utilised without larger system modifications; only the control system characteristics must be adapted. Because no endothermic steam reforming takes place, the power output is, however, reduced to 70 % of the original value, and efficiency is reduced to 55 %. Applying the additional equipment required for shutdown/startup, the power can be increased to 94 % of the original value, although at a further efficiency decrease. In order to use ethanol as fuel in the ejector-driven anode, a recuperative vaporiser must be applied in the fuel channel. Supposed that reliable reforming catalysts for ethanol can be provided, 88 % of the original power output can be achieved at a high efficiency of 62 %. The investigation of the other cycle options reveals that a two turbine cycle where the power turbine is rotating at constant speed, mostly differs in terms of controllability. For controlling the air flow, another handle such as variable inlet guide vanes or air bypass around the SOFC system is required. The indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC) has a significantly lower efficiency of only 56 %, assuming the SOFC at the same temperature level than in the DIC.
