To make sure that the pollen was good, I took in this case, and in most of the other cases, pollen either from the same anther or from the same flower, and proved it to be good by placing it on the stigma of a short-styled plant, and found numerous pollen-tubes emitted.|$|E
60|$|As each unit, {{or group}} of similar units, {{throughout}} the body, casts off its gemmules, and as all are contained within the smallest ovule, and within each spermatozoon or <b>pollen-grain,</b> and as some animals and plants produce an astonishing number of pollen-grains and ovules (27/48. Mr. F. Buckland found 6,867,840 eggs in a cod-fish ('Land and Water' 1868 page 62). An Ascaris produces about 64,000,000 eggs (Carpenter's 'Comp. Phys.' 1854 page 590). Mr. J. Scott, of the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, calculated, {{in the same manner}} as I have done for some British Orchids ('Fertilisation of Orchids' page 344), the number of seeds in a capsule of an Acropera and found the number to be 371,250. Now this plant produces several flowers on a raceme, and many racemes during a season. In an allied genus, Gongora, Mr. Scott has seen twenty capsules produced on a single raceme; ten such racemes on the Acropera would yield above seventy-four millions of seed.), the number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something inconceivable. But considering how minute the molecules are, and how many go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary substance, this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not insuperable. From the data arrived at by Sir W. Thomson, my son George finds that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch of glass or water must consist of between 16 million millions, and 131 thousand million million molecules. No doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are larger, from being more complex, than those of an inorganic substance, and probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule; but when we bear in mind that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch is much smaller than any <b>pollen-grain,</b> ovule or bud, we can see what a vast number of gemmules one of these bodies might contain.|$|E
6000|$|... [From an {{examination}} of dried flowers of Amsinckia spectabilis, sent me by Professor Asa Gray, I formerly thought that this plant, {{a member of the}} Boragineae, was heterostyled. The pistil varies to an extraordinary degree in length, being in some specimens twice as long as in others, and the point of insertion of the stamens likewise varies. But on raising many plants from seed, I soon became convinced that the whole case was one of mere variability. The first-formed flowers are apt to have stamens somewhat arrested in development, with very little pollen in their anthers; and in such flowers the stigma projects above the anthers, whilst generally it stands below and sometimes on a level with them. I could detect no difference {{in the size of the}} <b>pollen-grain</b> or in the structure of the stigma in the plants which differed most in the above respects; and all of them, when protected from the access of insects, yielded plenty of seeds. Again, from statements made by Vaucher, and from a hasty inspection, I thought at first that the allied Anchusa arvensis and Echium vulgare were heterostyled, but soon saw my error. From information given me, I examined dried flowers of another member of the Boragineae, Arnebia hispidissima, collected from several sites, and though the corolla, together with the included organs, differed much in length, there was no sign of heterostylism.] ...|$|E

As shown in Table 1, the number of germinal apertures is 3 in each of <b>pollen-grains</b> in the diploid forms, mainly 3 and in part 4 in tetraploid ones, and predominantly 4 and in a far small proportion 3 or 5 in hexaploid ones. 2. Frequency occurrence of the anomalous <b>pollen-grains</b> with supernumerary apertures in some polyploid forms showed certain variation among different anthers within the same flower (Table 2). 3. It was safely asserted, irrespective of the foregoing irregularities, that the germinal apertures in <b>pollen-grains</b> of certain polyploidy forms tend to increase in their number in accordance with the degree of polyploidy of those forms concerned; and, moreover, the occurrence of 4 -apertured <b>pollen-grains</b> becomes to be much frequent in the autotetraploid forms as compared with the allotetraploid ones. The latter fact is very interesting to show that there exist certain definite difference between the polyploid forms of different nature of ploidy. 4. The frequent occurrence of <b>pollen-grains</b> with the supernumerary germinal apertures in the polyploid plant may be ascribable to certain irregularities of meiotic divisions and of the subsequent processes in microsporogenesis, but the causal mechanism remains unidentified...|$|R

60|$|In a highly-organised animal, the gemmules {{thrown off}} from each {{different}} unit {{throughout the body}} must be inconceivably numerous and minute. Each unit of each part, as it changes during development, {{and we know that}} some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses, must throw off its gemmules. But the same cells may long continue to increase by self-division, and even become modified by absorbing peculiar nutriment, without necessarily throwing off modified gemmules. All organic beings, moreover, include many dormant gemmules derived from their grandparents and more remote progenitors, but not from all their progenitors. These almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules are contained within each bud, ovule, spermatozoon, and <b>pollen-grain.</b> Such an admission will be declared impossible; but number and size are only relative difficulties. Independent organisms exist which are barely visible under the highest powers of the microscope, and their germs must be excessively minute. Particles of infectious matter, so small as to be wafted by the wind or to adhere to smooth paper, will multiply so rapidly as to infect within a short time the whole body of a large animal. We should also reflect on the admitted number and minuteness of the molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter. The difficulty, therefore, which at first appears insurmountable, of believing in the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they must be according to our hypothesis, has no great weight.|$|E
60|$|Fritz Muller {{observed}} the poisonous {{action of the}} plant's own pollen in the above-mentioned Oncidium flexuosum, O. unicorne, pubes (?), and in two other unnamed species. Also in two species of Rodriguezia, in two of Notylia, in one of Burlingtonia, and of a fourth genus in the same group. In all these cases, except the last, it was proved that the flowers were, as might have been expected, fertile with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species. Numerous flowers of one species of Notylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme; in two days' time they all withered, the germens began to shrink, the pollen-masses became dark brown, and not one <b>pollen-grain</b> emitted a tube. So that in this orchid the injurious action of the plant's own pollen is more rapid than with Oncidium flexuosum. Eight other flowers on the same raceme were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species: two of these were dissected, and their stigmas {{were found to be}} penetrated by numberless pollen-tubes; and the germens of the other six flowers became well developed. On a subsequent occasion many other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen, and all fell off dead in a few days; whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh. We have seen that in cross-unions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen long remains undecayed; but Notylia behaved in this respect differently; for when its pollen was placed on the stigma of Oncidium flexuosum, both the stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown, {{in the same manner as}} if the plant's own pollen had been applied.|$|E
60|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is quite a}} distinct matter. Here, in all these cases, what is required is the detachment of two portions of the parental organisms, which portions we know as the egg and the spermatozoon. In plants it is the ovule and the <b>pollen-grain,</b> as in the flowering plants, or the ovule and the antherozooid, as in the flowerless. Among all forms of animal life, the spermatozoa proceed from the male sex, and the egg {{is the product of}} the female. Now, what is remarkable about this mode of {{reproduction is}} this, that the egg by itself, or the spermatozoa by themselves, are unable to assume the parental form; but if they be brought into contact with one another, the effect of the mixture of organic substances proceeding from two sources appears to confer an altogether new vigour to the mixed product. This process is brought about, as we all know, by the sexual intercourse of the two sexes, and is called the act of impregnation. The result of this act {{on the part of the}} male and female is, that the formation of a new being is set up in the ovule or egg; this ovule or egg soon begins to be divided and subdivided, and to be fashioned into various complex organisms, and eventually to develop into the form of one of its parents, as I explained in the first lecture. These are the processes by which the perpetuation of organic beings is secured. Why there should be the two modes--why this re-invigoration should be required on the part of the female element we do not know; but it is most assuredly the fact, and it is presumable, that, however long the process of asexual multiplication could be continued, I say there is good reason to believe that it would come to an end if a new commencement were not obtained by a conjunction of the two sexual elements.|$|E

60|$|This form {{can be at}} once {{recognised}} by {{the length}} of the pistil, which is (including the ovarium) fully one-third longer than that of the mid-styled, and more than thrice as long as that of the short-styled form. It is so disproportionately long, that it projects in the bud through the folded petals. It stands out considerably beyond the mid-length stamens; its terminal portion depends a little, but the stigma itself is slightly upturned. The globular stigma is considerably larger than that of the other two forms, with the papillae on its surface generally longer. The six mid-length stamens project about two-thirds {{the length of the}} pistil, and correspond in length with the pistil of the mid-styled form. Such correspondence in this and the two following forms is generally very close; the difference, where there is any, being usually in a slight excess of length in the stamens. The six shortest stamens lie concealed within the calyx; their ends are turned up, and they are graduated in length, so as to form a double row. The anthers of these stamens are smaller than those of the mid-length ones. The pollen is of the same yellow colour in both sets. H. Muller measured the <b>pollen-grain</b> in all three forms, and his measurements are evidently more trustworthy than those which I formerly made, so I will give them. (4/2. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' 1873 page 193.) The numbers refer to divisions of the micrometer equalling 1/300 millimetres. The grains, distended with water, from the mid-length stamens are 7 to 7 1/2, and those from the shortest stamens 6 to 6 1/2 in diameter, or as 100 to 86. The capsules of this form contain on an average 93 seeds: how this average was obtained will presently be explained. As these seeds, when cleaned, seemed larger than those from the mid-styled or short-styled forms, 100 of them were placed in a good balance, and by the double method of weighing were found to equal 121 seeds of the mid-styled or 142 of the short-styled; so that five long-styled seeds very nearly equal six mid-styled or seven short-styled seeds.|$|E
60|$|Primula elatior, Jacq., or the Bardfield Oxlip, {{is found}} in England only {{in two or three}} of the eastern counties. On the Continent it has a {{somewhat}} different range from that of the cowslip and primrose; and it inhabits some districts where neither of these species live. (2/14. For England, see Hewett C. Watson 'Cybele Britannica' volume 2 1849 page 292. For the Continent, see Lecoq 'Geograph. Botanique de l'Europe' tome 8 1858 page 142. For the Alps see 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 9 1842 pages 156 and 515.) In general appearance it differs so much from the common oxlip, that no one accustomed to see both forms in the living state could afterwards confound them; but there is scarcely more than a single character by which they can be distinctly defined, namely, their linear-oblong capsules equalling the calyx in length. (2/15. Babington 'Manual of British Botany' 1851 page 258.) The capsules when mature differ conspicuously, owing to their length, from those of the cowslip and primrose. With respect to the fertility of the two forms when these are united in the four possible methods, they behave like the other heterostyled species of the genus, but differ somewhat (see Tables 1.8 and 1.12.) in the smaller proportion of the illegitimately fertilised flowers which set capsules. That P. elatior is not a hybrid is certain, for when the two forms were legitimately united they yielded the large average of 47.1 seeds, and when illegitimately united 35.5 per capsule; whereas, of the four possible unions (Table 2.14) between the two forms of the common oxlip which we know to be a hybrid, one alone yielded any seed; and in this case the average number was only 11.6 per capsule. Moreover I could not detect a single bad <b>pollen-grain</b> in the anthers of the short-styled P. elatior; whilst in two short-styled plants of the common oxlip all the grains were bad, as were a large majority in a third plant. As the common oxlip is a hybrid between the primrose and cowslip, {{it is not surprising that}} eight long-styled flowers of the primrose, fertilised by pollen from the long-styled common oxlip, produced eight capsules (Table 1.18), containing, however, only a low average of seeds; whilst the same number of flowers of the primrose, similarly fertilised by the long-styled Bardfield oxlip, produced only a single capsule; this latter plant being an altogether distinct species from the primrose. Plants of P. elatior have been propagated by seed in a garden for twenty-five years, and have kept all this time quite constant, excepting that in some cases the flowers varied a little in size and tint. (2/16. See Mr. H. Doubleday in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 435, also Mr. W. Marshall ibid. page 462.) Nevertheless, according to Mr. H.C. Watson and Dr. Bromfield (2/17. 'Phytologist' volume 1 page 1001 and volume 3 page 695.), plants may be occasionally found in a state of nature, in which most of the characters by which this species can be distinguished from P. veris and vulgaris fail; but such intermediate forms are probably due to hybridisation; for Kerner states, in the paper before referred to, that hybrids sometimes, though rarely, arise in the Alps between P. elatior and veris.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn most {{flowering}} plants, {{a single}} cytokinesis follows the two meiotic divisions during <b>pollen-grain</b> ontogeny. Aperture pattern (i. e., aperture number and distribution on pollen surface) ontogeny could {{be linked to}} the processes ensuring the apportionment of the cytoplasm to the four microspores. This apportionment is achieved by radial arrays of microtubules organized around the nuclei. The cleavage planes are defined in the overlapping regions of opposing arrays extending from different nuclei. We followed the establishment of these arrays in two different lines of plants belonging to the genus Nicotiana that produce pollen grains with different aperture numbers. Different distributions of the microtubules have been observed, which can be interpreted as resulting from variation in the interactions between nuclei; these distributions appear to be correlated with aperture number. As a consequence, we propose that simultaneous cytokinesis allows the formation of multiple pollen morphologies. This mechanism is consistent with aperture number distribution within angiosperms and provides clues to help our understanding of the evolution of aperture number...|$|E

Four mechanisms were found: parallelspindles (ps), fused spindles (fs), premature cytokinesis- 1 (pc- 1) and premature cytokinesis- 2 (pc- 2).

40|$|The {{final stages}} of Helleborus <b>pollen-grain</b> ontogeny, which culminate in {{maturation}} and germination of the grain, have been investigated at the ultrastructural level.

The formation of the vacuole results in the displacement of the nucleus {{to one side of the}} pollen grain. The vacuole quickly disappears and a number of organelles reappear in the cytoplasm, in particular the dictyosomes and strands of endoplasmic reticulum, with associated grey bodies. Following mitotic division of the pollen grain, the first signs of the generative cell wall appear as a pair of tightly appressed unit membranes in the narrow strand of cytoplasm separating the two newly formed generative and vegetative nuclei. As development proceeds, the space between the two membranes gradually fills with an electron-transparent material similar to the substance found in the numerous dictyosome-derived vesicles which, together with the endoplasmic reticulum, are both closely associated with the developing cell wall.

Homozygous recessive (jpjp) plants are characterized by the complete failure of post-meiotic cytokinesis during microsporogenesis resulting in 100 % 4 n-pollen formation. Three F 1 segregating populations were produced and analyzed for <b>pollen-grain</b> production and the segregation of RFLP markers. The first cross combination did not segregate for the jumbo-pollen trait, but showed a clear segregation for multinucleate (bi-, tri- and tetra-nucleate) -microspore formation. Cytological analysis showed that few plants produced 100 % normal (uninucleate) microspores, whereas most of them produced multinucleate microspores at a variable frequency (0 â€“ 75 %). Plants with multinucleate microspores always showed a prevalence of binucleated microspores, even though some plants showed a background presence of tri- and tetra-nucleate microspores. QTL analysis based on ANOVA I and Step-wise Multiple Regression identified three QTLs with a highly significant effect on multinucleate-microspore formation. Two cross combinations, subsequently executed, showed Mendelian segregation for the jumbo-pollen trait and were effective in locating the jp gene on linkage group 6 close to the Vg 1 G 1 b RFLP locus. Interestingly, this RFLP locus was also linked to one QTL for multinucleate-microspore formation.

40|$|During the {{microspore}} {{division in}} Datura innoxia, the mitotic spindle is oriented in planes both perpendicular (PE) and oblique (OB) to the spore wall {{against which the}} nucleus is situated. However, irrespective of polarity, the usual type of hemispherical wall is laid down at cytokinesis and isolates the generative cell {{from the rest of}} the pollen grain (type A). In PE spores the vegetative nucleus initially occupies a central position in the pollen grain, whereas in OB spores the vegetative nucleus lies at the periphery of the grain close to the generative cell. In anther cultures initiated just before the microspore division is due to take place, no marked change can be observed in either orientation or symmetry of the mitotic spindle when the spores divide. In some, however, cytokinesis is disrupted and deposition of the hemispherical wall arrested. In the absence of a complete wall, differentiation of the generative cell cannot take place and binucleate pollen grains are formed having 2 vegetative-type nuclei (type B). The 2 nuclei in the B pollens are always situated against the <b>pollen-grain</b> wall, suggesting that the disruption phenomenon is related to the OB spores. The incomplete wall always makes contact with the intine on the intine-side of the spindle. Wall material may be represented merely as short stubs projecting out from the intine into the cytoplasm, in which event the 2 nuclei lie close to each other and are separated by only a narrow zone of cytoplasm. In other grains the wall is partially developed between the nuclei and terminates at varying distances from the tonoplast; in these, the nuclei are separated by a wider zone of cytoplasm. The significance of these binucleate grains in pollen embryogenesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|THE {{origin of}} species is {{the origin of the}} {{difference}} between two species. The existence of a peculiar difference between good species, which does not exist between varieties, has long been realised by systematists and others. This essential difference expresses itself, in part, in flowering plants, in the abortion of pollen and ovules in the hybrids, which springs, in typical cases: (a) from a different distribution of genes between two or more chromosome pairs; so that vital genes are omitted after the reduction division in {{some or all of the}} groups of chromosomes of the F 1 of the cross. An example of this is probably afforded by the crosses of certain species of Stizolobium (Mucuna) (Zeitsch. f. ind. Abst. u. Vererb., pp. 303 - 342, 1914), two non-homologous chromosomes appearing to have interchanged genes in one of the species. In the second case (b) the attraction between chromosomes which should be homologous fails in the reduction divisions of the F 1 plant, so that non-conjunction (Journal of Genetics, 1925) takes place with regard to one or more pairs. Thus there is an absence of vital chromosomes or the presence of extra chromosomes in some of the pollen and ovules. This is illustrated by the two cannas ``Austria'' and ``Italia'', which belong no doubt, as their history states, to the F 1 of species crosses. In `` Austria'', for example, the 18 single chromosomes show only 1 - 3 pairs at the reduction divisions. All the other chromosomes segregate at random, so that no more than one <b>pollen-grain</b> or embryo-sac out of thousands contains only the 9 chromosomes from one parent, and survives. In the cross of radish and cabbage, as Karpechenko (Journal of Genetics, vol. 14, pp. 375 - 396, 1924) has lately shown, chromosome conjugation is absent. This has also been shown in certain Digitalis crosses...|$|E
