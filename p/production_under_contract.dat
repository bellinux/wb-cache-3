40|$|Marketing and {{production}} contracts are a widely used risk mitigating {{strategy in the}} agricultural industry. Marketing contracts guarantee a market and focuses on the product at time of delivery. The producer owns the crop until time of delivery and is paid a premium based on quality and quantity predetermined in the contract. Production contracts create long term relationships between the producer and contractor. The producer will provide predetermined services to grow the crop. The contractor will provide inputs for the producer, giving the contractor some control over the production process and ownership of the crop.

40|$|The {{increase}} in vertical integration in agriculture has been motivated by many factors including the evolving demand of consumers {{as well as}} factors specific to agricultural markets (i. e. production and price uncertainty and farm policy). The literature on agricultural contracts has focused more on contracting in the livestock sector relative to crop <b>production</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract,</b> most likely {{due to the fact}} that contracting in livestock production has been historically more prevalent. However, crop <b>production</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> has also realized extensive growth, especially in the markets for crops with specialty traits. This paper provides a theoretical model of a contracting relationship between a risk-neutral monopsonistic processor of a specialty crop and risk-neutral producers. The processor induces farmers to accept production contracts, based on acreage or total bushels, to grow the specialty crop by offering a premium above the commodity price for contracted production. It is commonly assumed in the literature that acreage contracts will be the preferred structure due to producers being relatively more risk average than processors. However, this paper presents a market environment in which the opposite result is found. It is shown that a bushel contract exists which Pareto dominates the optimal acreage contract, although that bushel contract may not be the processors optimal bushel contract, and that both the processor and producers will be able to achieve higher expected profits by using a bushel contract structure. While explicit analytic solutions for the model do not exist, a numerical example is provided to illustrate effects of farm level yield volatility and the spatial correlation of farm yields on expected profits, premium levels, and farmer participation for the acreage and bushel contract equilibriums.

40|$|Production and {{marketing}} contracts govern 36 {{percent of the}} value of U. S. agricultural production, up from 12 percent in 1969. Contracts are now the primary method of handling sales of many livestock commodities, including milk, hogs, and broilers, and of major crops such as sugar beets, fruit, and processing tomatoes. Use of contracts is closely related to farm size; farms with $ 1 million or more in sales have nearly half their <b>production</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract.</b> For producers, contracting can reduce income risks of price and production variability, ensure market access, and provide higher returns for differentiated farm products. For processors and other buyers, vertical coordination through contracting is a way to ensure the flow of products and to obtain differentiated products, ensure traceability for health concerns, and guarantee certain methods of production. The traditional spot market-though it still governs nearly 60 percent {{of the value of}} agricultural production has difficulty providing accurate price signals for products geared to new consumer demands (such as produce raised and certified as organic or identity-preserved crops modified for special attributes). We are likely to see a continuing shift to more explicit forms of vertical coordination, through contracts and processor ownership, as a means to ensure more consistent product quantity and quality.

Have you asked an Internet utility to provide a travel route and found the result unintuitive? In each case, flaws in the road network representation may be to blame. Road switchbacks can result from digitization errors such as kinks and kickbacks. Route planning can be defeated by breaks in the network. Much of the digital map data used to represent the physical environment comes from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

40|$|The cost {{of potato}} {{cultivation}} {{has been found}} 17 to 24 per cent higher under contract farming over various costs than under non-contract system, mainly due to high investments on seeds, fertilizers and machine power. Yield has been found 255. 78 quintals per ha in the contract farms, which is 8. 84 per cent higher over the potato yield obtained from the non-contract farms. Gross income has been Rs 99753 per ha in the contract farms as against Rs 41572 per ha in non-contract system. The sale price of potato has been found much higher (Rs 390 /q) for contract than non-contract farms (Rs 177 /q). The net return over operational cost (cost ‘A 1 ’) has been found as Rs 11882 per ha in non-contract farms, which increased more than five-times under contract farming system, it being Rs 62982 per ha. Similarly, the net return has been found five-and-a-half times more in contract than non-contract system over cost C 1 (without rental value of the land). The net return over cost C 2 has been observed as Rs 51866 per ha for contract farms and only Rs 800 per ha under non-contract system. Benefit-cost ratio on various costs {{has been found to}} vary from 1. 40 to 1. 02 for without contract and from 2. 71 and 2. 08 for contract farming. The impact of contract farming has been quite visible and remarkably favourable on yield and profitability of potato production at the existing pattern of resource-use and production technology prevalent in the Haryana farming system. The regression analysis has indicated significant influence of manure and fertilizers and human labour on the return of potatoes grown under contract farming situation. MVP-MFC ratios of plant protection, manure-fertilizers and human labour have been found much higher, indicating tremendous scope to increase the profitability in potato <b>production</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming situation whereas in the case of non-contract system, irrigation and plant protection have shown sufficient scope to raise the crop income. The yield uncertainty has been less in contract than non-contract potato production. There has been no price uncertainty in the contract farming of potato whereas in the non-contract system, it exits to a large extent due variations in the price of potatoes sold in the market. These findings have clearly underlined the superiority of contract farming over non-contract farming system in potato production. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 4 March 1996 As several {{scholars and}} policy institutions have shown, small-scale contract farming {{has become increasingly}} popular {{in recent years as}} a model for organising agricultural production at the margins of the international agro-food economy (Glover and Kusterer 1990; Little and Watts 1994; World Bank 1981). Broadly defined, contract farming refers to "arrangements between a grower and firm(s) (exporters, processors, retail outlets, or shippers, for example) in which nontransferable contracts specify one or more conditions of marketing and production" (Little and Watts 1994 : 4). Proponents of the model note that it underwrites a dynamic partnership between the processing company and the small-grower farmer, with strong advantages for both parties. The company takes on the risks of marketing but is able to relinquish to the grower the risks of production, including the management of a labour force which may be seasonal. The grower, on the other hand, gains a secure market and access to credit inputs and to the technical capacity of the company (Glover 1984; Levin 1988). In short, proponents argue, such contracts can bring wealth, entrepreneurship and employment to rural communities. In that respect, contract schemes might be regarded as vehicles for modernization [...] The idea of a farming contract as a developmental institution is particularly provocative in parts of post-apartheid South Africa where the economic imperatives which press agribusiness companies to seek new opportunities for flexible accumulation are converging dramatically with the political imperatives of democratic transition. In rural KwaZulu-Natal, the first set of imperatives has invigorated sugar and timber milling companies to promote contract schemes with farmers occupying old bantustan land under 'traditional' tenure. Through these schemes the companies gain access to land outside of the freehold sector, and are able to reduce their labour costs. The companies see the contract operation as a commercial agreement which generates economic growth, employment and entrepreneurship in rural communities (a'Bear et al 1994). The second set of imperatives prescribes a restructuring of the state to re-link the old bantustans and their impoverished populations with the central state and the national political economy. The post-apartheid Government of National Unity (GNU) faces the massive challenge of increasing both the quality of economic opportunity and the quality of citizenship for rural people. At a minimum, this requires a new impetus and new institutions for rural development at the local level. But state-sponsored rural development agencies lack legitimacy and capacity, especially in the bantustans where apartheid administrative structures are strongly entrenched (Macintosh 1990; May 1993 : 23 - 24; Kotze et al 1987). Moreover, government agencies are frequently under-funded, unco-ordinated and inefficient at the local level, creating space for fluid local politics which deeply complicates government approaches to state construction. In this respect, South Africa faces the same structural development challenges as other post-colonial regimes (Munro 1996). The GNU has set out to address these constraints through a wide-ranging Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) based on a new 'social partnership' or 'social compact' which aims to eradicate perceptions of the state's overweening, dominant, or central role in society. A central objective of the RDP is to 'build the capacity' of community-based organisations to fill the void left by a retreating state. s As the government's first White Paper on the RDP argued (GNU 1994 : 48) : The empowerment of institutions of civil society is a fundamental aim of the Government's approach to building national consensus. Through this process the Government aims to draw on the creative energy of communities. To facilitate effective involvement, the Government will introduce programmes that will enhance the capacity of community organisations. The government's Rural Development Strategy (GNU 1995) aims to combine economic development and political development on the basis of three (populist) objectives: entrepreneurship, employment and empowerment. The thrust of this approach is to bring governance closer to the people, mainly by expanding the role of local authorities in delivering basic services and spreading the responsibility for the distribution of public resources across communily-bascd organisations (CBOs), non-government organisations (NGOs) as well as state institutions. The approach is predicated on the capacity or propensity of rural communities to undertake developmental collective action. Among rural communities where none of these institutions are well developed, the developmental potential of growers' organisations stands out as particularly promising. It is in these circumstances that they have emerged as a potentially attractive focus for promoting 'community development and empowerment' (A'Bear et al 1994) as well as economic development. This paper aims to evaluate that vision by analysing the social relations of contract production among sugar and timber small-growers in KwaZulu. This approach derives from the perspective that the propensity of rural citizens to pursue developmental collective action is conditioned by local patterns of social conflict and local mechanisms to mitigate it. Thus, the underlying premise of the paper is that the capacity of contract farming to underwrite rural empowerment is determined ultimately by the political dynamics that structure the organisation of <b>production</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> arrangements. Ultimately, an evaluation of the potential of contract farming arrangements must begin with the peculiar social structure of the contract farmer's enterprise which establishes a complex set of local-level power relations between farmers, agribusiness, local authorities and communities. This requires an examination of the social networks through which contract growers manage their access to the main social factors of production - land, labour and capital inputs. The main aim of the paper is to delineate the power relations that inform each of these dimensions of the farming operation in order to cast light on the political underpinnings of growers' organisations as an institutional focus for rural development. It shows that each of these dimensions generates flexible arrangements for resource-utilisation which shape local-level social conflicts. Any developmental institution building initiative that seeks to promote empowerment must be able to respond to these relations. The paper proceeds in three parts. The first section briefly outlines the structural political tensions that {{lie at the heart of}} a development vision based on economic entrepreneurship and community empowerment. The second analyses the cash-cropping enterprise and highlights incipient social conflicts that it generates. It shows that the factors of production are commoditised to different degrees, and that growers engage in distinct, though overlapping, social networks to manage their access to these factors. The third indicates the complexities of moving from contract to community in development thinking, given the incipient conflicts that structure the enterprise...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the effect of participating in crop and livestock insurance on many aspects of farmers' business decision making. In Chapter 2, we investigate the effect of crop insurance enrollment on contract terms and farmers' participation in marketing contracts. Our model shows that improved terms of crop insurance (lower premium, higher subsidy) make contracts less appealing to farmers as mechanisms to mitigate risk. Therefore, intermediaries may revise their contract offers {{so that they are}} more attractive. However, improvements in contract terms are limited by their cost to the intermediaries, and will not lead to expanded participation in contracts. Thus, improved insurance terms may not crowd out participation in contracts, but will not expand participation either. In Chapter 3, we use various data sources and 2 SLS to empirically test the predictions out of the model we developed in Chapter 2. Specifically, we look at how crop insurance enrollment affects farmers' share of value of <b>production</b> <b>under</b> marketing <b>contracts.</b> We construct a pseudo panel out of the repeated observations from the agricultural and resource management survey (ARMS) data. We use lagged county level subsidy and total precipitation as IVs for insurance enrollment. The second stage result indicates that, in peanut sector, farms with higher possibility of insurance enrollment will have more share of value of <b>production</b> <b>under</b> marketing <b>contracts</b> as well. In Chapter 4, we explore the relationship between farmers' use of livestock insurance and debt use. Risk balancing hypothesis (RBH) suggests that an exogenous reduction in farm's business risk would result in farmers taking more financial risk. We utilize a natural experiment from Jiyuan city in Henan province, China and regression discontinuity design approach to test the RBH. Our empirical results suggest that, farmers that are selected into the compulsory hog insurance program are 20 percent more likely to be willing to take debt than those who are not. Meanwhile, the difference of probability of taking debt between the two groups is insignificant. The combination of the two results indicates that farmers are willing to take more debt after insurance is available. However, the presence of credit constraint prevents them from taking more debt...|$|R
