The present study is based on panel data over the period of 2009 - 2013.

Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between the public and <b>private</b> <b>sectors,</b> with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{relations}} {{between government and}} the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Malawi from independence to the present. The analysis charts the changing emphasis that official policy has attached {{to the role of}} the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> throughout the transition from dictatorship to democracy; and from a PRSP that effectively ignored the role of the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in national development, to the current more balanced approach that recognises the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> as the 'engine of economic growth' and the best means of achieving poverty reduction. However, in spite of progress, Malawi's <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> remains fragile and while the rhetoric from the highest levels of government towards the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> has evolved, the enabling environment for <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> development is still inhospitable.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operations}} and discusses {{the effectiveness of}} public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> provision of solid waste collection in Kampala, Uganda. Household {{data suggest that the}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is more effective than the public <b>sector.</b> <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> companies provide services like container provision and providing timely and fixed collection time tables. Contrary to popular perception, fees charged by private companies are moderate. Public sector clients are charged fees even when the service is supposed to be free. Clients of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> providers are more satisfied than those of public sector providers. It is however, revealed that while public sector serve mainly the low incomes, the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> serves mainly the rich. In spite of these notable differences, clients of both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> perceive the problem of solid waste management (SWM) in Kampala to be very serious. The effectiveness of public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> operations in solid waste collection in Kampala is hampered by corruption and lack of transparency. Given the situation of open competition for clients involving both public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Kampala, it is possible the public sector can operate effectively if they start commercial services officially like their <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> counterparts. This calls for a formal public-private partnership where the public and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> can work together with the public sector dominating poor and marginalized areas while the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> concentrates on rich neighborhoods...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, public and <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks {{have been built}} along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{involvement}} in solid waste collection, {{and the influence of}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> capacity and local governments‘ regulations on <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> performance. <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement in public service pro-vision evolved to deal with market and government failures (van Dijk, 2008 b). The public sector is playing a leading role of purchaser (buyer) on behalf of citi-zens through subsidies and/or user charges, whiles the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is taking on an increasing role as provider (seller) of public services, and being regulated by the public sector to correct market failures associated with ‗public good‘ nature of solid waste service. It is believed that <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement is a way to maintain market discipline and to bring <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> management and technical expertise and private finance into public service to achieve cost efficiency and better service provision (improve service quality) (Cointreau, 1994; Bartone, 2001; van Dijk, 2008 b). Even though <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> involvement (PSI) provides opportunities for improved efficiency and service quality, the few studies on PSI in solid waste management in developing countries did not explore the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> performance to ascertain the expected gains and the factors influencing efficiency and service quality at the firm level. The main objective of this research is to examine the evolving involvement of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in urban solid waste collection, and the factors explaining dif-ferences in performance of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> companies.

The third result indicates unidirectional causation from <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit to the exchange rate. The reverse is not true. This implies that exchange rates do not necessarily affect <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit. Indeed, results from the normalized cointegrating equation reveal that exchange rates are not significant in the long-run <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit equation. Similarly, short-run dynamics in the VEC model show that the coefficient of the ECT in the exchange rate equation is not significant although it bears the expected negative sign. The fourth result reveals bi-directional causation between core CPI and <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit, implying that inflation affects <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> credit and that the reverse is also true.|$|R
