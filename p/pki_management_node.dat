30|$|The initial {{power is}} equal {{for all the}} <b>nodes.</b> A <b>management</b> <b>node</b> is {{randomly}} chosen in an arbitrary alliance. Centered by this <b>management</b> <b>node,</b> the routing protocol is transmitted in a single-hop or multiple-hop method. Assuming that the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> is deployed in advance with unlimited power, it could communicate directly with all the member nodes. However, the member nodes need to perform single-hop or multiple-hop routing to reach the <b>management</b> <b>node.</b> This is an optimization problem which minimizes the cost from the source to the destination. Since the energy consumption models, i.e., the calculation model for the communication energy, the calculation model for the data processing energy and the calculation model for the environment sensing energy, are definite, upon receiving one message, the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> could trace the energy change of all the nodes processing this message according to energy models, the message length and the data quantity. For each round of cycles, the nodes in the alliance are divided into three states according to the protocol, i.e., work, election, and sleep. Sensing nodes only take charge of monitoring the environment and collecting data. Relay nodes {{are in charge of}} relaying data while sensing relay nodes possess both of these two functions. When inactive nodes are switched to the sleep state, the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> determines the state of each node according to the node energy, topology, and network task. When the routing is established, the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> broadcasts the node state and routing information to all the nodes. Due to message loss and data processing delay, there may be errors in the energy calculation model for the <b>management</b> <b>node.</b> Therefore, the member nodes are required to transmit the energy update message on the present energy to the <b>management</b> <b>nodes.</b> Then, the optimal routing is calculated and broadcasted to the members in the alliance by the <b>management</b> <b>node.</b>|$|R
30|$|At the beginning, {{since all}} the nodes have the same initial energy and the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> is chosen randomly, the energy are {{consumed}} by all the nodes to some extent after one or several working rounds. According to the proposed algorithm, the node with more remained energy is chosen as the <b>management</b> <b>node</b> for the next round. Meanwhile, the rank of all the nodes is updated in the link. During {{the establishment of the}} alliance, each node randomly chooses a real number between 0 and 1. If this number is smaller than a certain threshold, this node is chosen as the <b>management</b> <b>node.</b> Then, the identification of this <b>management</b> <b>node</b> is broadcasted to all the nodes. Each node determines its own alliance according to the amplitude of the receiving signal and broadcasts its membership to all of the alliance members. During the data transmission period, all the member nodes transmit data to the <b>management</b> <b>nodes</b> in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slots while the <b>management</b> <b>nodes</b> integrate the receiving data and broadcast them to the base station. After several working rounds, the network is restarted. Then, the next round of election for the <b>management</b> <b>nodes</b> is performed and the new alliances are established.|$|R

It also considers the residual energy of a node and {{a situation in which the}} node is selected by several other events.

The self-organized public key management scheme that each node creates and manages certificates by itself has been proposed for the network that does not connect to the Internet with a certificate authority. However, it needs large time and loads heavy traffic to collect all certificates in the network. In this paper, we propose public key management scheme with repository <b>management</b> <b>node</b> that collects certificates of each node in its power range. This proposed scheme consists of selecting certificate <b>management</b> <b>node</b> (CMN) and clustering techniques. It can reduce the time to collect certificates from the CMN when normal nodes access to the CMN. Furthermore, our proposed scheme can reduce memory and traffic loads because normal nodes neither have all certificates nor exchange repositories each other.

One of the main differences between our proposal and the scheme described there is the routing scheme used as base. We make use of the OLSR proactive scheme (more specifically we use the MPR technique used there), while the reactive AODV routing protocol is used by the other proposal. The main idea behind this alternative is to build a binary tree of trust connecting all the nodes in the network claiming that this structure will simplify certificate path discovery and certificate issuance. The main difficulties behind the use of such a global structure is that network partition may occur easily since each node only has direct trusted connections with its parent and two-child nodes.
