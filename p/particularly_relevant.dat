5|$|As {{the capital}} and largest city of Macedonia, Skopje has many major {{sporting}} facilities. The city has three large swimming pools, two of which feature Olympic pools. These pools are <b>particularly</b> <b>relevant</b> to coaching water polo teams. Skopje also boasts many football stadiums, like Ilinden in Čair and Železarnica, which can accommodate between 4,000 and 4,500 spectators. The basketball court Kale can accommodate 5 000 people and the court of Jane Sandanski, 4000 people.|$|E
5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one <b>particularly</b> <b>relevant</b> example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E

5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis.

Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is <b>particularly</b> <b>relevant</b> for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E
5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are <b>particularly</b> <b>relevant</b> to molecular biology.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be <b>particularly</b> <b>relevant</b> to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi.

The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E
