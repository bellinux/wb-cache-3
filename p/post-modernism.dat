5|$|Paintings {{of early}} modernist {{painters}} such as Damián Domingo often {{still had a}} religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used <b>post-modernism</b> to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s {{there was}} a {{backlash}} against the statism and compressive nature of modernist architecture. Instead {{there was a}} move towards a form of <b>post-modernism</b> that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also {{a combination of the}} private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988–89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985–87, extended 1993–94). The most significant figure in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980–86).|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{many artists}} have started using {{barcodes}} in art, such as Scott Blake's Barcode Jesus, {{as part of}} the <b>post-modernism</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post-modernism</b> was {{introduced}} to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also attached to this approach to criticism. <b>Post-modernism</b> does not {{claim to be a}} movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature in the light of its content—mostly examining features like feminism, dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{the modernist}} {{movement}} has waned somewhat, {{but is still}} represented by composers like Veli-Matti Puumala and Lotta Wennäkoski. Juhani Nuorvala is a rare minimalist, whereas Osmo Tapio Räihälä and Sebastian Fagerlund are leaning more towards <b>post-modernism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{music is}} a mixture of styles and the theme itself suggest an Italian version of <b>post-modernism.</b> Neo-tonal materials, already adumbrating the {{synthesis}} of 19th-century opera and postwar popular music typical of his later works, are mixed with modernist orchestral textures.|$|E
25|$|Choate's {{curriculum}} includes elective and interdisciplinary courses, from {{astronomy and}} architecture to printmaking and <b>post-modernism</b> to digital video and development economics.

There is Advanced Placement (AP) preparation in 27 areas.|$|E
25|$|Leftist postmodernism opposes {{attempts}} to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as grand narratives. It views {{culture as a}} contested space and via deconstruction seeks to undermine all pretensions to absolute truth. Left-wing critics of <b>post-modernism</b> assert that cultural studies inflates the importance of culture by denying {{the existence of an}} independent reality.|$|E
25|$|In {{the visual}} arts, late modernism {{encompasses}} the overall production of most recent art {{made between the}} aftermath of World War II and {{the early years of}} the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and <b>post-modernism</b> although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is contemporary art. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for <b>post-modernism</b> or other reasons. Arthur Danto argues explicitly in After the End of Art that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: Hilton Kramer, Robert C. Morgan, Kirk Varnedoe, Jean-François Lyotard and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.|$|E
25|$|The Brazilian Modernism, {{evidenced}} by the Week of Modern Art in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature, while <b>Post-Modernism</b> brought a generation of distinct poets like João Cabral de Melo Neto, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cora Coralina, Graciliano Ramos, Cecília Meireles, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like Jorge Amado, João Guimarães Rosa, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira.|$|E
25|$|One compact {{definition}} offered is {{that while}} <b>post-modernism</b> acts in rejection of modernism's grand narratives of artistic direction, and to eradicate the boundaries {{between high and low}} forms of art, to disrupt genre and its conventions with collision, collage and fragmentation. Post-modern art is seen as believing that all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore irony, parody and humor are the only positions which cannot be overturned by critique or later events.|$|E
25|$|The 19th and early-20th-century {{architectural}} revivals {{brought about}} {{the building of a}} great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, including St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago, St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee, Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh and Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal, which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. <b>Post-Modernism</b> has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro.|$|E
25|$|The {{time frame}} is usually near-future and the {{settings}} are often dystopian in nature. Common themes in cyberpunk include advances {{in information technology}} and especially the Internet, visually abstracted as cyberspace, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics and post-democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments. Nihilism, <b>post-modernism,</b> and film noir techniques are common elements, and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant anti-heroes. Noteworthy authors in this genre are William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and Pat Cadigan. James O'Ehley has called Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner a definitive example of the cyberpunk visual style.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This {{is not to say}} that the phase of art denoted by <b>post-modernism</b> is accepted, merely that the need for a term to {{describe}} movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} twentieth-century {{art is a}} {{narrative}} of endless possibilities {{and the search for}} new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and <b>Post-Modernism</b> exerting a powerful influence.|$|E
25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken {{on a life of its}} own and a wide range of ideas including <b>post-modernism,</b> autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E
25|$|The 1932 {{competition}} for the Palace of the Soviets, a grandiose project to rival the Empire State Building, featured entries from all the major Constructivists as well as Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn and Le Corbusier. However, this coincided with widespread criticism of Modernism, which was always difficult to sustain in a still mostly agrarian country. There was also the critique that the style merely copied the forms of technology while using fairly routine construction methods. The winning entry by Boris Iofan marked the start of eclectic historicism of Stalinist Architecture, a style which bears similarities to <b>Post-Modernism</b> in that it reacted against modernist architecture's cosmopolitanism, alleged ugliness and inhumanity with a pick and mix of historical styles, sometimes achieved with new technology. Housing projects like the Narkomfin were designed for the attempts to reform everyday life in the 1920s, such as collectivisation of facilities, equality of the sexes and collective raising of children, all of which fell out of favour as Stalinism revived family values. The styles {{of the old world}} were also revived, with the Moscow Metro in particular popularising the idea of 'workers' palaces'.|$|E

500|$|During the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali {{literature}} was modernised through {{the works of}} authors such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Coupled with social reforms led by Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, and others, this constituted {{a major part of}} the Bengal Renaissance. The middle and latter parts of the 20th century witnessed the arrival of <b>post-modernism,</b> as well as literary movements such as those espoused by the Kallol movement, hungryalists and the little magazines. Large majority of publishers of the city is concentrated in and around College Street, [...] "...a half-mile of bookshops and bookstalls spilling over onto the pavement", selling new and used books.|$|E
500|$|Pei's {{style is}} {{described}} as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: [...] "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." [...] In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei [...] "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: [...] "The talk about modernism versus <b>post-modernism</b> is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style {{in which it is}} going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?" ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the radical}} plan form and large {{scale of the}} New City {{attracted}} international attention, early phases of the city include work by celebrated architects, including Sir Richard MacCormac, Lord Norman Foster, Henning Larsen, Ralph Erskine, John Winter, and Martin Richardson. The Corporation itself attracted talented young architects led by the young and charismatic Derek Walker. Its strongly modernist designs featured regularly in the magazines Architectural Design and the Architects' Journal. Though strongly committed to sleek [...] "Miesian" [...] minimalism inspired by the German/ American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, they also developed a strand of contextualism {{in advance of the}} wider adoption of commercial <b>Post-Modernism</b> as an architectural style in the 1980s. In the Miesian tradition were the Pineham Sewage Works, which Derek Walker regarded as his finest achievement, and the Shopping Building designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward. The contextual tradition that ran alongside it is exemplified by the Coproration's infill scheme at Cofferidge Close, Stony Stratford, designed by Wayland Tunley, which inserts into a historic stretch of High Street a modern retail facility, offices and car park.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and criticized various {{elements}} of the episode's direction.

And Chris Carter the director has stamped all over it and made it so arch and obvious and dull that it kills it stone dead." [...] Shearman and Pearson praised the idea of [...] "a town which feels like an X-Files audience", but derided the episode's comic book setting and wrote that [...] "this play on <b>post-modernism</b> just doesn't make any sense [...] a comic has action, a way of jumping from frame to frame... this is languorous and self-indulgent." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that the episode [...] "falls flatter than the chemical pancakes used to anesthetize the victims of this episode" [...] due to its [...] "collection of situations and observances that bear little relation to each other." [...] Vitaris also criticized the scene wherein various characters are compared to animals, and commented, [...] "the mean spiritedness of [...] is mind-boggling". Finally, she called the episode's conclusion a [...] "false ending".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{of these}} traits {{are present in}} modern {{movements}} in art, particularly {{the rejection of the}} separation between high and low forms of art. However, these traits are considered fundamental to post-modern art, as opposed to merely present in one degree or another. One of the most important points of difference, however, between <b>post-modernism,</b> and modernism, as movements in art, is modernism's ultimately progressive stance that new works be more [...] "forward looking" [...] and advanced, whereas post-modern movements generally reject the notion that there can be advancement or progress in art per se, and thus one of the projects of art must be the overturning of the [...] "myth of the avant-garde". This relates to the negation of what post-structuralist philosophers call [...] "metanarratives".|$|E
2500|$|The rise of <b>post-modernism</b> made camp {{a common}} {{perspective}} on aesthetics, {{which was not}} identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-Stonewall gay male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as effeminacy. Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: swish and drag. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things [...] "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators (faux queens), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of Carmen Miranda. It was {{this version of the}} concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines camp as [...] "queer parody".|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} a Modernist will to {{aesthetic}} isolation and of the broad theme {{of the separation of}} culture and society, it is actually Cubism after 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and <b>post-modernism</b> now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after.

2500|$|Late modernism {{describes}} movements {{which both}} arise from, and react against, trends in modernism and reject {{some aspect of}} modernism, while fully developing the conceptual potentiality of the modernist enterprise. In some descriptions <b>post-modernism</b> as a period in art is completed, whereas in others it is a continuing movement in contemporary art. In art, the specific traits of modernism which are cited are generally formal purity, medium specificity, art for art's sake, the possibility of authenticity in art, the importance or even possibility of universal truth in art, {{and the importance of}} an avant-garde and originality. This last point is one of particular controversy in art, where many institutions argue that being visionary, forward looking, cutting edge and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and that postmodern therefore, represents a contradiction of the value of [...] "art of our times".|$|E
2500|$|The {{intellectual}} scholarship regarding postmodernism {{and architecture}} is closely {{linked with the}} writings of critic-turned-architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay [...] "The rise of post-modern architecture" [...] from 1975. His magnum opus, however, is the book The Language of Post-Modern Architecture, first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks {{makes the point that}} <b>Post-Modernism</b> (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture {{it is not just a}} reaction to Modernism but what he terms double coding: [...] "Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects." [...] Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons by compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were Robert Venturi, Robert Stern, Charles Moore, Michael Graves, Leon Krier, and James Stirling.|$|E

In 1971 he partook {{in a televised}} debate with French philosopher Michel Foucault on Dutch television, entitled Human Nature: Justice versus Power. Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of <b>post-modernism</b> and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid {{the cause of the}} working-classes and lambasting France as having [...] "a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture". Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972), an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972), and Reflections on Language (1975). In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.|$|E

These trends were reflected in and influenced by lively debates within the field and critiques from various sources, including feminism and <b>post-modernism,</b> that reflected in part the cultural and political tenor of the times, and which foreshadowed the emergence (in the 1980s and 1990s) of the various [...] "post-systems" [...] constructivist and social constructionist approaches. While there was still debate within the field about whether, or to what degree, the systemic-constructivist and medical-biological paradigms were necessarily [...] to each other (see also Anti-psychiatry; Biopsychosocial model), there was a growing willingness and tendency on the part of family therapists to work in multi-modal clinical partnerships {{with other members of the}} [...] and medical professions.|$|E

[...] According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience." [...] Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of Clifford Geertz’s theories on culture." [...] Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one’s understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.|$|E
