50|$|<b>Pedocal</b> is a {{subdivision}} of the zonal soil order. It is {{a class of}} soil which forms in semiarid and arid regions. It is rich in calcium carbonate and has low soil organic matter. With only a thin A horizon (topsoil), and intermittent precipitation calcite, other soluble minerals ordinarily removed by water may build up in the B horizon (subsoil) forming a cemented layer known as caliche. It is not used in the current United States system of soil classification but the term commonly shows up in college geology texts.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the handout is to {{identify}} the three major types of soils: pedalfer, <b>pedocal,</b> and laterite, and to understand the soil profile. This is accomplished with brief descriptions of the soil horizons and the designation of common elements to pedalfers, pedocals, and laterite soils. The handout is concluded {{with a discussion of}} soil erosion. Links are provided to the online Physical Geology resources at Georgia Perimeter College. Educational levels: Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Examination {{of field}} samples hows that the {{alteration}} of the ben-tonite beds of Wyoming and Montana {{near the surface}} to produce high-quality, high-swelling, commercial bentonites i analogous to <b>pedocal</b> soil development. The near surface bentonite has undergone xtensive calcification, and in some zones it is so heavily altered as to diminish its swelling properties. These low-swelling bentonites can be activated by conventional soda-ash additions. The naturally high-swelling materials have undergone only partial calcification and do not require soda-ash modi-fication. The relatively unaltered 'grey ' or 'blue ' bentonites have undergone little or no calcification. The latter have the highest Na to Ca ratios, are non-swelling, and do not respond markedly to soda-ash additions. Such low-swelling materials will respond to calcium-activation with markedly improved physical quality parameters of flocculation as measured by Marsh Funnel and Fann viscosimeter. The study indicates that vast reserves of low-swelling bentonites in Montana-Wyoming may be susceptible to con-trolled calcium activation and expanded commercial utilization...|$|E
50|$|In 1920 Marbut {{began his}} work on a soil {{classification}} scheme. In 1927 he published a translation of Glinka's The Great Soil Groups of the World and their Development from German to English. His classification scheme became the 1935 system that was modified to become the system published in the 1938 Yearbook of Agriculture, Soils and Men: the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy. At {{the highest level of}} classification the soils were divided into <b>pedocals</b> and pedalfers. <b>Pedocals</b> were used in the drier climates and referred to the carbonate rich soils. The Pedalfers began about at the Udic border and referred to soils rich in Aluminum (Alumen) and Iron (Ferrous). Alfer became the root term for Alfisols.|$|R

Grasslands {{are made up of}} [...] Astrebla pectinate and Eulalia fulca that grow on the heavy grey <b>pedocals.</b> Fringing forest is made up of a mix of Corymbia papuana, Eucalyptus tectifica and Eucalyptus microtheca.|$|R
