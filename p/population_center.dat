5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's <b>population</b> <b>center.</b> Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest <b>population</b> <b>center</b> in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major <b>population</b> <b>center.</b> It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of the airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. With the subway providing a quick and cheap commute, Forest Hills became a more desirable place to live, {{and as a result}} new apartment buildings were built in advance of the line's opening to accommodate the expected influx of residents. Forest Hills was transformed from a quiet residential community of one-family houses to an active <b>population</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
5|$|Below Lewiston Dam the Trinity River {{passes the}} towns of Lewiston and Douglas City and turns west, passing within {{a few miles of}} Weaverville, the seat of Trinity County and the main <b>population</b> <b>center</b> of the area. It then turns northwest, past Junction City, and {{receives}} the North Fork Trinity River at Helena. Further west it passes the former mining settlement of Big Bar and enters a deep gorge, which provides the route for Highway 299, the principal road connecting Redding to the Humboldt Bay area. At Burnt Ranch it receives the New River from the north. At Salyer the South Fork, its main tributary, enters from the south, nearly doubling the flow.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major <b>population</b> <b>center</b> (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major <b>population</b> <b>center</b> was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Onondaga territory, {{the route}} {{initially}} serves {{only a handful}} of scattered homes separated by long stretches of dense forests. After , however, the road bends to the northeast and enters the town of Onondaga and the hamlet of Indian Village, the main <b>population</b> <b>center</b> of the reservation. NY11A quickly runs through the linear community, crossing Hemlock Creek on its way to another lightly developed, mostly wooded stretch along the east bank of Onondaga Creek. The route passes {{only a handful of}} isolated homes before ending at an intersection with US11 on the northern edge of the reservation. The junction is located just south of the hamlet of Nedrow, located along US11 between the Onondaga territory and the Syracuse city line.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} {{originally}} {{settled in the}} late 17thcentury by Jacob Rutsen, a merchant from Albany, but did not become a major <b>population</b> <b>center</b> until the 1825 discovery of Rosendale cement in the region; {{the development of the}} cement industry, and the growth of the Delaware and Hudson Canal along the Rondout Creek and Main Street, gave rise to substantial economic development in Rosendale. The town's cement was used in the construction of numerous national landmarks. The Wallkill Valley Railroad reached the village in 1871, and its depot in the village was the largest station on the Wallkill Valley line. Rosendale was formally incorporated as a village in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and <b>population</b> <b>center</b> of Southern California.|$|E
