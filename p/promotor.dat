5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, <b>promotor</b> of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a slab of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It {{was made by the}} cabinet maker Frederic Labòria, who also collaborated with Gaudí on the Sagrada Família.|$|E

The committee appointed by the Health Council conclude that the use of antimicrobial growth <b>promotors</b> contributes to the problem of resistance among human pathogens. The conclusions are based on evidence regarding the development of resistance in livestock {{as the result of the}} use of antimicrobial growth <b>promotors,</b> the possibility of colonisation/infection of humans with resistance bacteria from the intestinal flora of productive livestock, and the transfer of resistance genes from livestock bacteria to human pathogenic microorganisms. Effective measures for the limitation of the public health risk should focus on termination of the use of antimicrobial growth <b>promotors</b> that confer resistance to (relate) antibiotics currently used (or which will be available) to treat patients suffering from bacterial infections. In addition, the committee advised ending the use of antimicrobial growth <b>promotors</b> in 3 years...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} {{of the different}} modes of action of metal catalyst <b>promotors.</b> Broadly two main categories can be distinguished: structural and bifunctional <b>promotors.</b> In structural promotion the promoting atoms do not participate themselves in the elementary steps of a catalytic reaction. Bifunctional <b>promotors</b> participate themselves chemically in the catalytic reaction. Five different kinds of structural promotion can be recognized: ensemble-size regulating; valence-state promotion; polarizing-structural promotion; surface-phase and cluster complex promotion; particle size stabilizing. Each subcategory is discussed shortly and when relevant illustrated with a practical example. Three different kinds of bifunctional <b>promotors</b> can be distinguished: Polarizing-bifunctional promotion; direct-bifunctional promotion; chemical-bifunctional promotion. Whereas conceptually different, subcategories are not always easily experimentally distinguishable. Of most of {{the different kinds of}} promotion theoretical treatments exists.

25|$|The {{discussion}} of the particular miracles proceeded {{in exactly the same}} way and in the same order as that of the virtues. If the decisions were favourable, the general meeting of the Congregation was followed by a decree, confirmed by the Pope, in which it was announced that there was proof of miracles. In the positio for the ante-preparatory congregation there were required and were printed opinions of two physicians, one of whom had been chosen by the Postulator and the other by the Congregation of Rites. Of the three reports (positiones) above mentioned, and which were now also required, the first was prepared in the usual way; the second consisted of an exposition of the heroic virtues of the servant of God, an information, and a reply to later observations of the <b>Promotor</b> of the Faith; the last consisted only of an answer to his final observations.|$|E

40|$|The {{studies on}} {{populations in the}} course of forest {{succession}} in abandoned meadows (15 ha) were conducted for 15 years (1974 - 1988). It was found that the population size of species which took part in the successional process either changed directionally, i. e. developmental phases of populations conformed to the succession stages, or fluctuated, when no direct relationship between both was determined. Three types of population dynamics were distinguished: 1) developmental cycle (increase, decrease and equilibrium in population size) lasted as long as forest comeback; 2) developmental cycle accompanied one successional phase; 3) species appeared in cycles, as a series of populations {{in the course of}} long-term succession. Following species groups were distinguished regarding their role in the vegetation transformation in unmown meadows: 1) long-term <b>promotors,</b> present throughout succession and affecting both, changes in meadow vegetation, and initiation of tall-herb and brushwood communities; 2) short-term <b>promotors,</b> present in the first successional phases, especially at the stage of transformation of meadow phytocoenoses; 3) stenoecious <b>promotors,</b> confined to various depressions, periodically or permanently overlogged.

25|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the understanding of the regulation of IL-17. At first, Aggarwal et al. showed that production of IL-17 was dependent on IL-23. Later, a Korean group discovered that STAT3 and NF-κB signalling pathways are required for this IL-23-mediated IL-17 production. Consistent with this finding, Chen et al. showed that another molecule, SOCS3, plays an important role in IL-17 production. In the absence of SOCS3, IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation is enhanced, and phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the <b>promotor</b> regions of both IL-17A and IL-17F increasing their gene activity. In contrast, some scientists believe IL-17 induction is independent of IL-23. Several groups have identified ways to induce IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo by distinct cytokines, called TGF-β and IL-6, without the need for IL-23. Although IL-23 is not required for IL-17 expression in this situation, IL-23 may play a role in promoting survival and/or proliferation of the IL-17 producing T-cells. Recently, Ivanov et al. found that the thymus specific nuclear receptor, ROR-γ, directs differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells.|$|E

Alkali metal oxides and copper are common <b>promotors,</b> but the formulation depends on the primary metal, iron vs cobalt. Alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings. C≥5 and CO2 selectivity increase while methane and C2–C4 selectivity decrease.
