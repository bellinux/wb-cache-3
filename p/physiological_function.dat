5|$|The <b>physiological</b> <b>function</b> of the AH {{receptor}} {{has been}} the subject of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal <b>physiological</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>physiological</b> <b>function</b> of the {{prion protein}} remains a {{controversial}} matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, {{it was found}} that the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann cells and that the lack of PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: Presently, skin-cleaning {{agents that}} claim to be removed by water or wiping alone are commercially {{available}} and {{have been used for}} the purpose of bed baths. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on how water washing and wiping differently affect skin <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> or ceramide content. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of water washing and wiping on skin <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> and ceramide content. Methods: Three kinds of the cleaning agents with different removal techniques (ie, water washing and wiping) were used in this study. Skin <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> (ie, transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, and skin pH) and skin ceramide content were measured before and after seven consecutive days of the application of each cleaning agent. Results: No significant differences in skin <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> or ceramide content were observed between water washing and wiping. Conclusion: Cleaning agents {{that claim to}} be removed by water washing or wiping do not affect skin <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> or ceramide content by either removal method. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. in Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

25|$|Myoglobin was {{the first}} protein to have its {{three-dimensional}} structure revealed by X-ray crystallography. This achievement was reported in 1958 by John Kendrew and associates. For this discovery, John Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz. Despite {{being one of the}} most studied proteins in biology, its <b>physiological</b> <b>function</b> is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin can be viable and fertile but show many cellular and physiological adaptations to overcome the loss. Through observing these changes in myoglobin-deplete mice, it is hypothesised that myoglobin function relates to increased oxygen transport to muscle, oxygen storage and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} tests {{differ from}} most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the <b>physiological</b> <b>function</b> {{of the system}} being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and octreotide scans.|$|E
25|$|In October 1879, Sherrington entered Cambridge as a non-collegiate student. The {{following}} year he entered Gonville and Caius College. Sherrington was quite the student. In June 1881 he took Part I in the Natural Sciences Tripos and {{was awarded a}} starred First in physiology; there were 9 candidates in all (8 men, 1 woman), of whom five gained Firsts; in June 1883 in Part II of the Tripos he also gained a First, alongside William Bateson. Walter Holbrook Gaskell, one of Sherrington's tutors, informed him in November 1881 that he had earned the highest marks for his year in botany, human anatomy, and physiology; second in zoology; and highest overall. John Newport Langley was Sherrington's other tutor. The two were interested in how anatomical structure is expressed in <b>physiological</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bile {{pigments}} such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant {{properties and}} therefore may fulfil a useful <b>physiological</b> <b>function.</b> Biliverdin and bilirubin {{have been shown}} to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} imaging {{involves the}} administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer. The {{most commonly used}} tracers are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, gallium-67, indium-111, thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose (18F) (18F-FDG). The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, brain, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying <b>physiological</b> <b>function.</b> The excretory function of the kidneys, iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid, blood flow to heart muscle, etc. can be measured. The principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the PET Scanner, which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer {{in the body and}} display it as an image. With computer processing, the information can be displayed as axial, coronal and sagittal images (single-photon emission computed tomography - SPECT or Positron-emission tomography - PET). In the most modern devices, nuclear medicine images can be fused with a CT scan taken quasisimultaneously, so the physiological information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>physiological</b> <b>function</b> of KLK3 is the {{dissolution}} of the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E

40|$|Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 -amino-acid cyclic peptide {{which was}} {{originally}} found to lighten skin color in fish {{that is highly}} conserved among many species. MCH interacts with two G-protein-coupled receptors, MCH 1 R and MCH 2 R, but only MCH 1 R is expressed in rodents. MCH is mainly synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta, while MCH 1 R is widely expressed throughout the brain. Thus, MCH signaling is implicated in the regulation of many <b>physiological</b> <b>functions.</b> The identification of MCH 1 R {{has led to the}} development of small-molecule MCH 1 R antagonists that can block MCH signaling. MCH 1 R antagonists are useful not only for their potential therapeutic value, but also for understanding the <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> of the endogenous MCH system. Here, we review the <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> of the MCH system which have been investigated using MCH 1 R antagonists such as food intake, anxiety, depression, reward, and sleep. This will help us understand the <b>physiological</b> <b>functions</b> of the MCH system and suggest some of the potential applications of MCH 1 R antagonists in human disorders...|$|R
