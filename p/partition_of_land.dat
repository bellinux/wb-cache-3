40|$|This study {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>land</b> fragmentation on agricultural development in Tivland of Benue State, Nigeria. The study {{reveals that the}} land tenure system in Tivland encourages <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> based on inheritance. A development which leads to excessive subdivision <b>of</b> <b>land</b> into plots <b>of</b> small sizes that are scattered over long walking distances. The study argues that due to small nature of farm sizes, farmers only engage in subsistence farming with barely surplus to generate income. Besides, the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>land</b> holdings and unstaggered planting does not allow the land {{to be put into}} effective productive use. The study recommends that policies and agricultural programmes in Nigeria should take into cognizance the existing land tenure systems and the problems that emanate from them. In addition, problems associated with small sized farms and dispersal of holdings can be resolved through the provision of infrastructural facilities. Finally, irrigation facilities should be introduced in Tivland to boost dry season farming...|$|R

40|$|With the {{formation}} of ZZK (Land Cadastre Statute) from the year 1974 to the year 2000 when ZENDMPE (Statute of Recording State Boarder and Land Use Units) came into force all the boundaries concerning land owners were settled with mutual agreement among them.

In that case the only solution to the problem was the court procedure, according to which the boarder was fixed. After ZENDMPE (Statute of Recording State Boarder and Land Use Units) had come into force, this kind of settling problems was in a way turned upside down. The leading role was given to the geodetist, who had to transfer the cadastral boarder to the nature respectively he had to check in what extent the shown boarders deviated from the cadastral boarders. There also had to be given the accuracy of the cadastral boarder.

The sensitivity study is carried out using MM 5 /PLACE, the Penn State/NCAR MM 5 model enhanced with the Parameterization for Land-Atmosphere-Cloud Exchange or PLACE. PLACE is a one-dimensional land surface model possessing detailed plant and soil water physics algorithms, multiple soil layers, {{and the capacity to}} model subgrid heterogeneity. A series of 12 -hour simulations were conducted with identical atmospheric initialization and land surface characterization but with different initial soil moisture and texture. A comparison then was made <b>of</b> the simulated <b>land</b> surface energy flux fields, the <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> net radiation into latent and sensible heat, and the soil moisture fields. Results indicate that heterogeneity in both soil moisture and texture affects the spatial distribution and <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> mesoscale energy balance. Spatial averaging results in an overprediction of latent heat flux, and an underestimation of sensible heat flux. In addition to the primary focus on the <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> surface energy, the modeling effort provided an opportunity to examine the issue of initializing the soil moisture fields for coupled three-dimensional models. For the present case, the initial soil moisture and temperature were determined from off-line modeling using PLACE at each grid box, driven with a combination of observed and assimilated data fields...|$|R
