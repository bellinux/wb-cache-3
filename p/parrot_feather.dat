50|$|<b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> is a {{perennial}} plant. <b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> gets {{its name from}} its feather-like leaves that are arranged around the stem in whorls of four to six. The emergent stems and leaves are the most distinctive trait of <b>parrot</b> <b>feather,</b> as they can grow up to a foot above the water surface and look almost like small fir trees. The woody emergent stems grow over 5 feet long and will extend {{to the bank and}} shore. Attached to the <b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> are pinkish-white flowers that extend approximately 1/16 inches long. As the water warms in the spring, <b>parrot</b> <b>feather</b> begins to flourish. Most plants flower in the spring; however, some also flower in the fall. Almost all plants of this species are female, in fact there are no male plants found outside of South America. Seeds are not produced in any North American plants. <b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> reproduces asexually. New plants grow from fragments of already rooted plants. The plant has whorls of feathery blue-green to waxy gray-green leaves deeply cut into many narrow lobes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Parrot’s</b> <b>feather,</b> {{a member}} of the water-milfoil family (Haloragaceae), is a {{herbaceous}} aquatic perennial that gets its name from the feather-like appearance of its graygreen leaves. The leaves are arranged around the stem in whorls of four to six, and may be submerged or emergent. Stiff, bright green, emergent leaves are 1 to 2 inches long with 10 to 18 segments per leaf. The stem and leaves can grow up to a foot above the water surface, giving the appearance of small fir trees. The submerged leaves are limp, but the stems are stiff and very vigorous. When attached to a bank, the plant can extend several yards across the water. Male and female flowers are on different plants, but only the female plants have been found in North America. Besides <b>parrot’s</b> <b>feather</b> and another nonnative, Eurasian water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), eight native species of Myriophyllum are found in eastern North America. Consult a botanist to confirm identification before initiating any control measures. Habitat <b>Parrot’s</b> <b>feather</b> is a native of the Amazon River and was introduced to North America in the Washington, D. C., area around 1890. However, since its introduction, the plant has spread throughout the southern United States and northward along both coasts. It appears to prefer warmer, milder climates and has spread quickly via plant fragments through waterways and drainage systems and intentional plantings. Threats Because of its appearance and ease of cultivation, <b>parrot’s</b> <b>feather</b> has been used extensively in both indoor and outdoor aquaria and as a popular water garden plant. It has escaped cultivation, however, and while <b>parrot’s</b> <b>feather</b> may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change the physical characteristics of lakes and streams. The shade from dense infestations can alter aquatic ecosystems, and the thick growth can clog irrigation and drainage canals. Many municipalities are spending {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} annually to control <b>parrot’s</b> <b>feather.</b> Flooding, drainage and irrigation problems, and increased mosquito populations are all legacies of this single aquatic plant. Yet it continues to be a challenge to persuade garden centers to remove it from their inventories...|$|R

50|$|<b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> is {{native to}} the Amazon River in South America, but it can now be found on every {{continent}} except Antarctica. It is thought that this plant was introduced to North America around the late 1800s. It was first discovered in the United States in the 1890s in Washington D.C. Parrot’s feather typically grows in freshwater streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, and canals that have a high nutrient content. During the 20th century it colonized areas in South Africa, Japan, England, New Zealand, and Australia. As it prefers a warmer climate, it is chiefly found in the southern parts of the United States.|$|E

40|$|Feather {{damaging}} behaviour in <b>parrots</b> and <b>feather</b> pecking in {{laying hens}} are behavioural disorders that may share an analogous background. In laying hens, a correlation {{has been found}} between the degree of feather pecking {{and the type of}} coping strategy a bird displays. Individuals from a high feather pecking line usually display a pro-active coping strategy (i. e. hawk-type), whereas birds from a low feather pecking line usually display a reactive coping strategy (i. e. dove-type). Dependent on the type of coping strategy, birds may show a different response when confronted with stressing stimuli during a behavioural test. In parrots, the association between type of coping strategy and feather damaging behaviour may also be present. To test this hypothesis, three behavioural tests (manual restraint test, novel object test and the open field test) were performed in a group of 22 grey parrots with and without feather damaging behaviour. In the open field test was found that <b>parrots</b> without <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour showed lower open field activity then <b>parrots</b> with <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour, which is in accordance to findings in laying hens. With the manual restraint test we didn't find any significant outcomes in our data. However, it did appear that <b>parrots</b> with <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour struggled less, but more powerful, whereas <b>parrots</b> without <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour struggled more constant during the 5 -minute test. The results of the novel object test indicate that <b>parrots</b> with <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour show a lower degree of neophobia than <b>parrots</b> without <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour. Based on two out of three behavioural tests that were conducted, it can be concluded that an analogy is present in laying hens and parrots concerning the association between type of coping strategy and presence of behavioural disorder. Similar to feather pecking laying hens, <b>parrots</b> with <b>feather</b> damaging behaviour also display a pro-active coping strategy...|$|R

50|$|The {{best way}} to {{identify}} whorled water milfoil (M. verticillatum) is by looking at its {{two different types of}} leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1 cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September whorled water milfoil produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits. Another way to distinguish whorled water milfoil is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This milfoil is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of water milfoil that lack turions such as Eurasian water milfoil, <b>parrot</b> <b>feather,</b> hybrid water milfoil, and low water milfoil. The turions of this milfoil look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced {{at the tip of the}} plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the whorled water milfoil form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100 inches long.|$|E
30|$|<b>Parrot</b> <b>feather</b> (Myriophyllum aquaticum) is an amphibious {{macrophyte}} with an inducible heterophylly.

40|$|The {{brilliant}} red, {{orange and}} yellow colours of <b>parrot</b> <b>feathers</b> {{are the product}} of psittacofulvins, which are synthetic pigments known only from parrots. Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful <b>parrot</b> <b>feathers</b> to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers. These differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the Psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation, in addition to their role in communication and camouflage...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{nature of}} the red pigment of Corallium Rubrum (CR) {{has not yet been}} clearly identified. We have recorded the Raman spectra of CR, canthaxantin and <b>parrot</b> <b>feather</b> and we propose an interpretation with the help of quantum chemistry and of the Effective Conjugation Coordinate (ECC) theory which accounts for the main Raman lines (ν 1, ν 2, ν 3) as originating from the polyene backbone. In this study two additional lines in the 1000 cm- 1 range (ν 4 and ν 5) are considered as well as a series of overtones and combination in the second order Raman spectrum (2000 - 3000 cm- 1). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that moving with successive methylation from a simple unsubstituted polyene chain with 9 C=C bonds (as psyttacofulvins) to a 9, 9 ’, 13, 13 ’ tetra methylated chain (as carotenoids) the geometric structures of the molecules and their Raman spectra show a trend which can be rationalized if the ECC theory is extended in order to account for mechanical confinement. This {{turns out to be a}} new concept which helps the interpretation of the Raman spectra of partially methylated conjugated oligoenes. Evidence is found that the main component of the pigment of CR does not posess a fully demethylated polyene chain (psyttacofulfine) nor a tetra-methylated chain (carotenoid), thus indicating that the polyene chain is partially methylated. Since we consider resonance Raman spectra, the target of this study is the structure of the polyene backbone; no direct spectroscopic information can be obtained in this way on the chemical {{nature of the}} groups attached to both chain ends...|$|E
