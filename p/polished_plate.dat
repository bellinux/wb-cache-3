The displacement and stress distributions {{of the high}} speed rotation <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> have been investigated due to centrifugal forces, and the polishing mechanism of super-high polishing has been analyzed by using X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. The {{results showed that the}} displacements both in axial and radial increase with the increasing of the rotational speed. When the rotation speed reached to 1200 rad/s, the von Mises equivalent stress is about 242 MPa, which is safe for the composite <b>polishing</b> <b>plate.</b> Additional, the <b>polishing</b> mechanism is mainly the chemical reaction between carbon and titanium during the super-high speed polishing.

Though thus {{uncertain}} in its action, {{and though}} often diminishing the power {{given to the}} plates at the positive pole of the pile (584.), still {{it is evident that}} heat can render platina active, which before was inert (595.). The cause of its occasional failure appears to be due {{to the surface of the}} metal becoming soiled, either from something previously adhering to it, which is made to adhere more closely by the action of the heat, or from matter communicated from the flame of the lamp, or from the air itself. It often happens that a <b>polished</b> <b>plate</b> of platina, when heated by the spirit-lamp and a blowpipe, becomes dulled and clouded on its surface by something either formed or deposited there; and this, and much less than this, is sufficient to prevent it from exhibiting the curious power now under consideration (634. 636.). Platina also has been said to combine with carbon; and it is not at all unlikely that in processes of heating, where carbon or its compounds are present, a film of such a compound may be thus formed, and thus prevent the exhibition of the properties belonging to pure platina[A].|$|E
6000|$|I professed every willingness, and {{for five}} minutes I listened, {{but it would be}} too much to say that I understood. I don't even now, but it is not important. My vision was of other matters than those they put before me, and while they desired there should be no mistake about their {{ancestors}} I became more and more lucid about themselves. I got away as soon as possible, and walked home through the great dusky, empty London--the best of all conditions for thought. By the time I reached my door my little article was practically composed-- ready to be transferred on the morrow from the <b>polished</b> <b>plate</b> of fancy. I believe it attracted some notice, was thought [...] "graceful" [...] and was said to be by some one else. I had to be pointed without being lively, and it took some tact.

What pot-bellied East Indiaman brought the [...] "virtuous maid" [...] up the river, and did Lucia [...] "make her bargain" [...] as the cant of those times went, on the first, second, or third day after her arrival? Or did she, with the others of the batch, give a spinsters' ball as a last trial--following the custom of the country? No. She was a fair Kentish maiden, sent out, at a cost of five hundred pounds, English money, under the captain's charge, to wed the man of her choice, and he knew Clive well, had had dealings with Omichand, and talked to men who had lived through the terrible night in the Black Hole. He was a rich man, Lucia's battered tomb proves it, and he gave Lucia all that her heart could wish: a green-painted boat to take the air in on the river of evenings. Coffree slave-boys who could play on the French horn, and even a very elegant, neat coach with a genteel rutlan roof ornamented with flowers very highly finished, ten best <b>polished</b> <b>plate</b> glasses, ornamented with a few elegant medallions enriched with mother-o'-pearl, that she might take her drive on the course as befitted a factor's wife. All these things he gave her. And when the convoys came up the river, and the guns thundered, and the servants of the Honourable the East India Company drank to the king's health, be sure that Lucia before all the other ladies in the Fort had her choice of the new stuffs from England and was cordially hated in consequence. Tilly Kettle painted her picture a little before she died, and the hot-blooded young writers did duel with small swords in the fort ditch for the honour of piloting her through a minuet at the Calcutta theatre or the Punch House. But Warren Hastings danced with her instead, and the writers were confounded--every man of them. She was a toast far up the river. And she walked in the evening on the bastions of Fort William, and said, [...] "La! I protest!" [...] It was there that she exchanged congratulations with all her friends on the 20th of October, when those who were alive gathered together to felicitate themselves on having come through another hot season; and the men--even the sober factor saw no wrong here--got most royally and Britishly drunk on Madeira that had twice rounded the Cape. But Lucia fell sick, and the doctor--he who went home after seven years with five lakhs and a half, and a corner of this vast graveyard to his account--said that it was a pukka or putrid fever, and the system required strengthening. So they fed Lucia on hot curries, and mulled wine worked up with spirits and fortified with spices, for nearly a week; {{at the end of which}} time she closed her eyes on the weary river and the Fort for ever, and a gallant, with a turn for belles-lettres, wept openly as men did then and had no shame of it, and composed the verses above set, and thought himself a neat hand at the pen--stap his vitals! But the factor was so grieved that he could write nothing at all--could only spend his money--and he counted his wealth by lakhs--on a sumptuous grave.

6000|$|A {{good deal}} of the rest of Ida's visit was devoted to explaining, as it were, so {{extraordinary}} a statement. This explanation was more copious than any she had yet indulged in, and as the summer twilight gathered and she kept her child in the garden she was conciliatory to a degree that let her need to arrange things a little perceptibly peep out. It was not merely that she explained; she almost conversed; all that was wanting was that she should have positively chattered a little less. It was really the occasion of Maisie's life on which her mother was to have most to say to her. That alone was an implication of generosity and virtue, and no great stretch was required to make our young lady feel that she should best meet her and soonest have it over by simply seeming struck with the propriety of her contention. They sat together while the parent's gloved hand sometimes rested sociably on the child's and sometimes gave a corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a tress too thick; and Maisie was conscious of the effort to keep out of her eyes the wonder with which they were occasionally moved to blink. Oh there would have been things to blink at if one had let one's self go; and it was lucky they were alone together, without Sir Claude or Mrs. Wix or even Mrs. Beale to catch an imprudent glance. Though profuse and prolonged her ladyship was not exhaustively lucid, and her account of her situation, so far as it could be called descriptive, was a muddle of inconsequent things, bruised fruit of an occasion she had rather too lightly affronted. None of them were really thought out and some were even not wholly insincere. It was as if she had asked outright what better proof could have been wanted of her goodness and her greatness than just this marvellous consent to give up what she had so cherished. It was as if she had said in so many words: [...] "There have been things between us--between Sir Claude and me--which I needn't go into, you little nuisance, because you wouldn't understand them." [...] It suited her to convey that Maisie had been kept, so far as SHE was concerned or could imagine, in a holy ignorance and that she must take for granted a supreme simplicity. She turned this way and that in the predicament she had sought and from which she could neither retreat with grace nor emerge with credit: she draped herself in the tatters of her impudence, postured to her utmost before the last little triangle of cracked glass to which so many fractures had reduced the <b>polished</b> <b>plate</b> of filial superstition. If neither Sir Claude nor Mrs. Wix was there this was perhaps all the more a pity: the scene had a style of its own that would have qualified it for presentation, especially at such a moment as that of her letting it betray that she quite did think her wretched offspring better placed with Sir Claude than in her own soiled hands. There was at any rate nothing scant either in her admissions or her perversions, the mixture of her fear of what Maisie might undiscoverably think and of the support she at the same time gathered from a necessity of selfishness and a habit of brutality. This habit flushed through the merit she now made, in terms explicit, of not having come to Folkestone to kick up a vulgar row. She had not come to box any ears or to bang any doors or even to use any language: she had come at the worst to lose the thread of her argument in an occasional dumb disgusted twitch of the toggery in which Mrs. Beale's low domestic had had the impudence to serve up Miss Farange. She checked all criticism, not committing herself even so far as for those missing comforts of the schoolroom on which Mrs. Wix had presumed.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a physical model for polishing. It {{makes it possible}} to determine physico-chemical processes occurring at contactless chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) of crystal surfaces. A balance equation for diffusion, convection and chemical flows is used to describe processes that are proceeding in the stationary case. The analytical expressions are obtained that relate polishing rate and surface form for processed material to the physical parameters of the proceeding processes. It was found that macrorelief of the processed surface depends not only on the velocity of <b>polishing</b> <b>plate</b> motion but also on the gap between the processed wafer and <b>polishing</b> <b>plate,</b> as well as active component diffusion in the etching solution. One would expect that, at processing conditions discussed, the surface form is the same for different materials, whatever the active component concentration and chemical reaction constant. The polishing rate substantially depends on the concentration of the etchant active component, chemical reaction, physical properties of sample material and etching liquid. It is shown that the inverse rate of dissolution is the sum of inverse limiting rates of chemical, diffusion and convection stages of the process. The expressions are obtained that make it possible to optimize technological modes of polishing...|$|R
