5000|$|Hudson {{introduced}} spirit photography to Britain in 1872. He varied {{his methods}} through the years. Though frequently caught practicing deception, {{he was never}} arrested. Hudson at one time used a trick camera, made by a craftsman who sold conjuring apparatus. Harry Price described how the camera worked in his book, Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter, published in London in 1936. When the <b>plate</b> <b>slide</b> was inserted, this action brought the paper positive of the [...] "ghost" [...] up against the sensitive plate. When the shutter bulb was pressed, this image and {{the picture of the}} sitter were captured on the plate. Thus a single exposure on this plate carried both images.|$|E
50|$|Carbonized papyri are papyri {{that have}} been charred. There {{seems to be one}} method for {{restoring}} charred papyri. The first step of this method is to carefully separate the layers of the papyrus since they cannot be unrolled due to their condition. This separation is done with either a thin palette knife or a scraper and lifting them with tweezers. Sometimes, dampening the layers is done to speed up the process of separation. In the event that the pieces are very fragile, Japanese paper is used to loosen and lift the layers, but only if the back of the papyrus does not contain any writing. Another method is to use a dilution of water and glue to fix the layers from the back. After separating the layers one by one, the pieces in the individual layer are placed together according to the writing {{on the front of the}} papyrus. Then the layer is turned over in order to stabilize it from the back, which can be only achieved if the back of the papyrus is does not have any writings. If this is the case, then the pieces cannot be consolidated, unless they are between the inscribed lines. However, this latter process is done only sometimes and with extreme care. A great method of reconstructing a layer of carbonized papyri is to use Japanese Tissue paper and a sheet of glass, on which to place the layer. Then a layer of wax paper or plastic paper is placed over the whole reconstruction and then cover that with a glass plate. This step is done to ease the process of turning the papyrus layers over. Through the use of a thin paintbrush and letting the glass <b>plate</b> <b>slide</b> step-by-step, the carbonized layer is strengthened by carefully applying the diluted adhesive through the Japaneses paper from the back. To avoid air bubbles, the whole back must be glued. It is also important not to let the adhesive seep into the papyrus since this will form a reflective surface on the front of the papyrus, which will render the ink on the front of the papyrus invisible. The reinforced papyrus can be turned over by grasping the Japanese paper.|$|E
