40|$|Enterprise {{customers}} are increasingly adopting MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) VPN (Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network)</b> <b>service</b> that offers direct any-to-any reachability among the customer sites via a provider network. Unfortunately this direct reachability model makes the service provider’s routing tables grow very {{large as the}} number of VPNs and the number of routes per customer increase. As a result, router memory in the provider’s network has become a key bottleneck in provisioning new customers. This paper proposes Relaying, a scalable VPN routing architecture that the provider can implement simply by modifying the configuration of routers in the provider network, without requiring changes to the router hardware and software. Relaying substantially reduces the memory footprint of VPNs by choosing a small number of hub routers in each VPN that maintain full reachability information, and by allowing nonhu...|$|E

We focus our research {{on the design of}} a minimal cost routing policy to be used by network-based IP VPN. The interest in such solutions is generated by both customers seeking to reduce support costs and by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking new revenue sources. Reducing the cost of operation would allow ISPs to define and deploy new VPN services. In particular, a Multi-commodity Min-Cost Flows (MMCF) formulation is applied to the resource allocation in network-based IP VPN in order to develop a cost-effective routing proposal. We compare our proposal with the IETF RFC 2676 enhancement: a QoS enhancement to the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) algorithm. Our results show the benefits of our proposal by considering two different scenarios. 1...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a service-oriented architecture for interdomain service provisioning in optical networks. The architecture introduces a service layer that concentrates all the interactions among domains necessary for service provisioning. A service layer {{is an alternative}} to the GMPLS (Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching) architecture, but without a rigid control plane as found in GMPLS. We start by defining a set of basic services to provide single end-to-end (e 2 e) interdomain connections. Then, more sophisticated services are created through the composition of these basic services. The interdomain Optical VPN (Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network)</b> <b>service</b> is considered in order to illustrate the composition of services. A prototype of the architecture was designed and implemented using Web services as the main technology. The architecture was evaluated in terms of speed, scalability, and bandwidth consumption necessary to establish e 2 e interdomain connections and Optical VPNs...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Virtual private {{networks}} have provided customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. Approach: The COVPA, the provisioning algorithm for a Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> <b>service,</b> which built and managed VPNs on demand. Results: The COVPA allowed each VPN to have guaranteed resources and customized control and supported a highly dynamic VPN service where creation and modification operations {{took place on}} fast timescales at reduced cost. Also, it allowed the sharing of bandwidth on the links to reduce the cost. A design process is described, that attempts to satisfy the goals of both the customer and the VPN Service Provider (VSP). Conclusion/Recommendations: The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, asymmetric ratio and rejection ratio with the breadth first search, steiner tree and primal dual algorithms. With the enhancement on the design process, the COVPA performs better than the breadth first search, steiner tree and primal dual algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The hose {{resource}} provisioning model {{promises to}} provide an easy–to–use characterization framework for Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> <b>service</b> offerings. Significant research effort has recently been spent on proposing new algorithms for provisioning cost–optimal networks specified according to this new model. However, a detailed comparison of the bandwidth requirement for networks designed based on the hose model and networks designed based on the traditional pipe model has not been performed. The first contribution {{of this paper is}} a detailed comparison of the bandwidth needs of the two models assuming a range of network sizes and network topologies. This numerical evaluation required efficient calculation methods for determining resource allocation based on the hose model parameters, therefore, a linear programming based formulation is also presented for this purpose. The second contribution is the calculation of a lower bound for the hose based realization. This lower bound is very useful in evaluating the two models given that the problem of provisioning a minimal cost network based on the hose model specification can only approximately be solved in polynomial time.

VPNs that require site-to-site interconnectivity without strong (cryptographic) security can be deployed in a scalable way based on the network-based VPN model, as long as the interaction between the customer and provider routing dynamics are controlled. VPNs that require strong (end-to-end) cryptographic security should be deployed according to the CPE-based VPN model, using the available IPsec protocol suite.
