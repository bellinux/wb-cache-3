40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} and rank {{the performance of}} 65 Canadian Equity <b>Pooled</b> <b>Funds.</b> We adopt traditional performance measures to evaluate <b>pooled</b> <b>fund</b> managers’ performances from January 1999 to December 2008. We employ the geometric mean as a reward measure, standard deviation and beta coefficient as risk measures, and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) risk-adjusted measures that include Jensen’s (1968) alpha, the Treynor (1965) ratio, the Sharpe (1966) ratio, and Modigliani and Modigliani’s (1997) M-Squared. Treynor-Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson-Merton (1981) are used to measure market-timing. According to our results, thirty-five percent of 65 Canadian Equity <b>Pooled</b> <b>Funds</b> managers have abnormal returns in terms of Jensen’s (1968) alpha.

40|$|ABSTRACT In the USA, {{civilian}} meteorological organizations traditionally controlled weather services during peacetime, and {{the military}} controlled them during wartime. However, after World War II, the military retained control of meteorological research funding. Academics pursued theoretical issues, and the US Weather Bureau concentrated on improving forecasts. Post-war advances in electronic computing encouraged these groups to <b>pool</b> <b>funding,</b> theoretical knowledge, and forecasting skills, to develop numerical weather prediction techniques that would radically change 20 th-century meteorology. The Institute for Advanced Study’s Meteorology Project illustrates how research is negotiated across intra-disciplinary boundaries, in relation to Cold War era themes of international scientific exchange, the integration of practice with theory, the role of research schools, and the tension between military and civilian control of science. The present paper also raises a significant epistemological issue characteristic of 20 th-century science: who possesses the better scientific understanding – those who crunch numbers, or those for whom observational data hold meaning...|$|E
40|$|People {{in crisis}} often require {{multiple}} community services. A homeless person may need medical {{health care and}} behavioral health care, along with shelter. A woman who {{is the victim of}} domestic abuse may need help with childcare, transportation, food, and emergency housing. Comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs) attempt to provide this interrelated range of community services. CCIs developed as a part of community building efforts in the late 1980 ’s (Kubisch, 1996; Stagner and Duran, 1997). “Comprehensive” can either refer to an initiative that incorporates social, educational, cultural, physical, and economic development in a community or to an initiative whose purpose is to coordinate a system of services, rather than offer isolated services (Kubisch; Parachini and Covington, 2001; Stagner and Duran). The “community” involved in a CCI may be a neighborhood, city, or county. The goal of some initiatives is to build a strong community by developing local capacity that will be effective in dealing with problems the community may face in the future (Kubisch, 1996). Other initiatives aim to <b>pool</b> <b>funding</b> from separate programs (O’Brien, 1997) and coordinate social services across programs to make them more available to all people in need (Stagner and Duran, 1997) ...|$|E

40|$|Civil Society Support Funds (CSSFs) are {{becoming}} a common mechanism for providing financial support and capacity building to Civil Society groups {{in most parts of}} the world. Management of these funds have become a challenge to the donors with options either to channel it through intermediaries or present it themselves. Multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches were adopted and supported largely with other participatory methodologies that combine social, institutional, political and economic parameters in the information collection, collation, analysis and synthesis, and for reporting. It was found out that an independent funding scheme earmarked for the Environmental Natural Resources (ENR) sector is a preferred funding mechanism for the sector. The name ‘Civil Society – Natural Resource and Environmental Fund’ was recommended. This scheme is perceived to be independent of any existing scheme or institution and presents a mechanism for specific targeting of ENR issues and addresses variations in CS capacities. It was concluded that the use of intermediaries for the management of donor <b>pool</b> <b>funding</b> is an effective way of finding balance between the two horns of a dilemma – the DPs or Government donor funds meant for the development of the CS capacity for accountability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} rise of 'urban science' {{in the context of}} {{contemporary}} discourses of strategic urban management. 'Urban science' – developing precincts to stimulate knowledge-based development – is founded on an assumption that the positive-sum nature of projects means that all partners share a common set of interests in the projects, and that these interests are around promoting knowledge-based urban development (KBUD). This paper explores this simplification in order to develop a more robust understanding of the role of knowledge-based urban development processes and discourses in contemporary urban governance. Through a reflection on a notionally successful case study from the east of the Netherlands, the paper explores how one particular urban science project {{led to the development of}} strategic urban capacity; partners were able to agree to <b>pool</b> <b>funding</b> towards collective regional economic development policy in a way that had not been possible a decade previously. The paper explores the way the urban science project held these diverse interests together, and highlights that much of urban science as a set of practices is embedded as much in traditional modes of territorial development as in attempts to stimulate KBUD. The paper finishes with an argument that more systematic consideration of the relation of KBUD discourses to more traditional territorial development processes is necessary for proper examination of these emerging economic development discourses and paradigms...|$|E
40|$|The City Strategy (CS) {{concept was}} first {{announced}} in the 2006 Welfare Reform Green Paper – A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work. CS was designed {{at a time of}} growth in the national economy to combat enduring pockets of entrenched worklessness and poverty in urban areas by empowering local institutions to come together in partnerships to develop locally sensitive solutions. It was premised on the idea that developing {{a better understanding of the}} local welfare to work arena would allow partnerships to align and <b>pool</b> <b>funding</b> and resources to reduce duplication of services and fill gaps in provision. The ‘theory of change’ underlying CS suggested that such an approach would result in more coordinated services which would be able to generate extra positive outcomes in terms of getting people into jobs and sustaining them in employment over and above existing provision. CS was initially set to run for two years from April 2007 to March 2009 in 15 CS Pathfinder (CSP) areas, varying in size from five wards in one town through single local authority areas to subregional groupings of multiple local authority areas, across Great Britain. In July 2008, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced an extension for a further two years to March 2011. In April 2009, two local areas in Wales, which were in receipt of monies from the Deprived Areas Fund (DAF), were invited by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to form local partnerships with a similar remit to the CSPs, albeit more limited in scope – to develop locally sensitive solutions to economic inactivity, to the CSPs. During the period that the CS initiative was operational, economic conditions changed markedly with a severe recession, followed by fragile recovery. The CSPs had to cope with ongoing changes in policy throughout the lifetime of the CS initiative, including a General Election and a new Coalition Government at Westminster early in the fourth year. While policy changes are a fact of life for local practitioners operating in the welfare to work arena, the global recession in 2008 / 09 marked a fundamental change in the context in which local partnerships operated...|$|E
