50|$|There are {{a number}} of lizards ranging in size from just over an inch or two in length to the huge 6 ft long green iguana (Iguana iguana). The {{so-called}} luminous lizard (Riama shrevei) makes its home in <b>primary</b> <b>lower</b> montane and montane forest at the mouths of caves and cool stream banks on the high peaks, ridges and high valleys of the Northern Range of Trinidad and is found nowhere else on earth. Found in forest, forest edge and savanna habitats, the large tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) or matte/salipenta as it is locally called and the green iguana (still fairly common, even in some sub-urban areas) are considered delicacies on both Trinidad and Tobago. A number of anole species (Anolis) may be easily observed, even in suburban areas. Only Anolis chrysolepis is a Trinidad native, with all other anoles being relatively recently or historically introduced. Other common lizards include macro-teiids (or whip-tailed lizards) such as the Ameiva atrigularis (locally called the zandolie or ground lizard and common even in suburban gardens) and Cnemidophorus lemniscatus (most readily seen along some coastal areas of southwestern Tobago and on Trinidad's east and south coasts and on the islands of Chacachacare, Huevos, Little Tobago and Goat Island). Nocturnally active geckos of the genera Thecadactylus and Hemidactylus are common in old and rural buildings on both islands and are commonly referred to as mabouias and wood slaves respectively. There {{are a number}} of small colourful diurnal geckos of the genus Gonatodes present. One of them, Gonatodes ocellatus is endemic to forests and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago while another, Gonatodes vittatus or the streak lizard as it is locally known, is very common and can be seen in most suburban and even urban backyards in Trinidad (and is probably relatively recently introduced to some parts Tobago associated with human occupation). The tiny Mole's gecko Sphaerodactylus molei is found on both islands and is among the smallest of lizards in the world.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyse the {{performance}} of non-contrast MR lymphography for the classification of <b>primary</b> <b>lower</b> limb lymphoedema in 121 consecutive patients with 187 <b>primary</b> <b>lower</b> limb lymphoedemas. Materials and methods: 121 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed <b>primary</b> <b>lower</b> limb lymphoedema underwent non-contrast MR lymphography with a free-breathing 3 D fast spin-echo sequence with a very long TR/TE (4000 / 884 ms). MR examinations were retrospectively reviewed for severity of lymphoedema (absent, mild, moderate, severe) and characteristics of inguinal lymph nodes and iliac and inguinal lymphatic trunks graded as aplasic (no lymph nodes or lymphatic trunks), hypoplasic (less lymph nodes or lymphatic trunks), normal and hyperplasic (more lymph nodes or more and/or dilated trunks). Results: There was an excellent correlation between clinical stage and severity of lymphoedema (Cramer’s V of 0, 73 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001)). Differentiation was feasible between inguinal lymphatic vessel aplasia (21 %), hypoplasia (15 %), normal pattern (53 %) and hyperplasia (11 %). Severe lymphoedema was observed in 46 % of aplasic patterns and in 37 % of hyperplasic patterns, but in only 15 % of hypoplasic patterns and never observed in normal patterns (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusion: Non-contrast MR lymphography is able to classify <b>primary</b> <b>lower</b> limb lymphoedemas into hyperplasic, aplasic, hypoplasic and normal patterns...|$|E
