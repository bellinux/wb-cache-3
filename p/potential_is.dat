5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> allowed.|$|E

5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a duality symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change, and a term known as the twist <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> analogous to the aforementioned duality between E and B.|$|E
5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E

By 1 year of age nine of the 10 infants with absent brainstem auditory evoked <b>potentials</b> <b>were</b> shown to have sensory neural hearing loss and required hearing aids: the remaining infant had secretory otitis media. None of the 107 infants whose auditory evoked <b>potentials</b> <b>were</b> present {{were found to have}} sensory neural hearing loss but 13 had secretory otitis media. Measurement of brainstem auditory evoked <b>potentials</b> <b>is</b> an accurate method of identifying sensory neural hearing loss in very preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|Relations between {{parameters}} of the nucleon-nucleon triplet-even potentials consistent with the n-p data are investigated. Strength of a triplet-even spin-orbit <b>potential</b> cannot <b>be</b> determined without close reference {{to the strength of}} a triplet-even quadratic spin-orbit potential. For a strong quadratic spin-orbit potential, strong positive spin-orbit <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> allowable. For a weak quadratic spin-orbit potential, tail-part of spin-orbit <b>potentials</b> should <b>be</b> negative and positive inner part is favoured by the deuteron magnetic moment. Central <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> strongly attractive inside and tensor <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> weaker than the OPEP.

5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

5|$|Electric <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> a scalar quantity, that is, it {{has only}} {{magnitude}} and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this {{electron}} {{transport system}} use the energy {{released from the}} oxidation of NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The energy stored in this <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, {{with the exception of}} anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome.|$|E

40|$|Field <b>potentials</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} from intracranial electrodes {{in humans}} {{to study the}} role of the anterior medial temporal lobe (AMTL) in language-related processing. Subjects viewed lists of words in which orthography and word type varied, or in which words were primed by semantic associates. Large negative field <b>potentials</b> <b>were</b> elicited within the AMTL by isolated words. The amplitude and intracranial distribution of these AMTL field <b>potentials</b> <b>were</b> consistent with those in our previous study in which anomalous sentence-ending words were used as stimuli (McCarthy et al., in press). The neocortex, in the region of the collateral sulcus and anterior fusiform gyrus, was identified as the likely neural generator of this field potential. The AMTL field <b>potential</b> <b>was</b> diminished by semantic priming, and was larger for words with semantic content than for words serving grammatical function. Orthographically illegal nonwords did not elicit this field potential. The N 400 scalp event-related <b>potential</b> (ERP) has <b>been</b> shown to respond in the same manner to these task manipulations (Nobre and McCarthy, 1994), and, thus, the AMTL field <b>potential</b> <b>was</b> proposed to contribute to the generation of N 400.

5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
