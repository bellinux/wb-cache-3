40|$|Copyright © 2007 P. MickanLearning {{at school}} is a complex <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{socialisation}} into selected and valued practices of a society. As children and students progress through levels of education, they are instructed in increasingly specialised cultural practices defined in the curriculum as subjects. This paper describes subject-specific teachers working with non-English-speaking immigrant students in a secondary school in South Australia. It examines teachers' subject discourses as opportunities for students' apprenticeship into the practices of two secondary school curriculum subjects, science and home economics. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the way teachers' practices and discourses constructed specific cultural domains of the school curriculum for immigrant students. In class, students experienced language in context, which served the social purposes of their community of practice. Teachers and students carried out practices of science and home economics with distinctive spoken and written discourses, which were linked with material and behavioural semiotic resources in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b> The study proposes that through their involvement in the social practices of content subjects, newcomers experience and are apprenticed into selected discourses for cultural participation in education. The study suggests that for new arrivals or immigrants, the curriculum experiences are engagements with cultural practices, which constitute part of their socialisation into new cultural contexts...|$|R

40|$|Instructional {{designers}} {{are expected to}} be familiar with the epistemological underpinnings of several theories and their consequences on the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b> Constructivism is the dominant theory of the last decade and supports construction of knowledge by the individual. This paper discusses the basic principles underlying constructivism, particularly active, collaborative and authentic learning. Application of these principles on the process- analysis, development, evaluation- of instructional design poses certain challenges with regards to issues such as pre-specification of knowledge, authentic evaluation and learner control. Most of the problems are attributed to the fact that constructivism is a learning theory and not an instructional-design theory. Therefore, instructional designers must attempt to translate constructivism into instructional design through a more pragmatic approach that focuses on the principles of moderate- rather than extreme- constructivism and makes use of emergent technology tools. This shift could facilitate the development of more situated, experiential, meaningful and cost-effective learning environments...|$|E
40|$|In {{teaching}} language arts, {{the modes}} of language such as reading, writing, speaking, and listening are often not taught as integrated modes.

Some teachers are using more trade books instead of or with the traditional basal.
