40|$|In {{this paper}} {{preliminary}} results of investigations on the stratigraphic succession of the <b>Permian</b> Mulargia <b>Lake</b> <b>basin</b> are here described. This succession, from 350 to 400 m thick, has been first time subdivided into 4 stratigraphic units, and respectively, from the bottom: a “Lower siliciclastic Unit”, a “Volcano-sedimentary Unit”, an “Upper siliciclastic Unit”, and a “Volcanic Unit”. The depositional frame of this succession is inferred as {{a network of}} alluvial facies of various energy degrees, comprised between the palustrine, the fluvial and the lacustrine environments. These facies are located into a continental molassic basin, progressively spreading out during the post-collisional extensional Variscan tectonic phase, and characterized, during its evolution, by two different volcanic activity cycles...|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{satellite}} imagery {{can be used for}} a census of the thousands of <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> which commonly exist in semi-arid areas, and which sporadically contain water at various times of the year. Storm paths and runoff collected by such <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> can also be closely monitored, the accuracy dependent on periodicity of the orbits {{and the size of the}} basins. Study of the relationships between spectral differences (obtained from ERTS- 1 imagery) and the water balance ecosystem of the <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> is in a preliminary stage. However, examination of ERTS- 1 MSS frames show that Band 4 has the poorest tonal contrast in semi-arid West Texas, Band 5 is best for definition of vegetation, Band 6 is best for defining larger water areas, and Band 7 is best for counting small <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> with water. Ground-truth studies reveal significant differences between test sites, the relative importance of which will be reflected by the hydrologic balance of each <b>lake</b> <b>basin...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{reconstruct}} postglacial lake-level history {{within the}} <b>Lake</b> Michigan <b>basin</b> using soil stratigraphy, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), sedimentology and 14 C {{data from the}} Silver <b>Lake</b> <b>basin,</b> which lies adjacent to Lake Michigan. Stratigraphy in nine vibracores recovered {{from the floor of}} Silver Lake appears to reflect fluctu-ation of water levels in the <b>Lake</b> Michigan <b>basin.</b> Aeolian activity within the study area from 3, 000 years (cal yr. B. P.) to the present was in-ferred from analysis of buried soils, an aerial photograph sequence, and GPR. Sediments in and around Silver Lake appear to contain a pa-leoenvironmental record that spans the entire post-glacial history of the <b>Lake</b> Michigan <b>basin.</b> We suggest that (1) a pre-Nipissing rather than a Nipissing barrier separated Silver <b>Lake</b> <b>basin</b> from the <b>Lake</b> Michigan <b>basin,</b> (2) that the Ni-pissing transgression elevated the water table in the Silver <b>Lake</b> <b>basin</b> about 6, 500 cal yr.

The <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> system is modeled as quenched disorder. In this model we show that once the pathogen arrives at the <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> it spreads from one lake to another, eventually spreading to the entire <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> system in a wave like pattern. The extinction time {{has been found to}} depend on the steady state host population and pathogen growth rate. Linear estimate of the extinction time is computed. The steady state host population shows a threshold behavior in the interaction strength for a given growth rate.

The study focused on the Malawian side of the lake. Interviews, field observations and review of existing lake management and indicator development approaches around the world were the methods employed. It was found that Malawi lacks focus on lakes in its strategies and the existing management of the lake is on a sector-to-sector basis with little coordination. Furthermore, the capacity of lake-related sector institutions is hampered by inadequate resources and unstable flow of funds. It was concluded that the current management of the <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> is unsustainable and there is need to comprehensively monitor the <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> as well as formulate and implement management plans and strategies that are based on the knowledge obtained from targeted monitoring.

40|$|Governance is {{essential}} to <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> management, {{but it is the}} most challenged and needs increased attention. <b>Lake</b> <b>Basin</b> Governance performance assessment is designed to measure the progress and impacts of policies, institutions and the roles of various actors in ensuring sustainability. It measures the performance of technical/operational, social/networks, and institutional arrangement that make up the socio-ecological system. Governance performance assessment becomes very necessary with over-emphasis of institutions on resources utilization and exploitation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a governance performance assessment framework specifically for <b>lake</b> <b>basins.</b> The Adaptive Integrated <b>Lake</b> <b>Basin</b> Management (AILBM) framework is a diagnostic and prescriptive performance assessment tool with an outcome to produce an adaptive and integrative system with equity, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability and flexibility to problem-solving and resilience.

40|$|Executive summary Increasing {{exploitation}} of natural resources, inappropriate land-use practices, and uncoordinated sectoral policies and development activities in <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> impair the various important functions of lakes throughout the world. New and innovative {{approaches to the}} management of <b>lakes</b> and their <b>basins</b> are urgently needed to ensure that these precious freshwater ecosystems continue to deliver their services. Stakeholder participation {{lies at the heart}} of the new policy approaches to management of lakes and reservoirs. The stakeholders in <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> management are individuals or representatives of a group who make use of, have an impact on, or are impacted by the issue of concern. Experience from case studies on 28 lake regions from throughout the world shows that local communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are among those stakeholders that can significantly affect the outcome of management efforts in <b>lake</b> <b>basins.</b> The case studies clearly demonstrate that active community participation is vital to sustainable development in <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> management. Effective participation of local communities in <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> management depends on the degree of awareness among local communities of the important technical and social considerations. This is why the involvement of local communitie...|$|R

The two <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> share a common {{evolutionary}} history and have similar native fish faunas (Graham 1929, Worthington 1929). The two main lakes have also had similar impacts by introduction of Nile perch Lates niloticus and therefore these two lakes can {{be considered to be}} similar for ichiogeographical purposes.
