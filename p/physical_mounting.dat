The system uses three quartz resonators of different crystallographic cuts (AT cut, BT cut and SC cut) in the same environment. The development of an algorithm to solve a system of equations representing a complete representation of the temperature characteristics of the three resonators is presented. This is followed by {{an analysis of the}} potential accuracy of the system and the limitations imposed by the assumptions made in the mathematical models of the system. Sputtering yields were verified using Rutherford backscattering analysis. Experimental apparatus including the <b>physical</b> <b>mounting</b> of the resonators in an experimental environment, details of the oscillator circuitry and frequency counter, and use of a personal computer for data acquisition and control are described.

An experiment using beams of Sb+ at 50 keV and Sb 2 + at 100 keV has been used to demonstrate the enhancement of sputtering yield that occurs when Au films are bombarded with monomers and dimers of Sb at the same energy per atom.

40|$|The {{emerging}} technology of large (~ 10, 000 pixel) submillimeter-wave bolometer arrays presents a novel optical design problem [...] -how can such arrays be fed by diffraction-limited telescope optics where {{the primary mirror}} is less than 100, 000 wavelengths in diameter? Standard Cassegrain designs for radiotelescope optics exhibit focal surface curvature so large that detectors cannot be placed more than 25 beam diameters from the central ray. The problem is worse for Ritchey-Cretien designs, because these minimize coma while increasing field curvature. Classical aberrations, including coma, are usually dominated by diffraction in submillimeter-wave single dish telescopes. The telescope designer must consider (1) diffraction, (2) aberration, (3) curvature of field, (4) cross-polarization, (5) internal reflections, (6) the effect of blockages, (7) means of beam chopping on- and off-source, (8) gravitational and thermal deformations of the primary mirror, (9) the <b>physical</b> <b>mounting</b> of large detector packages, and (10) the effect of gravity and (11) vibration on those detectors. Simultaneous optimization of these considerations {{in the case of}} large detector arrays leads to telescopes that differ considerably from standard radiotelescope designs. Offset optics provide flexibility for mounting detectors, while eliminating blockage and internal reflections. Aberrations and cross-polarization can be the same as on-axis designs having the same diameter and focal length. Trade-offs include the complication of primary mirror homology and an increase in overall cost. A dramatic increase in usable field of view can be achieved using shaped optics. Solutions having one to six mirrors will be discussed, including a possible six-mirror design for the proposed South Pole 10 m telescope.

40|$|Signal-conditioning {{amplifier}} recorders (SCAmpRs) {{have been}} proposed {{as a means of}} simplifying and upgrading the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Ground Measurement System (GMS), which is a versatile data-acquisition system that gathers and records a variety of measurement data before and during the launch of a space shuttle. In the present version of the GMS system, signal conditioning amplifiers digitize and transmit data to a VME chassis that multiplexes up to 416 channels. The data is transmitted via a high-speed data bus to a second VME chassis where it is available for snapshots. The data is passed from the second VME chassis to a high-speed data recorder. This process is duplicated for installations at two launch pads and the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). Since any failure of equipment in the data path results in loss of data, much of the system is redundant. The architecture of the existing GMS limits expansion or any modification to the system to meet changing requirements because of the cost and time required. A SCAmpR-based system is much more flexible. The basis of the simplification, flexibility, and reliability is the shifting of the recording function to the individual amplifier channels. Each SCAmpR is a self-contained single channel data acquisition system, which in its current implementation, has a data storage capacity of up to 30 minutes when operating at the fastest data sampling rates. The SCAmpR channels are self-configuring and self-calibrating. Multiple SCAmpR channels are ganged on printed circuit boards and mounted in a chassis that provides power, a network hub, and Inter-Range Instrument Group (IRIG) time signals. The SCAmpR channels share nothing except <b>physical</b> <b>mounting</b> on a circuit board. All circuitry is electrically separate for each channel.

40|$|During {{the course}} of this project, a digital radio {{telemetry}} system has been designed and shown to be capable of measuring parameters from the piston of an internal combustion engine, under load. The impetus for the work stems from the need to sample the appropriate data required for oil degradation analysis and the unavailability of system to perform such sampling. The prototype system was designed for installation within a small Norton Villiers C- 30 industrial engine. This choice of engine presented significant design challenges due to the small size of the engine (components and construction) and the crankcase environment. These challenges were manifest in the choice of carrier frequency, antenna size and location, modulation scheme, data encoding scheme, signal attenuation, error checking and correction, choice of components, manufacturing techniques and <b>physical</b> <b>mounting</b> to reciprocating parts. In order to overcome these challenges detailed analysis of the radio frequency spectrum was undertaken in order to minimise attenuation from mechanisms such as, absorption, reflection, motion, spatial arrangement and noise. Another aspect of the project concerned the development of a flexible modus operandi in order to facilitate a number of sampling regimes. In order to achieve such flexibility a two-way communication protocol was implemented enabling the sampling system to be programmed into a particular mode of operation, while in use. Additionally the system was designed to accommodate the range of signals output from most transducer devices. The sampling capabilities of the prototype system were extended by enabling the system to support multiple transducers providing a mixture of output signals; for example both analogue and digital signals have been sampled. Additionally, a facility to sample data in response to triggering stimuli has been tested; specifically a sampling trigger may be derived from the motion of the piston via an accelerometer. Ancillary components, such as interface hardware and software, have been developed which are suitable for the recording of data accessed by the system. This work has demonstrated that multi-transducer, mixed signal monitoring of piston parameters, (such as temperature, acceleration etc.) using a two-way, programmable, digital radio frequency telemetry system is not only possible but provides a means for more advanced instrumentation...|$|E
