40|$|Information {{is lacking}} on the {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} cardiac and striated muscle injury in late leptospirosis, and {{it is unclear whether}} patients with one type of myositis are at increased risk of developing another. Therefore, 38 patients with severe, late Weil's disease were evaluated for heart and skeletal muscle involvement: 37 % had myositisand 39 % had abnormal electrocardio-grams(ECGs). First-degree atrioventricular heart blockand changes suggestiveofacute pericarditis were the most common ECG findings. Two patients had transient <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rubs,</b> but neither <b>pericardial</b> effusion, shock, nor congestive heart failure occurred. Cardiac involvement was not associated with skeletal muscle injury (P =. 35), although both manifestations were cor-related with severity of disease. Thus, ECG changes and myositis were prominent features of late Weil's disease but cardiac morbidity was not. Though an association between leptospirosis and injury to the heart and skeletal muscles has long been recognized [1, 2], neither the pathogenesis nor the prevalence of these com-plications in late disease has been well defined. It is unclear whether patients with one type of myositis are at increased risk for developing another, because previous studies have fo-cused on either cardiac [2] or striated muscle damage [1] but not both. We therefore prospectively investigated skeletal and heart muscle damage in 38 patients with severe, late leptospi-rosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} and independent factors associated with joint involvement in a large population of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: This study was cross-sectional, based on data collected on patients included in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) registry. We queried this database to extract data regarding global evaluation of patients with SSc {{and the presence of}} any clinical articular involvement: synovitis (tender and swollen joints), tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs</b> (rubbing sensation detected as the tendon was moved), and joint contracture (stiffness of the joints that decreased their range of motion). Overall joint involvement was defined by the occurrence of synovitis and/or joint contracture and/or tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs.</b> RESULTS: We recruited 7286 patients with SSc; their mean age was 56 +/- 14 years, disease duration 10 +/- 9 years, and 4210 (58 %) had a limited cutaneous disease subset. Frequencies of synovitis, tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs,</b> and joint contractures were 16 %, 11 %, and 31 %, respectively. Synovitis, tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs,</b> and joint contracture were more prevalent in patients with the diffuse cutaneous subset and were associated together and with severe vascular, muscular, renal, and interstitial lung involvement. Moreover, synovitis had the highest strength of association with elevated acute-phase reactants taken as the dependent variable. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the striking level of articular involvement in SSc, as evaluated by systematic examination in a large cohort of patients with SSc.

50|$|A pleural <b>friction</b> <b>rub,</b> {{or simply}} pleural rub, is an audible medical sign present in some {{patients}} with pleurisy and other conditions affecting the chest cavity. It is noted by listening to the internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope on the lungs.|$|R
50|$|The {{pericardium}} is a double-walled sac {{around the}} heart. The {{inner and outer}} (visceral and parietal, respectively) layers are normally lubricated by {{a small amount of}} pericardial fluid, but the inflammation of pericardium causes the walls to rub against each other with audible friction. In children, rheumatic fever is often the cause of <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> {{is one of}} several, similar sounds. A {{differential}} diagnosis may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible. <b>Pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> may have one, two, or three audible components, whereas the similar pleural friction rub ordinarily has two audible components. One- and two-component rubs are ambiguous. A three-component rub distinguishes a pericardial rub and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural rub can only be heard during inspiration and expiration, whereas, the pericardial rub can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural rub creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to pericardial rub is always central in location. The intensity of pleural rub is increased on pressing the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the affected area, whereas {{there is no such}} change in case of a pericardial rub.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} tendon and joint {{involvement}} at wrists and ankles of patients suffering from diffuse SSc {{and to identify}} the morphological substrate of tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs</b> (TFRs). Methods. Fifteen consecutive patients suffering from diffuse SSc were included. All patients had two musculoskeletal US (MSUS) examinations of the wrists and ankles. MRI was performed at the most affected joints as detected by MSUS and in all sites in which TFRs were present. Results. No clinically overt arthritis or tenosynovitis was detected in the wrists and/or ankles prior to MSUS. Synovitis, tenosynovitis and tendon tear were identified in 8, 4 and 2 of 15 patients, respectively, by both MSUS and MRI. At entry, 5 patients had palpable TFRs (4 bilateral and 1 unilateral) and 10 patients did not. Tenosynovitis was more frequently found in ankles with TFRs (3 / 9) than in those without TFRs (3 / 21), although {{the difference was not}} statistically different (P = 0. 3). Using MRI, deep connective tissue infiltrates surrounding tendons were present in all sites with TFRs but in only one patient without TFRs. Conclusion. Both MSUS and MRI are effective in detecting synovitis and tenosynovitis in diffuse SSc patients. Tenosynovitis, synovitis and thickened retinacula are not infrequently seen in these patients. Our data suggest that juxta-tendinous connective tissue infiltrates might be the morphological substrate of tendon <b>friction</b> <b>rubs,</b> which may thus be a misnomer for tissue <b>friction</b> <b>rubs...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Dressler {{syndrome}} was, historically, {{a phenomenon}} complicating about 7% of myocardial infarctions; however, {{in the era}} of percutaneous coronary intervention, it is very uncommon. The disease consists of a persistent low-grade fever, chest pain (usually pleuritic in nature), pericarditis (usually evidenced by a <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub),</b> and/or a pericardial effusion. The symptoms tend to occur 2-3 weeks after myocardial infarction, but can also be delayed for a few months. It tends to subside in a few days, and very rarely leads to pericardial tamponade. [...] An elevated ESR is an objective, yet nonspecific, laboratory finding.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> {{is a very}} {{specific}} sign of acute pericarditis, meaning {{the presence of this}} sign invariably indicates presence of disease. However, absence of this sign does not rule out disease. This rub can be best heard by the diaphragm of the stethoscope at the left sternal border arising as a squeaky or scratching sound, resembling the sound of leather rubbing against each other. This sound should be distinguished from the sound of a murmur, which is similar but sounds more like a [...] "swish" [...] sound than a scratching sound. The pericardial rub is said to be generated from the friction generated by the two inflamed layers of the pericardium; however, even a large pericardial effusion does not necessarily present a rub. The rub is best heard during the maximal movement of the heart within the pericardial sac, namely, during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the filling phase of early ventricular diastole.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical incidence and outcomes {{of patients with}} pericarditis after thrombolytic therapy, 810 patients were prospectively studied during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis {{was defined as the}} presence of a <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> during the hospital course. Only 5 % of patients developed a rub during AMI, a low percent compared with that in the prethrombolytic era. A <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> more often occurred in the setting of an anterior wall AMI. Patients with, compared to those without, a <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> had lower ejection fractions (45 vs 51 %, P = 0. 002); worse regional left ventricular function (- 3. 2 vs 2. 7, standard deviation per chord); higher in-hospital mortality (15 vs 6 %, P = 0. 056); a higher frequency of power failure (83 vs 57 %); a higher frequency of anterior wall location of the AMI (53 % of cases, P = 0. 002); and a higher frequency of 3 -vessel disease. Therefore, although the frequency of a <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> was low (5 %) compared with that in the prethrombolytic era, its occurrence denotes more extensive myocardial damage with a worse clinical outcome. Perhaps with successful reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel, transmural myocardial necrosis is prevented and with it the development of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a <b>pericardial</b> <b>friction</b> <b>rub...</b>|$|E
50|$|The classic sign of {{pericarditis}} is a <b>friction</b> <b>rub</b> heard with a stethoscope on {{the cardiovascular}} examination usually {{on the lower}} left sternal border. Other physical signs include a patient in distress, positional chest pain, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), and possibility of heart failure in form of pericardial tamponade causing pulsus paradoxus, and the Beck's triad of low blood pressure (due to decreased cardiac output), distant (muffled) heart sounds, and distension of the jugular vein (JVD).|$|R
5000|$|Respiratory sounds, breath sounds, or lung sounds {{refer to}} the {{specific}} sounds generated by the movement of air through the respiratory system.
