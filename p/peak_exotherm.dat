40|$|ABSTRACT: The curing {{behavior}} of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) with aromatic imide–amines having aryl ether, sulfone, and methylene linkages was studied using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). Six imide– amines of varying structure were synthesized by reacting 1 mol of naphthalene 1, 4, 5, 8 -tetracarboxylic dianhydride (N) or 4, 40 -oxodiphthalic anhydride (O) with excess (> 2 mol) of 4, 40 -diaminodiphenylether [E] or 4, 40 -diaminodiphenyl methane [M] or 4, 40 -diaminodiphenyl sulfone [S]. The im-ide–amines prepared by reacting O or N with S, M, and E have been designated as OS/NS; OM/NM, and OE/NE, respectively. Structural characterization of imide–amines was done using FTIR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and elemental analysis. The curing {{behavior of}} DGEBA {{in the presence of}} stoichiometric amount of imide–amines was investigated by recording DSC scans. A broad exothermic transition was observed and the <b>peak</b> <b>exotherm</b> temperature was found to be dependent on the structure of imide–amines. The <b>peak</b> <b>exotherm</b> temperature (Tp) was lowest in case of imide–amines OE and highest in case of imide–amines NS/OS. Thermal stability of isothermally cured DGEBA in the presence of imide–amines was evaluated by dynamic thermogravimetry. The char yield was highest for resin cured with imide–amines NE. 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{thermodynamics}} of polymerization of a plasticized epoxy polymer were studied by applying a simple recording device for the instantaneous measurement of polymerization temperature. Especially, {{the forms of}} the characteristic exotherm profile during polymerization {{of a series of}} plasticized epoxy polymers were investigated, as well as its variation with respect to time. The characteristic points of the exothenn profile were determined, that is the gel point and the <b>peak</b> <b>exotherm</b> temperature as functions of time elapsed during the process of polymerization, as well as the temperature and time of hardening of mixture. The study was also extended to various percentages of plasticizer and to the functional influence of these percentages on the evolution of the polymerization process. © 1974 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} volume changes {{effected}} during multicomponent resin polymerization/crosslinking (cure shrinkage) {{in an effort}} to reduce or eliminate this phenomenon (zero-shrinkage polymerization). The systems under study contained: a polyfunctional monomer; a second, difunctional low-boiling monomer; and a thermoplastic polymer additive. These components are miscible forming a single (transparent) phase, which remains stable and shows the expected cure shrinkage in slow polymerization. Upon rapid cure (within 2 - 10 minutes) these systems undergo phase separation and show significantly reduced cure shrinkage, attaining zero shrinkage within certain composition ranges. Experimental evidence based on Scanning Electron Microscopy, polymerization under pressure, photopolymerization, and solvent extraction indicates that the reduction in cure shrinkage is due to the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles of the low-boiling monomer within separate microdomains formed during rapid polymerization and precipitated by the high temperatures attained at <b>peak</b> <b>exotherm,</b> as well as negative hydrostatic pressures arising from cure shrinkage of the crosslinked polymer phase...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{simplified}} model systems, simulating the fermentation of 25. 00 % sugar-water {{mixture into}} a 12. 78 % ethanol-water mixture, were considered in order to study their thermo-physical properties. Calorimetric data, viscosity and water activity determinations showed that important thermal and physical changes {{are associated with the}} steps of a fermentation process. Besides the increase in ethanol content, other concomitant changes are a strong increase in ethanol vapor pressure and a decrease in water activity and viscosity. DSC measurements of the models during scanning from - 140 C to 25 C showed three peaks: <b>peak</b> I (<b>exotherm)</b> covered a temperature range from - 110 C to - 80 C and was attributed to the recrystallization of the ethanol monohydrate; peak 2 (endotherm), with peak temperature around - 70 C, was attributed to the melting of the alcoholic monohydrate; peak 3 (endotherm) in the higher temperature range from - 30 C to OC, was due to ice melting. The alcoholic monohydrate appeared only in the final simulated step of the fermentation, where only ethanol and water were present. The inhibitory effect of even small amounts of sugars on the formation of the monohydrate might be related to the increase in viscosity. This would confirm the formation of the ethanol hydrate as kinetically hindered, as it is reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} methods of DSC, TG, DI-MS, Py-GC-FID, Py-GC-MSD {{were used to}} study the thermal degradation of Pinus halepensis pine-needles. As was shown by DSC measurements endotherm peaks {{could be attributed to}} the desorption of high volatility compounds, moisture, softening and/or melting of the waxy constituents of pine-needles; {{as well as to the}} degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose. <b>Exotherm</b> <b>peaks</b> could be attributed to the pyrolysis of lignin and char recombination. These results were reconfirmed by DTG curve. In addition, the DI-MS measurements showed, through the presence of certain mass peaks, the existence of volatile degradation products which can be related to the degradation pathways observed by DSC and TG. Py-GC-FID proved that the evolution of organic degradation products commences at 200 - 250 degrees C and has its maximum evolution rate between 350 and 450 degrees C. Py-GC-MSD analysis of the flash pyrolysis products at 400 degrees C identified a number of organic compounds and CO 2. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|The curing behaviour, chemorheology, {{morphology}} {{and dynamic}} mechanical properties of epoxy[*]−[*]polyphenylene oxide (PPO) blends were investigated {{over a wide}} range of compositions. Two bisphenol A based di-epoxides[*]−[*]pure and oligomeric DGEBA − were used and their cure with primary, tertiary and quaternary amines was studied. 4, 4 ′-methylenebis(3 -chloro- 2, 6 -diethylaniline) (MCDEA) showed high levels of cure and gave the highest <b>exotherm</b> <b>peak</b> temperature, and so was chosen for blending studies. Similarly pure DGEBA was selected for blending due to its slower reaction rate because of the absence of accelerating hydroxyl groups. For the PPO:DGEBA 340 /MCDEA system, the reaction rate was reduced with increasing PPO content due to a dilution effect but the heat of reaction were not significantly affected. The rheological behaviour during cure indicated that phase separation occurred prior to gelation, followed by vitrification. The times for phase separation, gelation and vitrification increased with higher PPO levels due to a reduction in the rate of polymerization. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis of PPO:DGEBA 340 /MCDEA clearly showed two glass transitions due to the presence of phase separated regions where the lower Tg corresponded to an epoxy-rich phase and the higher Tg represented the PPO-rich phase. SEM observations of the cured PPO:DGEBA 340 /MCDEA blends revealed PPO particles in an epoxy matrix for blends with 10 [*]wt% PPO, co-continuous morphology for the blend with 30 [*]wt% PPO and epoxy-rich particles dispersed in a PPO-rich matrix for 40 wt% and more PPO...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of alumina trihydrate (ATH) -filled epoxy resin at loadings {{of up to}} 100 parts by weight ATH per hundred of resin (epoxy and hardener) (pphr) have been investigated. A low <b>peak</b> <b>exotherm,</b> increased Young's modulus and increased critical strain energy release rate (G[sub]IC) and critical stress intensity factor (K[sub]IC) {{can be achieved by}} incorporating a dispersion of ATH into an epoxy resin. However, the high filler loadings required for effective fire resistance reduce tensile strength and elongation. Tensile modulus increases with filler loading in line with previous studies and theoretical equations. However, the tensile strength is higher and the ultimate elongation lower than current theories predict. The tensile and fracture process in ATH-filled epoxy follows linear elastic fracture mechanics, but can be considered in two parts. The initiation of a crack occurs from a large critical flaw, either as a large particle or agglomerations of particles. A flaw can also be formed on the application of a tensile load, when large stress concentrations cause localised microcracking of the matrix. The propagation of a flaw requires more energy and is dependent on several possible mechanisms. Shear yielding and associated crack blunting are shown {{to be the most important}} mechanisms, whilst minor contributions from matrix microcracking and debonding of ATH particles are possible. The absence of crack pinning in this study is believed to be due to the inherently weak nature of ATH particles. The presence of a 10 pphr rubber dispersion in ATH-filled epoxy only increases the values of G[sub]IC and K[sub]IC at low filler loadings. Amine-terminated butadiene acrylonitrile rubber (ATBN) -modified epoxy matrix exhibits little adhesion to ATH and therefore the efficiency of stress transfer between particle and matrix is reduced, diminishing shear yielding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{choice of}} {{inhibiting}} materials for double base and composite modified double base rocket propellants {{has always been}} a difficult problem {{because of the presence of}} nitroglycerine in these propellants and its subsequent migration from the propellant towards the inhibitor. The inhibition of double base rocket propellants with unsaturated polyesters has become popular in recent years, but they usually suffer from the drawback of high nitroglycerine absorption. This may be considerably lowered by exploiting the concept of introduction of electron acceptance sites in one of the components used for the synthesis of unsaturated polyesters. Chloropolyester- 1 (CP- 1) based on tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPAn), propylene glycol (PG) and maleic anhydride (MAn) and chloropolyester- 2 (CP- 2) based on TCPAn [...] Eolyethylene glycol mol. wt. 200 (PEG- 200) and MAn have been synthesised and characterised for ge ltime, <b>exotherm</b> <b>peak</b> temperature, tensile strength, y 0 elongation, bond strength, water absorption, nitroglycerine absorption, heat resistance and flame retardance. The blends of CP-I and CP- 2 designated as CPB- 2 (CP- 1 : CP- 2 : : 20 : 80), CPB- 4 CPB- 6 and CPB- 8 have also been formulated and characterised for these properties. Based on the data for various characteristics, CPB- 4 has been selected for inhibition and static evaluation of rocket propellants. The double base rocket propellant sustainers containing 2 -NDPA have been inhibited with CPB- 4 without the application of any barrier coat and statically fired at ambient, cold (- 40 °C) and hot (+ 5 O”C) temperatures after conditioning. The pressure-time profiles were found to be smooth and flat in all cases, inferring that the CPB- 4 inhibition system (without application of any barrier coat) is working satisfactorily. 1...|$|R
40|$|The studied {{palygorskite}} {{clay mineral}} has been collected from several localities of Marrakech High Atlas Tertiary series. These series consist of alternation of marl, dolomite, limestone, gypsum and phosphatic beds. Palygorskite currently constitutes more than 90 % of the clay fraction of these facies. The {{aim of this}} study is to characterise the structure and the physicochemical properties of these fibrous clays. Several technics were performed to characterise these clay sediments: X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to study its crystal structure. XRF analysis was performed to study the chemical compositions. Differential thermogravimetric analyses (DTA) were used to study the weight loss due to dehydration and dehydroxylation. The microstructure of these fibrous clays is determined by transmission and scanning electron microscop (TEM/SEM). Physical properties were characterised using the plasticity index of Casagrande, the test for shear strength and the oedometer test. The parameter concerning the adsorption capacity of methylene blue is also determined. The palygorskite clays of the Marrakech High Atlas consist of a silty clay of uniform appearance, greyish in color, and very low organic plastic. The thickness of deposit varies from several meters to several hundred meters. SEM and TEM observations show that palygorskite clay minerals display bundle of long fibres wish occurs as interwoven fibrous mats forming the laminae and as coatings and pore-filling, and pore-bridging cements in dolomite. These fibres are characterized by Mg rich chemical compositions, high crystalline structure, high specific surface area and excellent sorptive capacity. XRD show reflections (110) at 10. 5 A, associated with all harmonics. The ATD curves show three endothermic peaks (100 - 200, 250 - 300 and 400 - 500 °C) corresponding to different dehydration process. A fourth <b>exotherm</b> <b>peak</b> often preceded by an endothermic reaction (800 - 900 °C) reflet the crystallization of new mineral phases including mullite. Palygorskite rich samples exhibit a high plasticity index of about 70. The swelling index generally increases with increasing content of palygorskite. In addition, Palygorskite rich samples exhibit high cohesion and a low friction angle. However, the density of the samples decreases with the increase of the content of palygorskite...|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{composite}} materials reinforced with 20, 45 and 60 wt% of fly ash (FA) particles were prepared by injection moulding at 210 ‹C. Tensile {{strengths of the}} composite specimens were measured at 25, 50 and 70 ‹C using a controlled oven in Instron. At 25 ‹C, the composites suffered significant loss in strength, as much as 47 %, whereas, at 50 and 70 ‹C, there was up to 15 % gain in strength. Notched Charpy tests showed a maximum gain of 58 % impact energy for the composite with 45 % FA, tested at 70 ‹C over that of neat PP. In the dynamic mechanical analysis, {{it was observed that}} the addition of FA leads to the significant enhancement of both storage (EŒ) and loss modulus (E) of the composites compared to those of neat PP at a given temperature, supporting the view of the formation of interfacial interaction between the surfaces of PP and FA. The tangent ƒÂ curves of neat PP and composites showed a broader pattern of peak. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was assigned at 70 ‹C for neat PP and 72 to 73 ‹C for composites. Crystallization kinetics PP in composites has been studied non-isothermally and isothermally using differential scanning calorimetry at cooling/heating rates 10 ‹C, 15 ‹C and 20 ‹C per min between 200 ‹C to - 30 ‹C. Whilst neat PP showed a mono modal ƒ¿ crystalline phase- only structure, presence of FA led to bimodal thermographs revealing partial transcrystallisation of ƒ¿ into ƒÀ, to maximum 14 %. The onset and peak crystallization temperatures of all samples decreased by approx 3 ‹C with each 5 ‹C /min increase in cooling rate. Parameters such as crystal growth rate, dimensions and activation energy were determined using a series of established models. The Avrami graphs showed that contrary to the published data, there are two sets of straight lines a) with a lower slope at low cooling rate and b) with a distinctly higher slope for high cooling rate. Activation energy of the materials reached a maximum at 45 % FA. In the study of isothermal crystallization kinetics, the lowest points of the <b>exotherm</b> <b>peaks</b> were shifted to higher crystallization times in the ranges of 0. 75 - 1. 50 min with the increasing of crystallization temperature (Tc) in neat PP and composites regardless of FA percentage addition...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of new finely tunable porous materials has spurred interest in developing novel uses {{in a variety of}} systems. Zeolites, inorganic materials with high thermal and mechanical stability, in particular, have been widely examined for use in applications such as catalysis, ion exchange and separation. A relatively new class of inorganic-organic hybrid materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently surfaced, and many have exhibited their efficiency in potential applications such as ion exchange and drug delivery. A more recent development is the {{design and synthesis}} of a subclass of MOFs based on zeolite topologies (i. e. ZMOFs), which often exhibit traits of both zeolites and MOFs. Bio-compatible hydrogels already {{play an important role in}} drug delivery systems, but are often limited by stability issues. Thus, the addition of ZMOFs to hydrogel formulations is expected to enhance the hydrogel mechanical properties, and the ZMOF-hydrogel composites should present improved, symbiotic drug storage and release for delivery applications. Herein we present the novel composites of a hydrogel with a zeolite-like metal-organic framework, rho-ZMOF, using 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), 2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl methacrylate (DHPMA), N-vinyl- 2 -pyrolidinone (VP) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and the corresponding drug release. An ultraviolet (UV) polymerization method is employed to synthesize the hydrogels, VP 0, VP 15, VP 30, VP 45 and the ZMOF-VP 30 composite, by varying the VP content (mol%). The rho-ZMOF, VP 30, and ZMOF-VP 30 composite are all tested for the controlled release of procainamide (protonated, PH), an anti-arrhythmic drug, in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) using UV spectroscopy. Blister agents are chemical compounds that induce severe skin, eye, mucosal pain and irritation. The research focuses on sequestering a blister agent analog, thioanisole in hydrogels. HEMA polymers and copolymers of HEMA with 2, 3 -dihydroxyproyl methacrylate (DHPMA) and vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) were synthesized with crosslinkers of various dimensions. These were: ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DiEGDMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TriEGDMA), tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TetEGDMA) and neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate (NPEGDMA). Equilibrium swelling was characterized gravimetrically and pore size was estimated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Glass transition temperatures were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The absorption of thioanisole in methanol was characterized with via ultra-violet (UV) spectroscopy. Poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) composites constructed from a paddle-wheel, a secondary building unit (SBU) for metal organic frameworks, Cu 2 (p-OH benzoate) 4 (DMSO) 2 * 2 DMSO (CPW) were also investigated for a broad analysis of dielectric spectra. The dielectric spectrum of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and its copolymer with Poly(2, 3 -dihydroxy propyl methacrylate) (PDHPMA) are already reported in the literature. This study delineates the effects on the dielectric behavior as a result of CPW addition. The dielectric permittivity and the loss factor were measured using a dielectric analyzer in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 k Hz and between the temperature range of - 140 and 250 °C. The electric modulus formalism was used to reveal the viscoelastic and conductivity relaxations present in the polymers. Significant changes were observed as CPW concentration increased from 0. 1 to 0. 5 wt%. It was determined through DSC that the glass transition temperature increased with the filler concentration. The secondary dielectric relaxations were also affected as it was recorded that the activation energy for the γ, Β, and conductivity relaxation increased with CPW content. AC and DC conductivity are also evaluated. The ionic conductivity data revealed that the CPW impedes the ion mobility when compared to the neat PHEMA. Organic azides have become a very vital class of chemical compounds in synthetic organic chemistry and in many more fields due to their applications. Azido compounds are considered high-energetic compounds and are studied very little due to their explosive nature. There is an urge to evaluate the thermal stability of this wide variety of compounds which have tremendous applications in synthetic as well as organic chemistry. Here in we report the thermal stability of some organic azides such as sulfonyl, phosphoryl and carbonyl azides using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as an evaluating tool. Initial temperature of decomposition (Ti) and temperature of maximum decomposition (Tmax) are recorded. The area under <b>exotherm</b> <b>peak</b> during decomposition is used to determine the energy of decomposition (Ed) and is compared to threshold value for hazardous/explosive compounds. The effect of substituent groups at different positions, nature of the substituent groups (electron donating or electron withdrawing) and the steric hindrance on the thermal stability of these azides is studied in detail to verify the explosive nature of these compounds...|$|R
