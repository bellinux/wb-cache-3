5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with the connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant is easily <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E
5000|$|... ''''Right and Left Grand'''', {{also known}} as ''''Grand Right and Left'''', is a square dance move in which all eight dancers in the set, moving in a {{circular}} fashion, execute a series of four alternating hand pull-bies (right <b>pull</b> <b>by,</b> left <b>pull</b> <b>by,</b> right <b>pull</b> <b>by,</b> left <b>pull</b> <b>by).</b> Men (or gents) travel counter-clockwise around the ring, and ladies travel clockwise. The result is that all dancers end up half way across the set facing the same person they started with.|$|R

5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat conditions, but because many chariots were <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> a team of two to four horses, they also {{had to learn to}} work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Franklin D. Richards, {{returning}} from Europe {{where he had}} served as the Church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Ma and Pa {{became an}} early {{favorite}} of railfans, attracted by its hilly, curving line through rural Maryland and Pennsylvania. The railroad offered several popular fan excursions <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> its elderly steam locomotives.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{from the}} south to Flensburg was never {{properly}} used during this evacuation and the Danish army only evacuated what men and horses could carry or <b>pull</b> <b>by</b> road, leaving behind much artillery, most importantly heavy artillery.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how much}} have you spent?" [...] reproachfully asked that rigid young judge, David; {{but all the}} answer he got was a <b>pull</b> <b>by</b> the hair from Hal, and [...] "Hollo, young one! am I to give my {{accounts}} to you?" ...|$|R

5|$|After the windmill, {{wind power}} {{applications}} in other devices and even vehicles {{were found in}} China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although {{it could have been}} known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August, Saturday, {{the body}} was {{transferred}} to the Congress Building for an additional day of public viewing, and a memorial service attended by the entire Argentine legislative body. The next day, after a final Mass, the coffin was laid on a gun carriage <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> CGT officials. It was followed by Peron, his cabinet, Eva's family and friends, the delegates and representatives of the Partido Peronista Femenino—then workers, nurses and students of the Eva Peron Foundation. Flowers were thrown from balconies and windows.|$|E
5|$|Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer {{created the}} track layout and {{operations}} for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the Allies during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for U.S. Steel. Vilmer designed {{the operations of the}} DRR {{in such a way that}} each of its two trains would be assigned to a single station on the rail line, making only complete round trips possible. The Retlaw 1 passenger train <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the Retlaw 2 freight train <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with sidings at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even if the other train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along the full length of its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.|$|E
50|$|On some running plays, an {{offensive}} lineman will <b>pull</b> <b>by</b> {{backing out of}} his initial position and running behind the other offensive linemen to engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line; in modern games this duty usually falls to guards.|$|R

5|$|The German {{pilots were}} {{increasingly}} lacking in quantity and quality. Galland recognised this {{but could not}} correct it without stepping outside his own authority. Galland noticed that the highly educated engineers and trainees were selected for the bomber arm in the early war years. Most of the brightest youth were <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> expert campaigners, toward the Waffen SS and Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe did not match this effort.|$|E
5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{official}} debut was in Toronto on 7 September 2006, at the Ryerson University Theatre {{during the}} Toronto International Film Festival. Baron Cohen arrived in character as Borat in a cart <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> women dressed as peasants. Twenty {{minutes into the}} showing, however, the projector broke. Baron Cohen performed an impromptu act to keep the audience amused, but ultimately all attempts to fix the equipment failed. The film was successfully screened the following night, with Dustin Hoffman in attendance.|$|E

30|$|This can be {{explained}} by two reasons: first, increase in the amount of polymer in electrospinning jet and second, more interaction between polymer chains in solution which later is lead to more resistance of solution against <b>pulling</b> <b>by</b> electrical charges. This behavior is also observed in the study of Sukigara et al. (2004).|$|R
5|$|The first {{indication}} of domesticated horses in England comes from archaeological investigations {{showing that the}} ancient Britons were using wheeled horse-drawn transport extensively in southwest England as early as 400 BC. Recent {{research has indicated that}} there was significant Roman involvement in mining on Exmoor. Metals including iron, tin, and copper were transported to Hengistbury Head in neighbouring Dorset for export, and Roman carvings, showing British and Roman chariots <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor, have been found in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the tunnel}} cost {{the lives of}} 24 men. The grand opening was 9 July 1849, a week later than intended, but the first train, full of Leeds and Thirsk railway officials, <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> Bray's {{locomotive}} Stephenson, went through {{a few weeks earlier}} on 31 May. The railway was opened to the public on 10 July. When built it was the third longest rail tunnel in the country. The Leeds and Thirsk Company was renamed the Leeds Northern Railway shortly after the line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were <b>pulled</b> <b>by</b> schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, we also {{investigated}} {{the proportion of}} <b>pull</b> requests submitted <b>by</b> internals that are also processed by internals (and vice-versa). We observed that 86.4 % of the <b>pull</b> requests submitted <b>by</b> internals are also processed by internals. In comparison, 55.4 % of the <b>pull</b> requests submitted <b>by</b> externals are also processed by externals.|$|R
40|$|Results {{concerning}} {{the distribution of}} mascons on the moon have been obtained from an analysis of Apollo 8, 10, 11, and 12 lunar orbit missions. It was concluded that the tugging and <b>pulling</b> <b>by</b> the moon on the orbit plane of the Apollo spacecraft yields qualitative information {{concerning the}} distribution of the mascons...|$|R
