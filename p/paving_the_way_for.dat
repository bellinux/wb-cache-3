5|$|For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 – Southern Laos Victory, {{was viewed}} as a {{complete}} success. The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery 60 miles in width was soon expanded to 90 miles. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, <b>paving</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, known in the west as the Easter Offensive.|$|E
