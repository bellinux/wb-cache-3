This paper considers alternative schedules based on full irrigation or deficit irrigation {{within the framework of}} area proportionate water distribution in such irrigation schemes and presents the simulation-optimisation technique to develop the corresponding land area and water allocation plan for different allocation units by considering the heterogeneity of the irrigation scheme. This paper further demonstrates the utility of proposed alternative schedules by comparing the productivity and equity of these <b>schedules</b> with <b>planned</b> and actual <b>schedules</b> for one irrigation scheme in Central India.

We argue for using dynamic models to capture such mixed <b>planning</b> and <b>scheduling</b> environment.
