The ore occurs as open-space fillings in faults, fractures, and breccias in the andesite. Early hydrothermal activity was responsible for four types of hypogene alteration in decreasing intensity: silicification, sericitization, hematization and argillic alteration. The mineral assemblage includes pyrolusite, <b>psilomelane,</b> hematite, and barite as well as minor magnetite, manganite, poliannite, limonite, braunite, bixbyite, galena, pyrite, and goethite. Mineralogically, three ore types are recognized as pyrolusite + <b>psilomelane</b> + hematite + barite ore, pyrolusite + <b>psilomelane</b> + poliannite ore and barite + pyrolusite + <b>psilomelane</b> + hematite ore (barite-dominant ore).

40|$|The PhD thesis {{deals with}} two {{different}} ironstone rock types encountered in two sedimentary successions (Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cenozoic) {{in the northern}} Bahariya, Egypt. Occurrence of the two iron-bearing rock types in a same area offers an opportunity to better understanding the origin of ironstone deposits. The ironstones occur as thin crusts within Cenomanian clastic rocks (Bahariya Formation) and as big ore bodies at three mine areas, associated to Eocene carbonate units. Analysis of the two ironstone types {{was carried out by}} means of field, petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical investigations. The ironstones contain similar iron-bearing minerals, mainly goethite and hematite, which display a variety of fabrics, i. e. concretionary, massive, stromatolitic-like, pisolithic, colloidal, reiniform aggregates, boxwork, leisegang, geode-like and brecciated. They show preferential replacement and cementation of carbonates by iron-rich minerals. Thus, the two ironstone types replaced both depositional and diagenetic carbonates (dolomites) with preservation of the structures, fabrics and thickness of their precursors. However, they exhibit some differences in textures, morphology and bed geometries but marked distinction in which refers to origin, mechanisms and timing of formation. The main mineral paragenesis in the Upper Cretaceous ironstones includes goethite, hematite, Fe-dolomite/ankerite and subordinate amounts of siderite, pyrolusite, todorokite, <b>psilomelane</b> and barite.

The available data on crystal structure, x-ray diffraction patterns, physical properties, and chemical composition of these minerals are summarized, with pertinent discussion. The following minerals were investigated: pyrolusite, ramsdellite, manganite, bixbyite, braunite, hausmannite, hetaerolite, cryptomelane hollandite, eoronadite, <b>psilomelane,</b> and lithio-phorite. Of these pyrolusite, cryptomelane, <b>psilomelane</b> and braunite are {{most common and}} probably in that order. The crystal structures {{of some of the}} minerals are closely related. Identifications based on physical properties are highly uncertain, owing to the variability and overlapping of these properties. Hardness is a particularly poor criterion. Optical study by reflected light makes identification of well-crystallized material possible, but identification of fine-grained material in this way is as yet uncertain. X-ray powder photographs are the best means of identification. They must be supple-mented by qualitative chemical tests to distinguish between cryptomelane, hollandite and coronadite, whose x-ray powder photographs differ only slightly. The mineralogical composition of an ore may greatly influence its behavior in the battery.

40|$|The major {{manganese}} {{deposits of}} {{the world can be}} classified into three broad genetic types: hydrothermal, sedimentary, and superficial. The hydrothermal type in-cludes hypogene vein deposits and those formed in thermal spring aprons. The sedimentary type encompasses both volcanogenic and nonvolcanogenic sediments (ancient continental deposits and recent deep sea nodules) and their metamorphosed equivalents. The superficial type consists of deposits formed by residual concentration, by deposition from meteoric waters and by supergene oxidation-enrichment of pre-existing manganese formations. The mineralogy of all manganese formations belonging to the above genetic types is discussed in detail. It is shown that in deposits formed from hot ascending solutions there is a zonal arrangement of minerals.

As revealed by geochemistry and petrology of drill core samples, the Buru centre ranges in composition from surficial lateritized pyroclastic ferrocarbonatite to recrystallized ferruginous calciocarbonatite at depth. Mineralogically the lateritic cover of the Buru carbonatite centre is characterized by goethite, hematite, <b>psilomelane,</b> baryte, fluorite with minor calcite, bastnäsite and significant amounts of monazite. A transitional middle zone consists of ferrocarbonatite grading into ferruginous calciocarbonatite containing siderite, baryte and fluorite, a greater proportion of bastnäsite replacing calcite, but lesser proportions of monazite.

These deposits are associated with Mn-rich garnet metasediments of the Itapira Group (Paleoproterozoic) and the reserves were estimated at approximately 2. 0 × 10 6 tons with an average grade of 23 % MnO 2. The ore minerals are cryptomelane, pyrolusite, lithiophorite, spessartine and <b>psilomelane.</b> Several crystal shapes and textural characteristics were identifi ed in this study, which are related to the degree of liberation, as confi rmed by heavy media separation method. In this study, we determined the main characteristics of the liberation of manganese, which is concentrated in the fi ne grain-size fraction and is lost during ore dressing. Therefore, the low average content of MnO 2 (28 %) is due to this loss, whereas at grain size of minus 0. 074 mm, contents near 40 % MnO 2 were observed. This suggests that the ore can be used for manufacturing manganese sulphate fertilizers. A comparative study with the ore deposits located at Ouro Fino (MG), mainly with the Caneleiras mine, showed that higher degree of liberation occurs in the coarse grain-size fractions (0. 84 to 0. 074 mm with MnO 2 content of 38 %).

40|$|The Nsuta {{manganese}} deposit {{is located}} about 6. 5 km south of Tarkwa {{in the southwestern}} egion of Ghana. It {{is associated with a}} carbonate horizon within a thick series of interbedded grey tufts and thin argillaceous horizons of Precambrian, Upper Birimian age. The manganese oxide mineralization, produced by supergene enrichment ofthe stratiform carbonate horizon, occurs as massive, patchy or bedded accumulations of <b>psilomelane,</b> with numerous veinlets and cavity fillings of pyrolusite. Due to the impact of folding and faulting and past mining activity (open-pit), the remaining resources have a complex spatial distribution. The study described is based on a portion of this deposit referred to as Hill D (South Crest). Initial statistical studies revealed the existence of two assay populations which appear to correspond to two geologically identifiable ore types that cannot be differentiated at the present scale of mining. Two geostatistical methods (ordinary kriging and indicator kriging) were used to evaluate the resource and the estimates so produced were then compared. A wireframe odel was used to constrain the three dimensional geostatistical block model. Manganese occurrences are known in almost all the Regions of Ghana, but the main deposits are found in the Western Region. However, the Nsuta manganese deposit is economically the most important. The other deposits are either too small or their grades are so low that they are currently uneconomic to exploit. The Nsuta manganese deposit is situated alongside the Sekondi-Kumasi railway line.

A study of the distribution of ore elements in nodules both depthwise and over the area of the floor together with compilation of the first schematic maps {{based on the results of}} analyses of samples from 54 stations) enables us to give a more precise empirical relation between the Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Co contents in Indian Ocean nodules, the manganese ratio and the values of the oxidation potential, which vary regularly with depth.

Microprobe investigation of ore rinds revealed the nonuniform distribution of a num¬ber of elements within them, owing to the capacity of particles of hydrated oxides of manganese and iron to adsorb various elements. High concentration of individual elements is correlated with local sectors of the ore rinds, in which the presence of todorokite, in particular, has been noted.
