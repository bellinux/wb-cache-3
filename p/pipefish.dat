25|$|The hogchoker {{flatfish}} {{have been}} historically {{abundant in the}} river, where farmers would use them for inexpensive livestock feed, giving the fish its name. Other unique fish found in the river include the northern <b>pipefish,</b> the lined seahorse, and the northern puffer.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry {{occurs when}} one female gets {{exclusive}} mating rights with multiple males. This is not common, {{but it does}} happen among fish like clownfish that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some <b>pipefish.</b>|$|E

50|$|Solenostomus, {{also known}} as ghost <b>pipefishes,</b> false <b>pipefishes</b> or tubemouth fishes, is a genus of fishes in the order Syngnathiformes. Solenostomus is the only genus in the family Solenostomidae, and {{includes}} six currently recognized species. Ghostpipefishes are related to <b>pipefishes</b> and seahorses. They are found in tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, from Asia to Africa.|$|R

25|$|Some rock pool fish {{which are}} {{temporary}} residents include the long-spined sea scorpion, the <b>pipefish</b> worm, the rock goby {{and the common}} lumpsucker. However some other rock pool fish are territorial in nature, and will stay with the same pool for extended periods. Examples are the common blenny and its near relative the butterfish.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} {{polyandrous}} mating {{can be found}} in the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and groundhoppers). Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as <b>pipefish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Male {{pregnancy}} is the incubation {{of one or}} more embryos or fetuses by male members of some species. In nearly all heterogamous animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the Syngnathidae family (<b>pipefish,</b> seahorses and the leafy seadragon), males perform this function. There are different ideas concerning whether a human male could become pregnant, and, by some definitions of gender identity, humans that identify as men have become pregnant. Male humans incubating fetuses are also a recurring theme in speculative fiction.|$|E

25|$|This {{period of}} {{incubation}} can take {{much longer than}} the production of another clutch of eggs by the female, especially in temperate regions where pregnancies last longer, leading to a reproductive environment in which sexual selection can be stronger on females than on males due to increased male parental investment. Interestingly, this reversal of traditional sex roles has only been found in pipefishes, whereas seahorses have largely been accepted as monogamous. Some <b>pipefish</b> species display classical polyandry because of this unique situation. Male syngnathids usually prefer females with large body size and prominent ornaments such as blue skin pigmentation or skin folds. Intriguingly, syngnathid males in some species are apparently capable of absorbing eggs or embryos while in the brood pouch.|$|E
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the <b>pipefish</b> and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
500|$|A typical teleost fish has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, and locomotion is generally {{provided by a}} lateral undulation of the hindmost part of the trunk and the tail, propelling the fish through the water. There are many exceptions to this method of locomotion, especially where speed is not the main objective; among rocks and on coral reefs, slow swimming with great manoeuvrability may be a desirable attribute. Eels locomote by wiggling their entire bodies. Living among seagrasses and algae, the seahorse adopts an upright posture and moves by fluttering its pectoral fins, and the closely related <b>pipefish</b> moves by rippling its elongated dorsal fin. Gobies [...] "hop" [...] along the substrate, propping themselves up and propelling themselves with their pectoral fins. Mudskippers move {{in much the same}} way on terrestrial ground. In some species, a pelvic sucker allows them to climb, and the Hawaiian freshwater goby climbs waterfalls while migrating. Gurnards have three pairs of free rays on their pectoral fins which have a sensory function but on which they can walk along the substrate. Flying fish launch themselves into the air and can glide on their enlarged pectoral fins for hundreds of metres.|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{seahorses}} and <b>pipefishes</b> (family Syngnathidae) are traded for medicinal purposes and aquaria; some are also sold as souvenirs or curiosities. Brazil {{is one of}} the main suppliers of seahorses for the international aquarium trade, nevertheless, little is known about the magnitude of that trade in the country. With regards to <b>pipefishes,</b> virtually nothing is known about their captures for ornamental purposes in Brazil. The present study assesses the magnitude of captures and trade of seahorses and <b>pipefishes,</b> based on data obtained through a collaborative monitoring program established with the main retailer of marine ornamental organisms in the State of Bahia. The syngnathid fishery is conducted in shallow waters never exceeding 7 m, generally by breathhold diving. Both seahorses and <b>pipefishes</b> are mostly caught by hand, and only rarely hand-nets or plastic bags are used. From January/ 1997 to June/ 2005, 152 fishers recorded their daily catches of syngnathids. Two species of seahorses, Hippocampus reidi and H. cf. erectus (9, 793 specimens captured from 1997 to 2005) and three species of <b>pipefishes,</b> Cosmocampus albirostris, Micrognathus sp. and Syngnathus sp. (143 specimens captured from 1999 to 2005) were traded. H. reidi was the most heavily exploited species...|$|R

2500|$|The Syngnathidae {{family of}} fish has the unique {{characteristic}} of a highly derived form of male brood care referred to as [...] "male pregnancy". The family is highly diverse, containing around 300 different species of fish. Included in Syngnathidae are seahorses, the <b>pipefish,</b> and the weedy and leafy seadragons. The males {{of some of these}} species possess a brood pouch on the trunk or tail; in other species, the eggs are merely attached to the male's trunk or tail when the female lays them. Although biologists' definitions of pregnancy differ somewhat, all members of the family are considered by ichthyologists to display male pregnancy, even those without an external brood pouch.|$|E
