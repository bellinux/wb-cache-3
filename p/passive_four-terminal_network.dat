40|$|This thesis {{examines}} various HVDC converter {{technologies that}} could be used in offshore Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) grids. MTDC grids rely on AC/DC converters to interface with AC systems and also for control services. Two AC/DC topologies were compared, the half-bridge Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) and the Alternate Arm Converter (AAC). As new DC system voltages emerge the DC/DC converter could be an enabling technology for interconnection and future MTDC networks. As yet there is no consensus on DC/DC converter topology and a critical comparison of several potential designs was conducted. An MMC based DC/DC converter had distinct advantages compared with other designs. Several average value converter models of the converters were developed to allow efficient simulation of MTDC networks, while maintaining a high level of accuracy of the converter characteristics. These models were verified with full switching models for steady state and fault conditions. Two o shore MTDC networks were studied; a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network,</b> and a MTDC <b>network.</b> The <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> used a normally open point to connect two existing point-to-point links, allowing reconfiguration in the event of a DC fault. The MTDC network uses a DC/DC converter to interconnect a bipole HVDC link with the previously studied <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network.</b> Several simulation studies show how new converters can improve the operation of a MTDC and provide additional capabilities such as DC fault blocking.

Measure-ment of cavity Q's from standing-wave patterns, including {{the effect of}} series loss in the input lead, is described. In addition to the method in-volving measurement of the resonance curve half-width, a method is given for obtaining the unloaded Q from {{the slope of the}} curve of the position of the voltage minimum vs. wavelength. Methods of determining the electric field from measurements of power and cavity parameters are discussed, and these methods are extended to low-Q cases, encountered with heavy discharge cur-rents, by means of a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> theory. The discharge admittance from the cavity and <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> points of view is discussed for low and high discharge current densities.

50|$|A true {{differentiator}} {{cannot be}} physically realized, {{because it has}} infinite gain at infinite frequency. A similar effect can be achieved, however, by limiting the gain above some frequency. Therefore, a passive differentiator circuit can be made using a simple first-order high-pass filter, with the cut-off frequency set to be far above the highest frequency in the signal. This is a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> consisting of two passive elements as shown in Figures 1 and 2.|$|R

In complex circuit network of electrified railway station, impedance match bond is designed to ensure the normal operation of the track circuit {{and the protection of}} strong traction current interference. As a combination of strong and weak electricity components of track circuit, impedance match bond is both the part of the loop of the traction current and the part of the transmission line of track circuit, playing a very critical role in the electrified railway. The structure of impedance match bond is more complex than traditional impedance transformer, including the transformer with larger air-gap, LC resonance circuit for power frequency filtering, and components to enhance the signal frequency. Modeling on impedance match bond and study about the <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> parameters of impedance match bond are in favor of the following two aspects: modeling of the overall traction current and calculation of track circuit working condition. By applying the transformer equivalent circuit model and combination of testing and calculation, the accurate model of impedance match bond is constructed and verified. Finally, for ease of track circuit calculation, <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> model of impedance match bond under different signal carrier frequencies is presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{possibilities for}} connecting 2. 4  GW {{of power from}} two separate wind farms at Dogger Bank in the North Sea to the GB transmission system in Great Britain. Three options based on HVDC with Voltage Source Converters (VSC HVDC) are investigated: two separate point-to-point connections, a <b>four-terminal</b> multi-terminal <b>network</b> and a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> {{with the addition of}} an AC auxiliary cable between the two wind farms. Each option is investigated in terms of investment cost, controllability and reliability against expected fault scenarios. The paper concludes that a VSC-HVDC point-to-point connection is the cheapest option in terms of capital cost and has the additional advantage that it uses technology that is commercially available. However, while multi-terminal connections are more expensive to build it is found that they can offer significant advantages over point to point systems in terms of security of supply and so could offer better value for money overall. A multi-terminal option with an auxiliary AC connection between wind farms is found to be lower cost than a full multi-terminal DC grid option although the latter network would offer ability to operate at greater connection distances between substations...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for {{the calculation of}} the surge impedance of high-voltage towers is presented. The tower is represented by a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> for which the surge characteristics are determined by solving the transmission-line equations. The boundary conditions of voltage {{at the top and}} base of the tower are determined using a numerical solution of the electromagnetic field on a physical model of the tower. The physical model is a multiconductor geometrical model incorporating the conductors forming the main body, the slanted conductors, and the horizontal cross-arms where necessary. In the process of computing the terminal voltages and currents, soil resistivity effects are also taken into account. Surge impedance values obtained using this method are in good agreement with both published analytical formulae and field experiments...|$|R

An important view that permeates the chapter is that the nullor-based models are not too complex and they can be introduced in CAD tools. Furthermore, parasitic elements can easily be added in order to predict their impact on the final response of the circuit. Several examples using nullor-based models illustrate its use to calculate fully-symbolic small-signal characteristics of linear or linearized analog circuits. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to review {{theoretical}} model concepts in through- the -earth transmission of electromagnetic waves. While the subject is very broad in its defined scope, we will be conscious of the specific applications to mine rescue and emergency telecommunications in coal mine environments. The plan of the paper is to outline previous theoretical efforts without attempting to attach names or organizations to the specific developments. However, we include a guide to the literature as an appendix. Without pretending to be entirely impartial we include a critique of the limitations of the available analytical models. As I see it the central problem is to calculate the steady state mutual impedance of a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> that is the black box characterizing the through-the-earth path. Problems of secondary importance include the determination of the input impedances of the two pairs of terminals and the associated transient responses. ...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{power and}} {{amplitude}} are essential factors in ultrasonic drawing processes, especially for difficult-to-draw materials like titanium and its alloys. This paper presents a new composite power-superimposed ultrasonic vibrator for wire drawing which {{was driven by}} three separate ultrasonic transducers. The transducers were uniformly distributed around the circular {{cross section of the}} vibrator, with their axes along the radial direction and pointing to the center. The vibrator can concentrate the vibrational energy of multiple transducers and transform the radial vibration into a longitudinal vibrator because of the Poisson effect and therefore output larger vibration power and amplitude. In the paper, the <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> method was used to establish the vibration equations of the vibrator. The FE model was established in ANSYS to investigate its characteristics under various excitation conditions. A prototype was manufactured and measurements were performed to verify the validation of FEA results. The results matched well with the theoretical results. It was found that the composite vibrator achieved an amplitude of about 40 μm when driven by square wave signals with 120 ° in phase difference, which implies a potential way of applying ultrasonic vibration to the processing of difficult-to-draw materials...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} a {{feasibility}} {{study on the}} use of surface acoustic wave (SAW) vibration sensors for electronic warning systems is presented. The system is assembled from concatenated SAW vibration sensors based on a SAW delay line manufactured on a surface of a piezoelectric plate. Vibrations of the plate are transformed into electric signals that allow identification of the sensor and localization of a threat. The theoretical study of sensor vibrations leads us to the simple isotropic model with one degree of freedom. This model allowed an explicit description of the sensor plate movement and identification of the vibrating sensor. Analysis of frequency response of the ST-cut quartz sensor plate and a damping speed of its impulse response has been conducted. The analysis above was the basis to determine the ranges of parameters for vibrating plates to be useful in electronic warning systems. Generally, operation of electronic warning systems with SAW vibration sensors is based on the analysis of signal phase changes at the working frequency of delay line after being transmitted via two circuits of concatenated <b>four-terminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Frequencies of phase changes are equal to resonance frequencies of vibrating plates of sensors. The amplitude of these phase changes is proportional to the amplitude of vibrations of a sensor plate. Both pieces of information may be sent and recorded jointly by a simple electrical unit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} DC breaker {{requirements}} for different DC breaker protection schemes for high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids. DC breakers {{are essential for}} DC grid protection as they can provide a selective and fast protection. The DC breakers experience challenging operation conditions which results in an increased cost to meet the breaker requirements. The breaker requirements are strongly determined by the employed protection system. As such, the solution of breaker and protection system is strongly linked. A solution to reduce the requirements is by choosing the best suited protection method concerning the breaker requirements. In this paper, two proposed protection methods and their breaker requirement are explained and compared. The first protection method is a full selective DC protection (FSP) similar to AC protection. A second option, referred to as open grid protection (OGP), is by opening each breaker independently {{in case of a}} fault. The reduction potential of the dissipated energy requirement of the DC breaker of both protection schemes is simulated by applying a pole-to-ground DC fault in a <b>four-terminal</b> <b>network</b> with modular multi-level converters. The required energy for the different protection schemes is investigated for different current ratings and switching times. All studies have been performed using PSCAD/EMTDC. From the advantages and drawbacks of these two protection schemes, a new protection method is proposed. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} {{features of}} Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are attractive for practical implementation of Multi-Terminal HVDC transmission systems (MTDC). MTDC {{can be used}} for large-scale integration of offshore wind power with onshore grids. However, many of the control strategies for MTDC that have been proposed previously for offshore wind farm integration depend on local control of the wind turbine generators. This paper proposes a new control strategy, termed Current Matching Control (CMC), which can be used with any number of converter terminals, and is independent of the types of wind turbines used within each wind farm. The proposed CMC matches the current reference of the grid side converter to that of the wind farm side converters. In order to achieve such current matching, a telecommunication system will be required to facilitate calculations of the grid side current references to be carried out in real time. To validate the performance of the proposed control strategy, a generic <b>four-terminal</b> MTDC <b>network,</b> which integrates two offshore wind farms with two mainland grids, is simulated and results relating to several steady state and transient scenarios are presented...|$|R
