The {{internal}} friction of the hyperstabilized martensite demonstrates very low values, both {{above and below}} the nominal <b>martensitic</b> <b>transformation</b> temperature, due to a pronounced pinning effect.

The ribbons comprised a mixture of austenite with L 2 (1) cubic structure and non-modulated martensite with L 1 (0) tetragonal structure.

This finding may be attributed to the appearance of the gamma-precipitated phase, which was lacking in the other samples. The <b>martensitic</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>with</b> a large magnetocaloric effect can be tailored in a wide temperature range, i. e., 30 K for the as-spun ribbons and 33 K for the annealed ribbons.
