5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Samsulbahri (sometimes spelled Sjamsulbahri; {{abbreviated}} Samsu) is {{the primary}} male protagonist. He is described as having skin the colour of langsat, with eyes as black as ink; however, from afar he can be confused with a Dutchman. These <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> have been described by Keith Foulcher, a lecturer of Indonesian language and literature at the University of Sydney, as indicating Samsu's mimicry and collaborationist nature. His good looks are also seen as a physical manifestation of his moral and kind nature.|$|E

5|$|After her {{drama school}} education, Leigh {{appeared}} in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed {{to the role}} of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in the world in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; in addition to his <b>physical</b> <b>attributes,</b> he is also comfortable on the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been {{described}} variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a stony meteorite. , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.|$|E
5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements of their <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E
5|$|When Fortress mode is selected, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to choose the embark {{location}} in the world. The player can consider the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations which can pose significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress. Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> are randomly generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also randomly generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed.|$|E

50|$|Tom Landry, {{the head}} coach of the second-year Cowboys, made the gamble to acquire him, looking to perfect his 'Doomsday Defense'. The {{transaction}} paid off and Howley remained a phenomenal athlete, even after the knee injury. Perhaps his most noteworthy <b>physical</b> <b>attribute</b> was his speed. Landry once said that Howley might have made it in the NFL as a running back if he hadn't been too valuable to move from linebacker.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{offers from}} Bologna and Milan, Buffon {{began his career}} with the Parma youth system in 1991, at the age of 13. During his time in the youth academy, he {{initially}} played in several out-field positions, in particular as a midfielder, before switching to his current position of goalkeeper. His idol Thomas N'Kono inspired this change of position due to his notable goalkeeping performances for Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup in Italy; as a result, when both of the Parma youth team's keepers suddenly suffered injuries, Buffon was called upon due to his interest, height and <b>physical</b> <b>attributes.</b> He quickly adapted to this role, and within two weeks he had been promoted to first keeper of the Parma youth team. Ermes Fulgoni, the academy's goalkeeping coach, would soon become a mentor to the young goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong <b>physical</b> <b>attributes.</b> Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the <b>physical</b> <b>attributes</b> of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{soil use}} is {{becoming}} increasingly relevant given the increase of anthropic activities. In order to evaluate changes in soil bulk density, soil particles density, soil macroporosity, soil microporosity and soil total porosity, a Red-Yellow Latossol after one year cultivation of two legumes species and spontaneous vegetation, soil samples were collected at two depths (0. 0 to 20. 0 cm and 20. 0 to 40. 0 cm). Soil bulk density (Ds) was determined by measuring the ring volume. Soil particles density (Dp) were determined by the method of volumetric flask. The determination of macro and microporosity {{was made by the}} use of porous plate Richards extractor. Results showed that the interaction between the different vegetation covers and the depth was not significant for any measured soil <b>physical</b> <b>attribute.</b> The canopy significantly influenced the values of microporosity, however did not affected any other studied <b>physical</b> <b>attribute.</b> The soil depth of 0 - 20 cm showed higher macroporosity than the depth of 20 - 40 cm and is inversely proportional to the microporosity.

40|$|Over the {{performance}} {{period of the}} research grant, the authors conducted {{a study of the}} role that the detector response plays in the detection of gamma-ray bursts. The goal {{of the study was to}} determine whether the fact that the gamma-ray bursts observed by the BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory are characterized by approximately the same characteristic energy is a consequence of the instrument's characteristics, or whether the distribution is a <b>physical</b> <b>attribute</b> of gamma-ray bursts. The authors succeeded in showing that instrumental effects are mild, and that the observed characteristic energy is a <b>physical</b> <b>attribute</b> of bursts. In the course of this research, the authors ported the computer code for calculating the BATSE detector response matrices to the Sun Solaris platform, and created a version of the code that runs under any platform that supports a Fortran 77 compiler with DEC extensions. This code has already been used by other investigators to analyze BATSE data. The authors constructed a Monte Carlo simulation of the BATSE burst trigger, with which they determined the efficiency of detecting a burst as a function of characteristic burst spectral energy. The results were then applied to BATSE observations to determine the physical model for the distribution of burst characteristic energies...|$|R
