5|$|Regret's death {{triggers}} discord {{among the}} races of the Covenant, as the Hierarchs {{have given the}} Brutes the Elites' traditional job of <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> {{in the wake of}} the death. The Arbiter is sent to find Halo's Index and captures it, Johnson, and Keyes before being confronted by Tartarus. He reveals to the Arbiter that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites, and sends the Arbiter falling down a deep chasm.|$|E
5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into pieces, {{are believed to have}} served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E

That year, Massino and Salvatore Vitale secured no-show jobs with the Long Island based King Caterers in exchange for <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from Lucchese extortion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} its critics, his {{architecture}} is widely appreciated. He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|Charles Holden (12 May 1875 – 1 May 1960) was an English {{architect}} {{best known}} for designing many London Underground stations during the 1920s and 1930s. Other notable designs were Bristol Central Library, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London's headquarters at 55 Broadway and the University of London's Senate House. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, indicating that they {{are considered to be}} of architectural or historical interest and <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from unapproved alteration. He also designed over 60 war cemeteries and two memorials in Belgium and northern France for the Imperial War Graves Commission from 1920 to 1928.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat {{has been converted}} for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E
5|$|Augustine flees {{back to the}} D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, {{where he}} is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she {{threatened}} to hurt his daughter. Delsin can choose to either kill Hank, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies {{an assault on the}} D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers.|$|E

5|$|From early 1944, No. 266 Squadron {{took part}} in ground attack {{operations}} over the Channel and northern France, operating from RAF Harrowbeer in Devon. The squadron also escorted Allied bombers embarking on or returning from raids, <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from German fighters. Larger petrol tanks were fitted to the Typhoons to increase their range. In May 1944 the squadron was visited by the Prime Minister, who had been knighted and was now Sir Godfrey Huggins. Over the next month, {{in preparation for the}} imminent Allied invasion of Normandy, the Rhodesian aircraft took on a fighter-bomber role, flying sorties across the channel twice a day and participating in the bombing of bridges, roads, railways and the like.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square {{was packed with}} sightseers and fans and police were unable to control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from persecution during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the case, significant sections in Decay are dedicated to working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 2016, Anbang {{announced}} plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with {{the remainder of the}} rooms remaining hotel suites. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017, with plans to reopen it in 2020. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La Chine, closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from any alteration during the renovations.|$|E
5|$|The Cultural and Educational rights, {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} {{to protect the rights}} of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E
5|$|Trieste {{returned}} to action in August 1942 for {{an operation that}} was cancelled following the torpedoing of another Italian cruiser by a British submarine. Trieste was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943. Salvage work on Trieste began in 1950. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to La Spezia; an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into the machinery spaces, <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> while the ship had been submerged. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952 and had her towed to Ferrol, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The project ultimately came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project, forcing its cancellation in 1956. She was ultimately broken up by 1959.|$|E

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue <b>protecting</b> <b>them,</b> but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|Sophie is an amnesiac girl Asbel, Hubert, Cheria, and Richard befriend. She is {{seemingly}} killed after <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from Lambda. She reappears {{seven years}} later when Asbel and Cheria were in danger. Sophie is revealed to be Protos Heis, a humanoid made of tiny particles acting in concert with each other. Her death seven years ago is explained as Sophie breaking up into particles residing inside Asbel, Hubert, and Cheria to heal their wounds and is the reason the three possess mystical powers. During the events of Lineage and Legacies, Sophie expresses her fears of life {{after the death of}} her friends due to her immortality. To lessen her fears, Asbel formally adopts her into the Lhant family. After fusing with a Little Queen, Sophie ages to an adult and is able to express a greater variety of emotions. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa and dubbed by Cassandra Morris. Since her debut, Sophie has ranked on the Tales character popularity polls. Sophie is a playable character in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 3.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> from snakes.|$|E
