40|$|The nine {{samples from}} each {{slaughterhouse}} were pooled and sub-sampled to make three samples per slaughterhouse. Dried PSW samples were ground through a 1 mm screen (Wiley mill, Arthur H. Thomas, Philadelphia, PA), and samples analyzed for amino acids, total nitrogen, fat, ash and organic matter (AOAC, 1990). The CNCPS protein fractions of the PSW was determined according to standardized procedure of Licitra et al. (1996) at the University of Bahonar, Kerman. The B 2 fraction {{was calculated by}} difference and results are reported as CP percentage. Phosphate buffer soluble nitrogen (PBSN) was determined using the phosphate buffer. Neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN) and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) were determined as the nitrogen content of the residual after neutral and acid detergent procedures. The analysis of 11 amino acids i. e. arginine, cysteine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine in three different PSW samples was performed using NIRS, FOSS 5000 Denmark at the Paya Amin Mehr Company (Tehran, Iran). The generation of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste from poultry production is not only unavoidable but the amount and kinds of waste can cause environmental problems. In the present study, the potential rumen digestion of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste which consists of protein-rich organic residues was evaluated. The chemical composition, amino acid profile and Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System fractions of these wastes was determined. Rumen digestion of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste was compared with two common protein sources (fish meal and roasted soybean). Three <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste samples were collected from industrial poultry slaughter-houses and the in situ degradation was done using rumen cannulated sheep. The protein (50 e 63 %), ether extracts (18 e 27 %) and ash (9 e 15. 5 %) contents of different <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste samples were different (P < 0. 05). Methionine and lysine contents were similar among different <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste sources. Difference were observed for cystine (1. 2 e 1. 7 %), threonine (1. 9 e 2. 2 %), arginine (3 e 3. 5 %), leucine (3. 5 e 4. 1 %) and valine (2. 8 e 3. 3 %) (P < 0. 05). Ruminal degradation rate for dry matter, organic matter and protein were different among <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste, fish meal and roasted soybean. The degradation parameter for protein degradation was 76 % for <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste, 79 % for fish meal and 98 % for roasted soybean (P < 0. 05). Results revealed that there was great variation in chemical composition, protein fractioning, and amino acid profiles of different <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste sources. <b>Poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste is slowly-degraded protein in the rumen and thus can be an economical and rich source of rumen undegradable protein in ruminant nutrition.

The prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella isolated from 41 small scale <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> in Chiang Mai, Thailand were determined during July 2011 through May 2012. Salmonella’s prevalence in live poultry, carcasses, waste water, and soil around processing plants were 3. 2 %, 7. 3 %, 22. 0 % and 29. 0 %, respectively. Eighteen different serotypes were identified, the most common being Corvallis (15. 2 %), followed by Rissen (13. 9 %), Hadar (12. 7 %), Enteritidis (10. 1 %), [I. 4, 5, 12 : i : -] (8. 8 %), Stanley (8. 8 %), and Weltevreden (8. 8 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT Avian {{coronavirus}} {{infectious bronchitis}} virus (IBV) poses {{a major threat}} to the global poultry industry. New IBV geno- and serotypes are continually reported. However, information on IBV prevalence is not frequently addressed in these reports. This study reports on a viral surveillance program in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 with sampling conducted in <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses.</b> The genetic features of the obtained field isolates were investigated using sequence analy-sis and SimPlot analysis. A 1 -directional neutralization test was performed to examine the antigenic variations among the collected viruses. The selection pressures that may contribute to the evolution of Taiwan IBV during recent decades were assessed. The surveillance program revealed that 8 out of 47 flocks (17 %) were IBV-infected, from which 13 IBV isolates were recov-ered. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the S 1 gene, 11 of 13 isolates (84. 6 %) clustered with Taiwan group I. One IBV isolate showed evidence of frequent recom-bination events with China-like IBV in the spike gly-coprotein (S) gene. Another isolate demonstrated the incorporation of China-like and H 120 -like genome frag-ments within the S 2 gene and the membrane protein (M) gene region, respectively. Some antigenic chang-es were found in the 1 -directional neutralization test. However, no positive selection pressures were related to those variations in the S 1 genes among Taiwan IBV. Based on our work, we suggest that sampling chickens in <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> is an effective and valuable means of compiling viral prevalence data, particularly in situations where there is subclinical infection.

By the 1960s, machines that did this more efficiently, and automatically, were developed. This allowed companies to use previously wasted materials and, in turn, sell the derived meat products {{to the public for}} a lower price. During the 1970s, these techniques became more common {{in other parts of the}} world, as well. In addition to <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses,</b> newcomers entered the market as they recognized the financial gains that mechanically separated meat processing allowed. Eastern European countries, especially, are known for their import of frozen chicken MSM.|$|R
40|$|Mental {{illness is}} one of the reasons for the great number of {{absences}} from work due to incapacity in Brazil. Recently, mental disorders were included in the list of occupational diseases of the International Labour Office. In spite of the difficulty in attributing a causal link between an inappropriate work environment and mental illness, studies have shown that workers exposed to high levels of stress are more likely to present psychopathological symptoms. The present study investigated the relationship between working conditions and the Neuroticism personality factor. Participants were 951 workers from southern Brazilian <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses,</b> who work in positions with varied levels of risk and stress. The neuroticism scores of such employees were compared with those of other samples. A scale which measures the Neuroticism factor in the model of the Big Five Personality Factor validated for use in Brazil was employed. The results showed that workers of the sectors in which the working conditions are highly stressful presented higher levels in all sub-factors of neuroticism than workers in other sectors and groups. These sectors also showed higher indexes of mental disorders...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess direct and {{indirect}} damages of dairy processors and pig and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> in The Netherlands following the occurrence of a feed crisis. Design/methodology/approach – Starting from a number of feed crisis scenarios the paper analyses processing industry damage parameters through a combination of sector data and individual company assessments. In case of confidential data, outcomes are presented as indices. Findings – The paper finds that, in the most likely scenario, it is expected that a feed crisis affects 15 processors, i. e. 20 per cent of processing business in The Netherlands. Processors’ direct damage is largely (. 90 per cent) determined by the mixing of produce during various phases of processing. Indirect damage is on average perceived not to exceed direct damage. Practical implications – The results are useful in current stakeholder debates on sharing damage burdens of feed crises across supply chain partners. Originality/value – This paper extends currently available risk analyses of feed contaminations by eliciting damage beyond farm leve...|$|R
