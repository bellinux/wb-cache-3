In addition, the ion kinetic energy distribution was analysed. We find that the ablation is caused by surface explosion. The origin of thi...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{microfluidics}} {{has become}} an indispensable component of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology [1 – 3], with polymer devices establishing {{a greater role in}} the development of disposable microfluidic systems [4]. One such polymer is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which is used in the fabrication of a wide variety of microfluidic devices [4, 5], from micro-reactors [4] to high aspect ratio microstructures [6], blood filters [7], and waveguide devices [8]. Additionally, PMMA microfluidic systems may be fabricated using a wide range of techniques, including injection molding, hot embossing, laser <b>photo-ablation,</b> and X-ray lithography [3, 4, 6, 7, 9].|$|E
40|$|The optic tectum of {{zebrafish}} {{is involved}} in behavioral responses that require the detection of small objects. The superficial layers of the tectal neuropil receive input from retinal axons, while its deeper layers convey the processed information to premotor areas. Imaging with a genetically encoded calcium indicator revealed that the deep layers, {{as well as the}} dendrites of single tectal neurons, are preferentially activated by small visual stimuli. This spatial filtering relies on GABAergic interneurons (using the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid) that are located in the superficial input layer and respond only to large visual stimuli. <b>Photo-ablation</b> of these cells with KillerRed, or silencing of their synaptic transmission, eliminates the size tuning of deeper layers and impairs the capture of prey...|$|E
40|$|Gold/chitosan nanocomposites were {{synthesized}} {{and evaluated}} as a therapeutic {{agent for the}} photothermal therapy. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with controllable optical absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region were prepared by the reaction of chloroauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. To apply these particles to cancer therapy, the bare Au NPs were coated with chitosan (CS), O-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), and a blend of CS and CMCS for utilizations in physiologic conditions. The surface properties, optical stability, and photothermal ablation efficiency on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) and human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) demonstrate that these gold nanocomposites have great potential as a therapeutic agent in in vitro tests. The CS-coated nanocomposites show the highest efficiency for the <b>photo-ablation</b> on the HepG 2 cells, and the CS and CMCS blended coated particles show the best discrimination between the cancer cell and normal cells. The well-controlled NIR absorption and the biocompatible surface of these nanocomposites allow low-power NIR laser activation and low-dosage particle injection for the cancer cell treatment...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are {{percutaneous}} {{techniques such as}} radio frequency ablation, laser <b>photo-ablation,</b> and ethanol injection. The advantages of these methods include the ease of pinpointing the nidus with tomography and a reduced morbidity rate due to minimal resection of the bone (Akhlaghpoor et al. 2007, Vanderschueren et al. 2002, Gangi et al. 2007, Rosenthal et al. 1998, Nayman et al. 2011, Mahnken et al. 2006, Busser et al. 2011, Capanna et al. 1991, Adam et al. 1995, Peyser et al. 2009, Lindner et al. 2001). These techniques show relapse rates comparable with those of open resectioning and do not require post-operative immobilization because the patient can bear weight on the operated limb {{as soon as the}} first day after the procedure. The disadvantages include the high cost of acquiring the probes and specific materials required by these techniques and being unable to confirm the complete resection of the nidus during the procedure (Vanderschueren et al. 2002, Lindner et al. 2001). An additional disadvantage is the low rate of anatomopathological confirmation due to the scant quantity of material sent for biopsy, even though this rate can range from 36 % to 90 % (Fenichel et al. 2006, Gangi et al. 2007, Peyser et al. 2009, Lindner et al. 2001, Mylona et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop and {{validate}} a model and a numerical code describing the laser matter interaction and also laser ablation. The laser wavelength is 193 nm and the pulse duration is several nanoseconds. Design/methodology/approach - The developed model is based on strong theoretical background (cf. references). The electronic nonequilibrium aspect is always taken into account. The electronic nonequilibrium is one of the key aspect the UV laser matter interaction and must be treated carefully and that is not always the case. The numerical code was developed using efficient and versatile numerical methods. The model and simulations are always compared to experiments in order to validate them and also to find their limitations. Findings - This work has greatly improved the code accuracy. The key role of the electronic nonequilibrium is also demonstrated. From experimental comparisons it is obvious that <b>photo-ablation</b> should be taken into account for the lower fluences, but to do so, a completely new approach must be developed. Originality/value - This work describes the whole laser ablation process with the electronic nonequilibrium effects properly modeled. The numerical results has always been confronted to experiments, in most of the cases the agreement was very good. When it was not the case, explanations have been sought along with ways to improve the approach...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of an Er:YAG laser (2960 nm) to prepare class V cavities as compared with rotary instruments. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six freshly extracted human molars were selected and randomly distributed in two groups. Non standardized class V cavities were prepared using (group 1) a diamond bur for enamel, plus a tungsten bur for dentin with water irrigation and (group 2) an Er:YAG laser (output parameters, enamel: 1000 mJ, 12 Hz, dentin: 500 mJ, 20 Hz) with a continuous flow of water. Results: The SEM examination revealed characteristic micro-irregularities of the lased samples as compared with the conventional prepared cavities: group 1, the walls of the cavities were slightly curved and a smear layer plus muds covered peripheric walls as well as the depth of the cavity; rare dentinal tubules were opened; linear and circular surface irregularities were observed on the dentin; and group 2, the walls of the cavities were irregular, jagged; <b>photo-ablation</b> creates a real cleavage of hydroxyapatite prisms with respect to the enamel prism pathway; an homogeneous dentin with opened dentinal tubules covered the depth of the cavities; intertubular dentin is selectively more ablated than Er-YAG the peritubular dentin. Conclusions: Jagged outline as well as opened dentinal tubules are the main characteristics of the Er-YAG prepared class V cavities. Further investigations (ulstrastructural, histochemical properties of the lased dentin, resistance to traction of bonded resins) should be conducted.

40|$|Tissue {{homeostasis}} requires rigorous control {{mechanisms for}} stem cell division {{and maintenance of}} a stable stem cell niche. Cancer stem cells are a subgroup of cancer cells that possess stem cell-like properties, including self-renewal and differentiation, but have subverted the control apparatus. We have identified that the tumor suppressor miR- 34 a, a noncoding small RNA targeting Notch, {{plays an important role}} regulating the division of colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and, in turn. controls the bimodality of heterogeneous population of colonic tumors. Moreover, we find out miR- 34 a directly suppresses the canonical cell fate determinant Numb to form an incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) that enhances bimodality of CCSC cell fate determination. Integrative high-throughput analysis suggests that CCSCs and non-CCSCs might globally adopt reprogrammed metabolic functions leading to differential epigenetic regulation. In the normal intestine stem cell (ISC) niche, ISCs and Paneth cells form a stable pattern to control stem cell behavior. However, how the pattern manages to dynamically recover from damage is unclear. A novel optical approach integrating a highprecision femtosecond <b>photo-ablation</b> laser and in vivo imaging system revealed robust pattern recovery after local perturbation in intestine stem cell niche. Computationally and experimentally, we discovered a Notch 1 positive feedback (PF) critical to regulate ISC selfrenewal and regeneration. In this dissertation, the integrative engineering approaches led us to understand dynamic regulation of normal ISCs and CCSCs. iii 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{originates}} by {{a recent}} study on the uncovering of a scalar trend for the spectral characteristics related to the oxidation/crosslinking in an artificially aged resin film. It {{has been found that}} by moving {{from the surface of the}} aged resin towards its interface with the paint layer, crosslinking decreases. In the present work, the existence of this trend is tested on original samples, three 19 th century Byzantine icons covered with natural aged varnish layers of different type and thickness. The varnish layers have representative problems due to aging and preservation. The verification of the deterioration trend was possible by measuring the solubility of the material at subsequent depth-steps created within the same varnish layer. The realization of a number of satisfactory homogenous depth-steps, with enough space to perform the necessary solubility tests, has been possible through UV <b>photo-ablation</b> using a KrF excimer laser. The results of the chemical tests revealed that there is, indeed, an exponential gradient of the deterioration across the film thickness, which is directly related with an equivalent gradient in the solubility within the same varnish layer. Consequently, the deeper one goes into a varnish layer, progressively more dilute solutions of the appropriate solvent in an inert medium are required to remove it. The benefits of a combination of chemical with laser cleaning of resin-based varnishes are demonstrated, and at the same time, lasers are established as a complementary and useful tool in conservation...|$|E
40|$|HST- 10 {{is one of}} {{the largest}} proplyds in the Orion Nebula and is located {{approximately}} 1 ' SE of the Trapezium. Unlike other proplyds in Orion, however, the long-axis of HST- 10 does not align with theta 1 C Ori, but is instead aligned with the rotational axis of the HST- 10 disk. This cannot be easily explained using current photo-evaporation models. In this letter, we present high spatial resolution near-infrared images of the Orion proplyd HST- 10 using Keck/NIRC 2 with the Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics system, along with multi-epoch analysis of HH objects near HST- 10 using Hubble Space Telescope WFPC 2 and ACS cameras. Our narrow-band near-IR images resolve the proplyd ionization front (IF) and circumstellar disk down to 23 AU at the distance to Orion in Br gamma, He I, H_ 2, and PAH emission. Br gamma and He I emission primarily trace the IF (with the disk showing prominently in silhouette), while the H_ 2 and PAH emission trace the surface of the disk itself. PAH emission also traces small dust grains within the proplyd envelope which is asymmetric and does not coincide with the IF. The curious morphology of the PAH emission may be due to UV-heating by both theta 1 C Ori and theta 2 A Ori. Multi-epoch HST images of the HST- 10 field show proper motion of 3 knots associated with HH 517, clearly indicating that HST- 10 has a jet. We postulate that the orientation of HST- 10 is determined by the combined ram-pressure of this jet and the FUV-powered <b>photo-ablation</b> flow from the disk surface. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|Here {{we examine}} the {{evolution}} of irradiated clouds using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm coupled with a ray-tracing scheme that calculates {{the position of the}} ionisation-front at each timestep. We present results from simulations performed for three choices of IR-flux spanning the range of fluxes emitted by a typical B-type star to a cluster of OB-type stars. The extent of <b>photo-ablation,</b> of course, depends on the strength of the incident flux and a strong flux of IR severely ablates a MC. Consequently, the first star-formation sites appear in the dense shocked layer along the edges of the irradiated cloud. Radiation-induced turbulence readily generates dense filamentary structure within the photo-ablated cloud although several new star-forming sites also appear in some of the densest regions at the junctions of these filaments. Prevalent physical conditions within a MC {{play a crucial role in}} determining the mode, i. e., filamentary as compared to isolated pockets, of star-formation, the timescale on which stars form and the distribution of stellar masses. The probability density functions (PDFs) derived for irradiated clouds in this study are intriguing due to their resemblance with those presented in a recent census of irradiated MCs. Furthermore, irrespective of the nature of turbulence, the protostellar mass-functions(MFs) derived in this study follow a power-law distribution. When turbulence within the cloud is driven by a relatively strong flux of IR such as that emitted by a massive O-type star or a cluster of such stars, the MF approaches the canonical form due to Salpeter, and even turns-over for protostellar masses smaller than ∼ 0. 2 M_.
