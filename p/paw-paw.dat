40|$|Recent {{developments}} in landscape studies and associated fields of research (e. g., cultural geography, place-theory and material culture studies) have been gesturing towards a 'non-representational' account of landscape. Central to such literatures {{is an attempt}} {{to move away from the}} notion that the landscape is some kind of tabula rasa upon which culture inscribes images and iconography, narratives and representations. Whether influenced by Latour's Actor Network Theory, landscape phenomenology, Bachelardean accounts of substances, or the anthropology and sociology of the senses, this line of thinking posits that landscapes are places where we 'dwell', engage in a variety of practical activities and which offer their own distinctive 'affordances' or agential affects. What might this theoretical development mean for sociocultural studies of the tropics? In this paper, I contend that a phenomenological-material account of tropical phenomena can profitably be focused on a quality we might term 'lushness'*. Lushness involves an excessive, if not decadent, amount of something; and tends to suggest voluptuousness, fecundity, density, vividness, an object or ambience that arouses the senses, as well as the sensation of feeling refreshed. Tropical lushness 'affords' various embodied activities from lying on the sand to immersing oneself in water or the taking of cover under dense canopies. Tropical landscapes encourage outdoor-ness and often blur the boundary between inside and outside. In considering the phenomenological-cum-material qualities of the lush, I reflect on four instances: tropical landscaping of gardens and public spaces; the geography and affordances associated with tropical waterfalls; buildings and other structures that take on a 'ruinous' state due to tropical conditions; and the social and culinary life of tropical fruit (e. g., lychees, bananas, mangos, durians, and <b>paw-paws).</b> Drawing on such cases, I will suggest that tropical lushness involves a spectrum of aesthetic and material possibilities ranging from the cultivated to the supposedly 'wild', and that discerning the boundary between the cultural and the natural – in the case of tropical lushness – is no straightforward matter...|$|R

40|$|Horticultural crop {{production}} {{has long been}} recognised {{as a means of}} diversifying the production base of the Gambian economy, for increasing the self-reliance of the country's producers and, very importantly, for improving the food security situation of the country. The Gambia is a small and densely populated country whose urban areas are centred in and around the capital Banjul. Horticultural {{crop production}} is concentrated in this urban region, where there are many community gardens primarily devoted to cool season vegetable production. This industry has been studied by Dr R Fordham and Y B Sarr of Wye College, University of London. The main vegetable crops grown are onions, tomatoes, cabbage and peppers, although some of the older gardens also produce fruit crops including <b>paw-paws,</b> mangoes and citrus. Production is based on community gardens organized and managed by women's groups. The most critical environmental factor affecting crop development is the shortage of water, since production is largely confined to the dry season when plant growth can only be sustained through reliable irrigation. For the most part, gardens depend for their water on relatively shallow, hand-dug wells and therefore sites are located in low-lying areas where the water table is near the surface. Stock-proof fencing is another essential for successful crop production in the region. The women gardeners have become skilled in growing horticultural crops but post-harvest handling, distribution and marketing activities are less well developed. Produce that is surplus to domestic needs finds an outlet through tourist hotels and local markets, but gluts frequently occur and attempts are being made to overcome this problem. One approach has been to stagger production by advancing planting dates, although this has often proved difficult as women are not usually available to start work on their gardens until the completion of the rice harvest. A spread in production could also be achieved by planting a suitable range of early and late cultivars, but this depends heavily on a timely supply of high quality seed. Overall, the gardens make a useful contribution to the country's economy and to the health of its people, and represent an important focus for development.

60|$|Mackintosh {{had slept}} badly {{and he looked}} with distaste at the <b>paw-paw</b> and the eggs and bacon which were set before him. The {{mosquitoes}} had been maddening that night; they flew about the net under which he slept in such numbers that their humming, pitiless and menacing, {{had the effect of}} a note, infinitely drawn out, played on a distant organ, and whenever he dozed off he awoke with a start in the belief that one had found its way inside his curtains. It was so hot that he lay naked. He turned from side to side. And gradually the dull roar of the breakers on the reef, so unceasing and so regular that generally you did not hear it, grew distinct on his consciousness, its rhythm hammered on his tired nerves and he held himself with clenched hands in the effort to bear it. The thought that nothing could stop that sound, for it would continue to all eternity, was almost impossible to bear, and, as though his strength were a match for the ruthless forces of nature, he had an insane impulse to do some violent thing. He felt he must cling to his self-control or he would go mad. And now, looking out of the window at the lagoon and the strip of foam which marked the reef, he shuddered with hatred of the brilliant scene. The cloudless sky was like an inverted bowl that hemmed it in. He lit his pipe and turned over the pile of Auckland papers that had come over from Apia a few days before.
