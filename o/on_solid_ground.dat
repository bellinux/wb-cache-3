5|$|A {{generally}} malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, {{but it is}} also fond of otters, {{of which}} it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs as if <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b> During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
25|$|The Tenderloin borders the Mission/Market Street corridor, {{which follows}} the Spaniards' El Camino Real, {{which in turn}} traced an ancient north/south Indian trail. The Tenderloin is {{sheltered}} by Nob Hill, and far enough from the bay to be <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b> There is evidence that a community resided here several thousand years ago. In the 1960s, the area was excavated to develop the BART/MUNI subway station at Civic Center. During the excavation, {{the remains of a}} woman dated to be 5,000 years old were found.|$|E

25|$|Cassini {{released}} the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004, {{by means of}} a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b> Although Cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from Huygens of its descent and landing site, a software error failed to turn on one of the Cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures. While landing, for caution, NASA loaded Huygens with 3 parachutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Wright brothers' design of a controllable airplane that could fly against a strong wind and land <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground,</b> Langley sought safety by practicing in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.|$|E
25|$|In August {{the balloon}} was {{commissioned}} to fly despite known technical flaws. The commissioners {{emphasized that the}} crew, although equipped with personal parachutes, had few chances of bailing out in case of emergency: the sole airtight hatch was held in place with twelve wing nuts. Opening it, even <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground,</b> required minutes. The crew did not wear pressure suits (they simply did not exist at that time) or individual breathing sets, relying on stored supplies of compressed oxygen and carbon dioxide absorber cartridges. Crew survival depended on the gondola's integrity; bailing out without breathing sets was feasible only at altitudes below 8,000 metres.|$|E

25|$|In 111 Bithynia et Pontus {{was known}} for being in disorder, and Pliny was {{selected}} by Trajan because of his legal training and his past experience. Pliny {{was familiar with the}} region, having defended two of their proconsuls for extortion in the Senate, one case being around AD 103. However, Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians, and thus consulted Trajan in order to be <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> regarding his actions, and saved his letters and Trajan's replies. The way he expressed his lack of familiarity with the procedure may indicate that such prosecutions against Christians had taken place before (namely in Rome), but Pliny had not been involved in them.|$|E
25|$|In France {{during the}} chaotic {{years of the}} French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon {{grew up to be}} a {{handsome}} and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} intention for Gemini was to land <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> {{instead of}} at sea, using a Rogallo wing {{rather than a}} parachute, with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft. To facilitate this, the airfoil did not attach just to {{the nose of the}} craft, but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield. This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches. This design was ultimately dropped, and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury. The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal, so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first. This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule.|$|E
30|$|The lack of such {{analyses}} {{is significant}} because quantifying predictability provides a rigorous framework to compare theories of decision-making. Indeed, if we formalize theories into models and compare their predictive power, the most plausible theory will be, in general, the one that makes the most accurate predictions [11, 12]. Similarly, given a simple model that we aim to refine and improve, the refinements should increase predictability; otherwise, {{they ought to be}} revised or discarded [11]. All in all, studying the predictive power of theories and models opens the door to advance our understanding of human behavior <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>grounds</b> [11].|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} Faddeev Popov gauge fixing {{procedure is}} put <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>grounds</b> by {{taking into account}} a topological factor which corrects {{for the number of}} Gribov copies within the first Gribov horizon. Zwanziger’s stochastic approach to gauge fixed Yang-Mills theory is briefly reviewed. A simple toy model is presented which illustrates both methods. Within the toy model, I show that a stochastic drift force can be constructed with which the gauged configurations are attracted by the fundamental modular region. The toy model shows that an action which gives rise to the drift force can be found. This makes a “heat bath ” simulation possible, which is seen to be superior to the Langevin approach at the numerical level...|$|R
500|$|The name Tiktaalik is an Inuktitut {{word meaning}} [...] "burbot", a {{freshwater}} fish related to true cod. The [...] "fishapod" [...] genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae cryptically honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed {{look at the}} internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> and breathe air, a key intermediate step in {{the transformation of the}} skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors.|$|E
500|$|For {{almost two}} months, Shackleton {{and his party}} camped on a large, flat floe, hoping that it would drift towards Paulet Island, {{approximately}} [...] away, where it was known that stores were cached. After failed attempts to march across the ice to this island, Shackleton decided to set up another more permanent camp (Patience Camp) on another floe, and trust to the drift of the ice to take them towards a safe landing. By 17 March, their ice camp was within [...] of Paulet Island but, separated by impassable ice, {{they were unable to}} reach it. On 9 April, their ice floe broke into two, and Shackleton ordered the crew into the lifeboats, to head for the nearest land. After five harrowing days at sea, the exhausted men landed their three lifeboats at Elephant Island, [...] from where the Endurance sank. This was the first time they had stood <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> for 497 days. Shackleton's concern for his men was such that he gave his mittens to photographer Frank Hurley, who had lost his during the boat journey. Shackleton suffered frostbitten fingers as a result.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a formal}} protest lodged on 9 December, Grey {{declared}} that [...] "while the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty left the United States free {{to build and}} protect the canal, it expressly maintained the principle of Article VIII of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850, guaranteeing to England {{the use of the}} canal on a complete equality with the United States of America." [...] On 27 February 1913 he pressed for arbitration. In the United States, the British contention was generally regarded as an attempt to interfere with the United States' sovereign rights to regulate its own commerce, and to use the canal in whatsoever manner it saw fit. A minority, led by Republican Senator Elihu Root, held that the British objection was based <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R

2500|$|For several reasons, a {{different}} landing system {{was chosen for}} MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. Curiosity was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems. It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover's instruments. This would have required long landing legs that would need to have significant width to keep {{the center of gravity}} low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent Curiosity from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane. The sky crane system lowered the rover with a [...] tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and an electrical cable carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover's six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly [...] below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was <b>on</b> <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyros (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage flew away to a crash landing [...] away. The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.|$|E
