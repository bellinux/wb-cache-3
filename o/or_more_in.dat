5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 hours <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the umu tī pit. Steaming {{converted the}} carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry {{until the time}} came to add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|As QPR {{were in the}} Third Division {{they played}} one more round than Albion who {{received}} a bye in the first round. Therefore, QPR progressed through six rounds to reach the final, whereas Albion progressed through five. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis {{with the exception of}} the semi-finals which were contested over two-legs, with a match at each team's home ground. QPR's matches were generally close affairs, they only won by a three two goal margin <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> three of their matches. Albion's matches were almost all comfortable victories. Their biggest margin of victory was five goals when they beat Aston Villa 6–1. While the only match did not win was the second leg of the semi-final against West Ham United, which was drawn 2–2.|$|E
5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
50|$|West Virginia {{finished}} {{the season in}} a three-way tie for the Big East title, but earned the conference's BCS bid since it was the highest-ranked team in the final BCS rankings.

5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL's {{decision}} to lock out the players {{at the start}} of the 2012–13 season until a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached, Johansen was reassigned to the Blue Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. On February 24, 2013, Johansen was re-called by the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season, which began on January 19 after an agreement was reached. In the 2013–14 season, Johansen had a break-out year, scoring 33 goals and 30 assists for a total of 63 points, a career high. He was the third Blue Jacket in franchise history to post 30 goals <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> one season.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; {{he also noted that}} subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of the}} femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E
