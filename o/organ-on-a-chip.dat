50|$|Uwe Marx (born 26 June 1964 in Berlin) is a German {{physician}} and biotechnologist, {{and is one}} of the world's leading researchers in the fields of <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> technology and antibody production. In 1989, he planned to recreate organs like liver, lung, or skin in vitro and to mimic organ functions and interactions outside a living organism. He was initially able to develop a human artificial lymph node model (in vitro) for immunogenicity tests. Since 2007, Marx has been working together with other scientists to reproduce the human organism on a microfluidic chip at a scale of 1:100,000. The aim is to shorten the entire drug development process as well as to reduce animal experiments and drug testing in humans during clinical trials. These microfluidic devices can also be used to test other substances (e.g. chemicals, cosmetic ingredients) for their safety and efficacy.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{his more}} recent {{innovations}} is a microfabrication method for building tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs. These [...] "organs-on-chips," [...] which mimic complicated human organ functions, are being designed to replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and toxins. The first human <b>organ-on-a-chip,</b> the human [...] "lung-on-a-chip", was reported in Science in 2010. Created using microchip manufacturing methods, the lung-on-a-chip is a complex three-dimensional model of a breathing lung that incorporates living human lung cells within microfluidic channels in silicone rubber. In 2012, Ingber and his team demonstrated in a study in Science Translational Medicine the ability to mimic a complex human disease on the lung-on-a-chip — specifically pulmonary edema, known commonly as “fluid on the lungs” — and to identify new therapeutics using this model. As an alternative to animal studies, the lung-on-a-chip {{could be used to}} study the safety and efficacy of new drugs, accelerating the introduction of new drugs to market while significantly lowering research costs. Ingber’s group extended this technology to develop a human gut-on-a-chip that undergoes peristalsis and supports growth of a living microbiome, a kidney tubule on a chip that mimics drug toxicities, as well as a bone marrow-on-a-chip that reconstitutes a full hematopoietic niche. In 2012, Ingber’s team was awarded a DARPA contract to string together ten organs-on-chips to build an automated human body-on-chips that will recapitulate whole-body physiology. This instrumented [...] "human body-on-a-chip" [...] could be used in combination with computational modeling to rapidly assess responses to new drug candidates, providing critical information on their safety and efficacy.|$|E

While chips fea-turing single organs can be of great use for both pharmaceutical testing and basic organ-level studies, the huge potential of the <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> technology is revealed by connect-ing multiple organs on one chip to create a single integrated system for sophisticated funda-mental biological studies and devising therapies for disease. Furthermore, since most <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> systems require special protocols with organ-specific media for the differ-entiation and maturation of the tissues, multi-organ systems {{will need to be}} temporally cus-tomizable and flexible in terms of the time point of connection of the individual organ units.

Multiple organoid models may be further connected together through the microfluidics in a similar manner in which they are arranged in vivo, providing the capability to analyze multiorgan interactions. Although a wide variety of human <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> models have been created, there are limited efforts on the integration of multisensor systems. However, in situ continual measuring is critical in precise assessment of the microenvironment parameters and the dynamic responses of the organs to pharmaceutical compounds over extended periods of time.

Here, we report a fully integrated modular physical, biochemical, and optical sensing platform through a fluidics-routing breadboard, which operates <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> units in a continual, dynamic, and automated manner.

40|$|<b>Organ-on-a-chip</b> {{engineering}} aims {{to create}} artificial living organs that mimic {{the complex and}} physiological responses of real organs, {{in order to test}} drugs by precisely manipulating the cells and their microenvironments. To achieve this, the artificial organs should to be microfabricated with an extracellular matrix (ECM) and various types of cells, and should recapitulate morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and functions according to the native organ. A promising strategy is 3 D printing, which precisely controls the spatial distribution and layer-by-layer assembly of cells, ECMs, and other biomaterials.

40|$|Organ-on a-chip {{technology}} {{is becoming a}} popular method for drug testing. Microfluidic <b>Organ-on-a-chip</b> {{eliminates the need for}} live objects, such as animals, to do drug testing. Although the <b>Organ-on-a-chip</b> devices are becoming popular, creating a microfluidic device to represent human placenta is more challenging than other organs. Current drug testing methods are considered unethical and unreliable due to drug testing on animals and cost. The human placenta is a temporary organ created during pregnancy to connect fetus and its mother to allow nutrient supply, gas exchange, waste elimination, and avoid internal infections. Researchers wanted to study how the two-way traffic reacts when it’s blocked by bacteria/viruses while it transfers the nutrients/ oxygen, since the lack of transportation can affect the health of the mother and the fetus. When animal organs are used for testing on the human placenta, inconsistent results have been found due to the differences among species in physiological functions of human placental barrier, including permeability, transport of supplements, patterns of blood flow, and even in metabolic activities. Our “Placenta-on-a-chip” device is designed to represent a working placenta organ using human cells in order to imitate the nutrient/waste transfer between the maternal blood and fetal blood. HUVEC cells (endothelial) and BeWo cells (trophoblast) were used to represent the placental barrier with a high concentrated collagen coated membrane. The objective is to analyze the glucose transport between the endothelial-trophoblast barrier through the membrane. In the future, researchers {{will have the opportunity to}} use the placenta-on-a-chip model for additional research in drug testing. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is a useful method to study the performance of the cell growth in <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> devices.

40|$|Cancer ranks {{amongst the}} most lethal {{diseases}} worldwide, {{partly due to}} there being more than 120 different types of cancer, each one different from the other. Even for cancers from the same organ, different mutations in different cells within the same tissue can give rise to different types of cancer, which may require completely different treatments. Due to advancements in medical and pharmacological sciences, different drug regiments for different types of cancer exist, which has contributed to improving the survival rates for many cancer patients. However, due to inherent patient-to-patient differences in genetic and epigenetic makeup, not every patient responds {{in the same manner}} to the same treatment. To this end, to provide a more comprehensive treatment for cancer patients, scientists and doctors are suggesting personalized medicine as the new paradigm in cancer treatments to tailor drug regiments for each patient. To realize this, drug testing platforms with cells derived from the patient should be used to obtain information about the specific patient’s sensitivity to different drugs. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept ‘you-on-a-chip’ integrated device that utilizes <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> systems to recapitulate the patient’s own physiological state outside of the human body. The <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> devices used here will consist of a ‘cancer-on-a-chip’ device containing the patient’s own cancer cells, integrated with the ‘liver-on-a-chip’, ‘heart-on-a-chip’ and ‘muscle-on-a-chip’ devices. Each chip will contain micro-tissues derived from the same patient’s own induced pluripotent cells. Here in this dissertation, I detail studies leading up to the development of this integrated <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> system, which we propose {{can be used as a}} personalized drug testing platform to tailor patients’ treatments. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as a drug testing platform by pharmaceutical companies to elucidate the most efficacious drug from thousands of drug candidates. Chapter 1 is a literature review focusing on collective migration, diffusion and <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> technology. The first segment focuses on the mechanical regulation of collective migration, from the development of tools that allow us to elucidate these mechanical forces to the modern understanding of the different biological mechanism at play during collective migration. In the second segment, I cover studies that have examined diffusion of matter into cancer in many in vivo and in vitro platforms. Results from these studies show that there are multiple biological and physical barriers that can passively inhibit the diffusion of small molecules into tissue and into cancer cells. Lastly, in the final segment, I cover developments in the <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> field, such as the design and development of many different types of <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> platforms, as well as key studies that demonstrate integration of different organ-on-a-chips. Collective migration is a key biological process that is involved in wound healing, morphogenesis, and cancer metastasis. In Chapter 2, using a protein-patterned platform, my colleagues and I study the mechanical interactions between two attached cells undergoing collective migration. Our results show that the role of the leading cell alternates between the two cells, as the pair migrates along the direction of the leading cell. We have also observed cooperativity between two cells in which the trailing cell mechanically softens itself to allow the leading cell to pull it along. Together, our observations show the two cells engaging in a mechanical “tug-of-war” where the trailing cell actively adjusts its own mechanical malleability to facilitate subtle movements of the cell pair. Diffusion plays a key role in the transport of molecular agents into non-vascularized tumors. Past methods studying this have generalized the diffusivity within tumors by assuming its constant spatially in the tumor. However, recent studies have shown that microenvironmental factors, such as extracellular matrix rigidity, can play a role in affecting growth and packing within tumors, which we hypothesize can affect the spatial variation of diffusivity in the tumor. In chapter 3, I utilized a cancer-on-a-chip device as a platform to quantify the spatial variations in the diffusivity of a spheroid encapsulated within gelatin methacrylate hydrogels of different rigidities. Our results show that substrates of different rigidities can impact the diffusion of small molecules in the deepest regions of cancer spheroids, which may affect the efficacy of drugs administered. Chapter 4 describes integrating the simplified cancer-on-a-chip device into an integrated system comprising cancerous, muscle, heart and liver tissues. Such platforms can be used to understand tissue-tissue or even organ-organ cross talk. They can also be used measure off-target side effects of anti-cancer agents on humans, thereby allowing us to bypass animal models to obtain more clinically relevant drug efficacy results. Here we show that we can build different organs in different devices, and then integrate them in a modular manner while sustaining viability in them for short periods of time. Our results also demonstrate the continual functionality of these organs through this time...|$|E

40|$|Continual {{monitoring}} of secreted biomarkers from <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> models is desired {{to understand their}} responses to drug exposure in a noninvasive manner. To achieve this goal, analytical methods capable of monitoring trace amounts of secreted biomarkers are of particular interest. However, a majority of existing biosensing techniques suffer from limited sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and require large working volumes, especially when cell culture medium is involved, which usually contains a plethora of nonspecific binding proteins and interfering compounds. Hence, novel analytical platforms are needed to provide noninvasive, accurate information {{on the status of}} organoids at low working volumes. Here, we report a novel microfluidic aptamer-based electrochemical biosensing platform for monitoring damage to cardiac organoids. The system is scalable, low-cost, and compatible with microfluidic platforms easing its integration with microfluidic bioreactors. To create the creatine kinase (CK) -MB biosensor, the microelectrode was functionalized with aptamers that are specific to CK-MB biomarker secreted from a damaged cardiac tissue. Compared to antibody-based sensors, the proposed aptamer-based system was highly sensitive, selective, and stable. The performance of the sensors was assessed using a heart-on-a-chip system constructed from human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes following exposure to a cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin. The aptamer-based biosensor was capable of measuring trace amounts of CK-MB secreted by the cardiac organoids upon drug treatments in a dose-dependent manner, which was in agreement with the beating behavior and cell viability analyses. We believe that, our microfluidic electrochemical biosensor using aptamer-based capture mechanism will find widespread applications in integration with <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> platforms for in situ detection of biomarkers at low abundance and high sensitivity...|$|E

Additionally, this book will show that although the US is still in a leadership position in stem cell engineering, Asian countries such as Japan, China and Korea, as well as European countries like the UK, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are rapidly expanding their investments in the field. Strategic partnerships between countries could lead to major advances of the field and scalable expansion and differentiation of stem cells.

40|$|The {{development}} of precise microdevices {{can be applied}} to the reconstruction of in vitro human microenvironmental systems with biomimetic physiological conditions that have highly tunable spatial and temporal features. <b>Organ-on-a-chip</b> can emulate human physiological functions, particularly at the organ level, as well as its specific roles in the body. Due to the complexity of the structure of the central nervous system and its intercellular interaction, there remains an urgent need for the {{development of}} human brain or nervous system models. Thus, various microdevice models have been proposed to mimic actual human brain physiology, which can be categorized as nervous system-on-a-chip. Nervous system-on-a-chip platforms can prove to be promising technologies, through the application of their biomimetic features to the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the microdevices for nervous system-on-a-chip platform incorporated with neurobiology and microtechnology, including microfluidic designs that are biomimetic to the entire nervous system. The emulation of both neurodegenerative disorders and neural stem cell behavior patterns in micro-platforms is also provided, which can be used as a basis to construct nervous system-on-a-chip...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an aqueous electrolytic nonNewtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An analytical approach is adopted {{to obtain the}} closed form solution for velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption and lubrication theory approximations. Debye-Hückel linearization (i. e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) is also considered. Streamline plots are also presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is shown {{to be more sensitive}} to an electric field (aiding, opposing and neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help towards the design of <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> like devices for better drug design...|$|E
40|$|A {{plethora of}} 3 D and microfluidics-based culture {{models have been}} {{demonstrated}} {{in the recent years}} with the ultimate aim to facilitate predictive in vitro models for pharmaceutical development. This article summarizes to date the progress in the microfluidics-based tissue culture models, including <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> and vasculature-on-a-chip. Specific focus is placed on addressing the question of what kinds of 3 D culture and system complexities are deemed desirable by the biological and biomedical community. This question is addressed through analysis of a research survey to evaluate the potential use of microfluidic cell culture models among the end users. Our results showed a willingness to adopt 3 D culture technology among biomedical researchers, although a significant gap still exists between the desired systems and existing 3 D culture options. With these results, key challenges and future directions are highlighted.

40|$|Abstract: Cell {{adhesion}} {{is essential}} in cell communication and regulation, and is of fundamental importance {{in the development and}} maintenance of tissues. The mechanical interactions between a cell and its extracellular matrix (ECM) can influence and control cell behavior and function. The essential function of cell adhesion has created tremendous interests in developing methods for measuring and studying cell adhesion properties. The study of cell adhesion could be categorized into cell adhesion attachment and detachment events. The study of cell adhesion has been widely explored via both events for many important purposes in cellular biology, biomedical, and engineering fields. Cell adhesion attachment and detachment events could be further grouped into the cell population and single cell approach. Various techniques to measure cell adhesion have been applied to many fields of study in order to gain understanding of cell signaling pathways, biomaterial studies for implantable sensors, artificial bone and tooth replacement, the development of tissue-on-a-chip and <b>organ-on-a-chip</b> in tissue engineering, the effects of biochemical treatments and environmental stimuli to the cell adhesion, the potential of drug treatments, cancer metastasis study, and the determination of the adhesion propertie...|$|E
