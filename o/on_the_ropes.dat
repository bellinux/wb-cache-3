5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E

5|$|On the May 7, 1995 (taped April 26, 1995) {{episode of}} WWF Action Zone, Holly pinned WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in a title match, but as Jarrett had his foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> the {{decision}} was overturned and the title vacated. Later on in the show, Jarrett defeated Holly in a rematch for the vacant title after pinning Holly with a roll-up. Holly's title win is not recognized by WWE. Holly then competed in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Mantaur to qualify before losing to The Roadie in the quarterfinals. He was then the first WWF pay-per-view opponent of Hunter Hearst Helmsley, losing to him at SummerSlam. At Survivor Series, Holly {{was a part of}} the Underdogs team along with Marty Jannetty, Hakushi and Barry Horowitz. They were defeated by the Body Donnas team of Skip, Tom Prichard, Rad Radford and The 1-2-3 Kid.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee {{what had happened and}} the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when {{he was able to}} execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified for hitting him with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E

5|$|Cotto's next {{fight was}} on December 1, 2012, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His {{opponent}} was the undefeated WBA Super Welterweight Champion Austin Trout. Trout started the fight off fast, using his quick combinations to continually get his punches off first against Cotto. Trout also used his superior footwork to evade most of Cotto's punches, {{and was able}} to out muscle Cotto off the ropes when he was cornered in the fight. During the middle rounds, Cotto found success trapping Trout <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> and keeping him there, ripping Trout with body shots and finding the range with his left hook. Trout regained control in the later rounds, even backing Cotto up later in the fight, and stunned Cotto several times down the stretch with his straight left hand. Trout won the fight by a wide unanimous decision, giving him the biggest win of his career thus far. The judges scores were 117-111, 117-111, 119-109. Trout landed 238 of 779 punches (31%) and Cotto landed 183 of 628 punches thrown (29%). After the fight, Trout called out fellow light middleweight champion Canelo √Ålvarez. The fight averaged averaged 1.047 million and peaked at 1.4 million viewers, which set a record for Showtime boxing.|$|E
5|$|Hardy gained {{attention}} for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches, making {{a name for}} himself {{as one of the most}} seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Van Dam on two separate occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led to Matt demanding a match at Vengeance, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt by pinfall at Vengeance, while Matt's foot was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match and lost. After the match, The Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker attacked Matt as well, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble, because WWF did not have another storyline for their characters. The Hardys later came back as a team, and there was never any mention of their previous storyline split.|$|E
5|$|In March, Melina {{was placed}} in an angle where she became jealous of SmackDown! Diva Ashley Massaro, who was {{receiving}} attention because of her appearance in Playboy. The angle had Melina claim in her blogs that no Playboy cover models were capable of fighting her. This resulted in scheduled matches against former Playboy cover girls Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle, with both women losing to Melina. The storyline {{came to an end}} at WrestleMania 23, where Melina pinned Ashley in a Lumberjill match to retain her Women's Championship. After WrestleMania, Melina organized a photo op with the Women's Championship belt in the ring, but was interrupted by Mickie James, resulting in another storyline feud between the two Divas. On April 24, at a house show in Paris, France, Melina lost the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match to James when James pinned Victoria, but on the orders of Jonathan Coachman, she was entitled to a rematch on the same night, where she pinned James by putting her hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> to regain the title and become a two-time WWE Women's Champion.|$|E

5|$|In her 15th {{professional}} bout, Kentikian {{fought for}} her first world championship in Cologne, Germany, on February 16, 2007; it was also her first time headlining a fight card. She won by a ninth round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of Venezuela, thereby winning the vacant WBA Flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches {{in most of the}} rounds and was bleeding heavily from her nose and the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health. Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the K√∂lnarena, she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian Stefan Raab and WIBF World Champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat Mar√≠a Jos√© N√∫√±ez from Uruguay with a third round technical knockout. N√∫√±ez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight one round later with a right cross followed up by combinations that left N√∫√±ez defenseless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> causing the referee to step in.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E
5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E

5|$|This {{match was}} {{followed}} by the Tag Team Championship match. The match started slowly, but both teams soon began brawling in the ring. The Harts focused on Pierre, but Jacques was eventually able to tag in to rescue him. After Pierre regained the advantage, Owen tagged in and took control of the match. He applied the Sharpshooter to Jacques, but Pierre broke the hold. Bret tagged in but fell out of the ring and kayfabe hurt his knee when the Quebecers' manager pulled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> The Quebecers focused on Bret's knee until Bret regained the advantage and attempted to apply the Sharpshooter. He was not able to stand, however, so the referee stopped the match and awarded the victory to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen yelled at Bret for not tagging out of the match. He then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring.|$|E
5|$|On the January 5, 2012 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne {{retained}} their tag team titles against James and Traci Brooks. Three days later at Genesis, Kim defeated James by disqualification {{to retain the}} Knockouts Championship. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Kim successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Tara, during which Madison Rayne walked out on her Knockouts Tag Team Championship partner. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Rayne won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Kim's Knockouts Championship. In the following weeks, tension between Kim and Rayne began to be teased with the two negatively interfering in each other's matches. On the March 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Eric Young and ODB. On March 18 at Victory Road, Kim successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Rayne. On the March 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne reconciled and remained together as a team. On April 15 at Lockdown, Kim defeated Velvet Sky in a steel cage match, following a distraction from Rayne, to retain her title. Afterwards, Kim went on a losing streak against Brooke Tessmacher, which led to TNA naming Tessmacher the number one contender to her title. On May 13 at Sacrifice, Kim defeated Tessmacher, pinning her with her feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> for another successful title defense. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim successfully defended her title against Tessmacher and Velvet Sky in a three-way match.
