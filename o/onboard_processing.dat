40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{rationale}} for increasing the rate of information return from imaging class experiments aboard both terrestrial and planetary spacecraft. Future imaging systems will be designed with increased spatial resolution, broader spectral range and more spectral channels (or higher spectral resolution). The data rate implied by these improved performance characteristics {{can be expected to}} grow more rapidly than the projected telecommunications capability. One solution to this dilemma is the use of improved <b>onboard</b> data <b>processing.</b> The use of <b>onboard</b> classification <b>processing</b> in a multispectral imager can result in orders of magnitude increase in information transfer for very specific types of imaging tasks.

50|$|Active marker {{systems can}} further be refined by {{strobing}} one marker on at a time, or tracking multiple markers {{over time and}} modulating the amplitude or pulse width to provide marker ID. 12 megapixel spatial resolution modulated systems show more subtle movements than 4 megapixel optical systems by having both higher spatial and temporal resolution. Directors can see the actors performance in real time, and watch the results on the motion capture driven CG character. The unique marker IDs reduce the turnaround, by eliminating marker swapping and providing much cleaner data than other technologies. LEDs with <b>onboard</b> <b>processing</b> and a radio synchronization allow motion capture outdoors in direct sunlight, while capturing at 120 to 960 frames per second due to a high speed electronic shutter. Computer processing of modulated IDs allows less hand cleanup or filtered results for lower operational costs. This higher accuracy and resolution requires more processing than passive technologies, but the additional processing is done at the camera to improve resolution via a subpixel or centroid processing, providing both high resolution and high speed. These motion capture systems are typically $20,000 for an eight camera, 12 megapixel spatial resolution 120 hertz system with one actor.|$|E

40|$|Our {{approach}} to <b>onboard</b> <b>processing</b> will enable a quicker return and improved quality of processed data from small, remote-sensing satellites. We describe an intelligent payload concept which processes RF lightning signal data onboard the spacecraft in a power-aware manner. Presently, <b>onboard</b> <b>processing</b> is severely curtailed {{due to the}} conventional management of limited resources and power-unaware payload designs. Delays of days to weeks are commonly experienced before raw data is received, processed into a human-usable format, and finally transmitted to the end-user. We enable this resource-critical technology of <b>onboard</b> <b>processing</b> through the concept of Algorithm Power Modulation (APM). APM is a decision process used to execute a specific software algorithm, from a suite of possible algorithms, {{to make the best}} use of the available power. The suite of software algorithms chosen for our application is intended to reduce the probability of false alarms through postprocessing. Each algorithm however also has a cost in energy usage. A heuristic decision tree procedure is used which selects an algorithm based on the available power, time allocated, algorithm priority, and algorithm performance. We demonstrate our {{approach to}} power-aware <b>onboard</b> <b>processing</b> through a preliminary software simulation...|$|E
