5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> around Italy and Rome but other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E

5|$|The main {{mining regions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> were the Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive {{large-scale}} mining—of alluvial deposits, and {{by means of}} open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> disrupted production. The gold mines of Dacia, for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Though {{usually made}} to {{strengthen}} the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire,</b> there are examples of interdynastic marriages destabilising the emperor's authority. When Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos married his second wife, Eirene of Montferrat, in 1284 she caused a division in the Empire over her demand that her own sons share in imperial territory with, Michael, his son from his first marriage. She resorted to leaving Constantinople, {{the capital of the}} Byzantine Empire, and setting up her own court in the second city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empire,</b> Thessalonica.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{increasing}} trouble and decline {{began with the}} reign of Commodus. Commodus' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors, of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty-year time span. It {{was not until the}} reign of Diocletian that the empire was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy, which saw four emperors rule the empire at once. This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine the Great, who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> in 324. Constantine subsequently established a second capital city in Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople. It remained the capital of the east until its demise. Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire.</b> Following the death of Theodosius I in 395, the empire was permanently divided between the West and the East. The dominion of the Western Roman Empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian migrations and invasions, military reforms and economic depression. The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire's decay, while the deposition of the emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 by Odoacer, is generally accepted to mark the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> in the west. However, Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague, and separate rule in the Western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire</b> only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos, in 480. The Eastern Roman Empire (in modern historiography called the Byzantine Empire) endured for another millennium as one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch-rival the Sassanid Empire, which had inherited a centuries-old Roman-Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians. It eventually fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.|$|E
5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>empire,</b> just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius. Germanicus survived {{a little over a}} year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E
