40|$|The {{exchange}} kinetics of <b>octylamine</b> {{between a}} free {{state and a}} state bound {{to the surface of}} CdSe quantum dots is analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solution. On the basis of 1 D 1 H and DOSY and NOESY spectroscopy, we find that all <b>octylamine</b> molecules present interact with the CdSe quantum dot surface, although the <b>octylamine</b> resonances and diffusion coefficient resemble those of free <b>octylamine.</b> This indicates that these NMR observables are a weighted average of a free and a bound state, implying that the overall <b>octylamine</b> exchange rate is fast as compared to the intrinsic NMR time scale.

40|$|Xanthan is a {{polysaccharide}} {{widely used}} in food, cosmetics, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by polymer flooding. In polymer flooding addition of polymers increases the viscosity of the injection water used for oil extraction from the oil producing wells. It is desirable {{to take advantage of}} biopolymers in EOR, due to their biodegradability and easily accessible raw materials of low costs. By hydrophobically modifying xanthan the thickening properties may be improved, due to intra- and intermolecular interactions between hydrophobic side groups. In this master thesis xanthan was hydrophobically modified by grafting of <b>octylamine</b> using carbodiimide chemistry, applying a method adopted from the University of Le Havre, France. Properties of non-modified and modified xanthan samples prepared from two different start xanthans, from Kelco and Statoil, were studied by SEC-MALLS, intrinsic viscosity measurements, and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. In order to obtain xanthan molecules of a size suitable for these analysis methods, sonication was performed. Xanthan samples were sonicated for different times, and an obvious decreasing trend of the molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity as the sonication time increased was shown. Intrinsic viscosity dependence on molecular weight was in good accordance to previous reported results. Depolymerisation by H 2 O 2 and NaOH prior to 1 H-NMR analysis did not have the desirable effect on degradation of xanthan chains. The side groups were cut off, rather than breaking the &# 946;- 1, 4 bonds between the glucose units in the xanthan backbone. By comparing the grafting density of <b>octylamine</b> for an acetyl and pyruvyl free xanthan sample and xanthan samples with these groups intact, it was shown {{for the first time that}} more than half of the <b>octylamine</b> binds to the carboxylic acid of the pyruvyl group on the &# 946;-D-mannose of xanthan. Intrinsic viscosity determined by a single capillary viscometer was higher for modified xanthan than non-modified, while by a four-bulb shear dilution viscometer the opposite was shown. The intrinsic viscosity was shown to be dependent on shear rate by the four-bulb viscometer, and the intrinsic viscosities at zero shear for non-modified and modified xanthan was significantly higher than that determined by single capillary viscometer. </p...|$|E

40|$|Formation of {{emulsions}} during {{oil production}} and processing is a costly problem, both {{in term of}} chemicals used and production losses. The traditional ways of breaking emulsion using heat and chemicals are disadvantageous from both economic and environmental prospective. In this thesis, a new natural demulsifier knowing as “Cocamine MEA” {{in addition to an}} alternative energy potentials of microwave-assisted chemical approach were utilized and investigated in the demulsification of water-in-crude oil emulsion. Two types of crude oils were used, namely; crude oils A, and B. The study begun with some characterization studies to provide understanding of fundamental issues such as formation and characterization of the emulsion upon which further development on demulsification process could be achieved. The aim was to evaluate the performance of the new natural demulsifier compare with the existing demulsfiers as well as to obtain an optimized operating conditions of the demulsification process. For the stability performance test, three non-ionic emulsifiers were used, namely; Triton X- 100, Span 80, and Cocamide DEA. Among these emulsifiers, Span 80 and Cocamide DEA permit the highest stability for the prepared emulsion. For the chemical demulsification performance test, six emulsifiers having different properties were utilized, namely: <b>Octylamine,</b> Hexylamine, Dioctylamine, Cocamine MEA, Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 600), and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 1000). Among these demulsifiers, <b>Octylamine</b> was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by Hexylamine (80 - 90 %) for emulsion based on Span 80 at different phase ratios, respectively. Meanwhile, Cocamine MEA at the dose of 1 vol. % was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by <b>Octylamine</b> and Hexylamine (90 - 100 %) at the dose of 1. 5 vol. % for emulsion based on Cocamide DEA at different phase ratios. However, Dioctylamine, PEG 1000, and PEG 600 promote the monophase separation in separating the emulsion. Optimization of the microwave-assisted chemical demulsification using Face Centered Central Composite Design (FCCCD) under Response Surface Methodology found that <b>Octylamine</b> (1. 5 vol. %) promotes a superior effect on demulsification rate of different types of emulsion, the exposure time (0. 5 - 8) minutes and the MW power (270 - 360) watt were the most significant factors at different types of emulsion that consist with lower demulsifier utility, crude oil A emulsions needed higher MW power to separate the two phases. Based on the optimum conditions, the demulsification rate was accelerated by achieving a complete water separation for most types of emulsions. Characterizing the microwave generation and absorption at the optimum conditions showed that the w/o emulsion heated uniformly and deeply by long microwaves with less energy consumption. Results obtained in this thesis have exposed the potential application of Cocamine MEA as a natural composite for demulsification the water-in-crude oil emulsion. Moreover, results proved the capability of microwave-assisted chemical technology in developing the demulsification of w/o emulsions.

Magnetic {{metal and}} metal oxide {{nanoparticles}} capped with alkylamines have been syn-thesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy disper-sive X-ray analysis and magnetization measurements. Core-shell Pd–Ni particles with composition, Pd 561 Ni 3000, (diameter 3. 3 nm) are superparamagnetic at 5 K and organize themselves into two-dimensional crystalline arrays. Similar arrays are obtained with Pd 561 Ni 3000 Pd 1500 nanoparticles containing an additional Pd shell. Magnetic spinel particles of γ-Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 of av-erage diameters in the 4 – 6 nm range coated with <b>octylamine</b> are all supermagnetic at room tempera-ture and yield close-packed disordered arrays. Relatively regular arrays are formed by dodecylamine-capped Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (8. 6 nm diameter) while well-ordered hexagonal arrays were obtained with octylamine-covered Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles (4. 2 nm diameter) ...|$|E
40|$|Biomimetic dopamine-conjugated polyaspartamides as novel {{adhesive}} {{materials were}} synthesized and characterized. These modified polyaspartamides contain three different groups combined with dopamine (DOPA), i. e., γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), ethanolamine (EA) and <b>octylamine</b> (OA), which {{are referred to}} as PolyAspAm (DOPA/GABA), PolyAspAm(DOPA/EA) and PolyAspAm(DOPA/OA), respectively. These three water-swollen polymer glues show good adhesion (0. 1 ~ 0. 4 MPa) with various daily-life materials (aluminum foil, glass and paper) as well as some plastic substrates (PET and PMMA). Compared to the polymers with more hydrophilic groups (GABA and EA), the polymer glue with the hydrophobic alkyl group (OA) exhibited higher adhesive strength values on most substrates. In addition, when applied to biological porcine skin, these glues demonstrated adhesion of values of 15 ~ 20 kPa with EA- and OA-conjugated polymers. These results suggest the great potential of dopamine-modified polyaspartamides as versatile and efficient polymeric glues for industrial and biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the photoelectrochemical {{processes}} occurring in composites formed of organic-capped CdS nanocrystals and {{low molecular weight}} poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 ′-ethyl-exyloxy) phenylene vinylene] conjugated polymer were investigated. High quality colloidal CdS nanoparticles were synthesized by means of thermal decomposition of suitable precursors in non coordinating solvents, using oleic acid as surface capping agent. The absorption and emission properties of the prepared heterojunctions were studied both in solutions and in composite films. The dispersed hybrids were also investigated as photoactive materials, focusing on the photoinduced charge transfer and recombination processes at the interface between the two components. The composites have shown {{a fundamental role in}} photoelectrochemical applications due to the presence of a great number of interfaces able to enhance the charge transfer between mixture components. Blend solutions prepared with <b>octylamine</b> capped CdS nanocrystals showed an improvement of the photoconductivity with respect to hybrids containing longer oleate surfactants...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{two types of}} isocyanate side chain containing copolymers, poly(methyl methacrylate-co-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate) (P(MMA-co-IEM)) and poly(benzyl methacrylate-co-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate) (P(BnMA-co-IEM)), which were synthesized by Cu(0) -mediated radical polymerization, is reported. Polymerization proceeded to high conversion giving polymers of relatively narrow molar mass distributions. The incorporation of the bulky aromatic groups in the latter copolymer rendered it sufficiently stable toward hydrolysis and enabled {{the isolation of the}} product and its characterization by 1 H and 13 C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy and SEC. Both P(MMA-co-IEM) and P(BnMA-co-IEM) were functionalized with dibutylamine, <b>octylamine,</b> and (R) -(1) -a-methylbenzyl-amine, which further proved the successful incorporation of the isocyanate groups. Furthermore, P(BnMA-co-IEM) was used for the fabrication of liquid core microcapsules via oil-in-water interfacial polymerization with diethylenetriamine as crosslinker. The particles obtained were in the size range of 10 – 90 mm in diameter independent of the composition of copolyme...|$|E
