The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E

The remaining statues, urns, and other carvings on the exterior were removed in 1976–77 due to rain damage. It was completely refurbished in the 1990s and exterior restoration required replacement of some 180 sculptural elements, including the allegorical figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtues,</b> giant vases, window embrasures and one of the columns.

5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtues,</b> giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

25|$|Federico was {{succeeded by}} his son Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, who married Elisabetta Gonzaga, {{daughter}} of the ruler of Mantua, the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts. Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture. Growing up {{in the circle of}} this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by Vasari. Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of the Italian humanist court through Baldassare Castiglione's depiction of it in his classic work The Book of the Courtier, published in 1528. Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends. He became close to other regular visitors to the court: Pietro Bibbiena and Pietro Bembo, both later cardinals, were already becoming well known as writers, and would be in Rome during Raphael's period there. Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career. He did not receive a full humanistic education however; it is unclear how easily he read Latin.|$|E

An {{attempt at}} {{understanding}} <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> cnota (<b>virtue)</b> over <b>the</b> centuries The article {{is devoted to}} <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish lexeme cnota (<b>virtue)</b> starting from <b>the</b> Old Polish to the present time. The starting point is the change in <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lexeme <b>virtue</b> from <b>the</b> ‘complex <b>of</b> ethical qualities’ in the Old Polish language to the ‘hymen’ in the twentieth century. From <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish language, <b>the</b> lexeme <b>virtue</b> contained a different catalogue of values in relation to men and women. Analysis concerned these meanings which referred to a woman and {{were related to the}} valuation not only <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtue,</b> but also <b>of</b> a woman in general, taking into consideration non-linguistic, social and cultural determinants. The material comes from historical and contemporary Polish language dictionaries. The studies also included <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> lexemes related to <b>the</b> lexem cnota (<b>virtue),</b> such as an adjective cnotliwy (virtuous) or a noun cnotka (would-be virgin, goody-goody), if they concerned <b>the</b> woman‘s <b>virtue.</b> <b>The</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lexeme <b>virtue</b> in relation to a woman was associated with virginity, chastity, considered as a key factor for determining <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> a woman. Such meaning, associated with a positive valuation <b>of</b> <b>virtue</b> persisted until <b>the</b> nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, <b>the</b> broad importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lexeme <b>virtue</b> has fallen into disuse, the meaning has been narrowed to ‘virginity’. Following this, in connection with social and customary changes, <b>the</b> <b>virtue,</b> already as ‘virginity’, lost its traditional high rating in <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> moral values...|$|R
