40|$|International audienceThe clique {{number of}} an undirected graph G is the maximum {{order of a}} {{complete}} subgraph of G and is a well-known lower bound for the chromatic number of G. Every proper k-coloring of G {{may be viewed as}} a homomorphism (an edge-preserving vertex mapping) of G to the complete graph of order k. By considering homomorphisms of <b>oriented</b> graphs (digraphs without cycles of length at most 2), we get a natural notion of (<b>oriented)</b> colorings and <b>oriented</b> chromatic number of <b>oriented</b> graphs. An <b>oriented</b> clique is then an <b>oriented</b> graph whose number of vertices and <b>oriented</b> chromatic number coincide. However, the structure of <b>oriented</b> cliques is much less understood than in the undirected case. In this article, we study the structure of outerplanar and planar <b>oriented</b> cliques. We first provide a list of 11 graphs and prove that an outerplanar graph can be <b>oriented</b> as an <b>oriented</b> clique if and only if it contains one of these graphs as a spanning subgraph. Klostermeyer and MacGillivray conjectured that the order of a planar <b>oriented</b> clique is at most 15, which was later proved by Sen. We show that any planar <b>oriented</b> clique on 15 vertices must contain a particular <b>oriented</b> graph as a spanning subgraph, thus reproving the above conjecture. We also provide tight upper bounds for the order of planar <b>oriented</b> cliques of girth k for all inline image...|$|R
40|$|A graph G has a k-page book {{embedding}} if G can be embedded into a k-page book. The minimum k {{such that}} G has a k-page book embedding {{is the book}} thickness of G, denoted bt(G). Most of the work on this subject has been done for unoriented graphs and <b>oriented</b> acyclic graphs (no directed cycles). In this work we discuss <b>oriented</b> graphs D containing directed cycles by using <b>oriented</b> book embeddings and <b>oriented</b> book thickness, obt(D). To characterize D such that obt(D) = k, we define the class M^k of k-page critical <b>oriented</b> graphs to be all <b>oriented</b> graphs D with obt(D) =k, but for every proper <b>oriented</b> subgraph of D, denoted D', we have that obt(D') < k. Determining M^k for general k is challenging; we narrow {{down the list of}} <b>oriented</b> graphs in M^k for small k. In this work we show complete lists for M^ 1 and for M^ 2 ∩U, where U consists of all strictly dicyclic <b>oriented</b> graphs, that is, <b>oriented</b> graphs containing exactly one <b>oriented</b> cycle, which is a directed cycle.

5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by <b>orienting</b> the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E

Around AD 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top, making Temple 5D-87 one of the three highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This new version created a new <b>orienting</b> axis in the complex, breaking the primary axis associated with the ancient E-Group complex and its relationship with the old solar cult, thus marking a major change in the ceremonial use of the Mundo Perdido complex. It is about this same time that the twin pyramid complex came into use, demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of the city. During the Late Classic, access to the complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures, this included discontinuing the use of the causeway that had linked the complex with the North Acropolis since the Preclassic. A new palace complex was built in the northern section of the Mundo Perdido, developing during the 7th and 8th centuries AD; This marked an important change {{in the use of the}} Mundo Perdido, which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities.
