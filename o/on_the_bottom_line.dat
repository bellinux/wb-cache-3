The initial position has the value represented in the symbol. On the following line, {{the value of the}} symbol is multiplied by 20; on the third line from the bottom it's multiplied by 400, and each successive line is growing by powers of 20. This positional system allows the calculation of large figures, necessary for chronology and astronomy.|$|E

2500|$|The voice flute was {{a popular}} size of {{recorder}} in the eighteenth century, especially in England. It offered an alternative instrument for amateurs to play music written for the transverse flute, since both instruments are at the same pitch. The usual clef used for recorder parts was the French violin clef, with G <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> of the staff. Imagining this clef {{in place of the}} treble clef and using the normal F-alto fingerings on a voice flute renders music composed for flute or violin in the original key [...] Although the rather large number of surviving eighteenth-century voice flutes suggests this may have been a common practice at that time, there is little documentary evidence to support the idea ( [...] ; [...] ). Parts intended for this instrument were also often written in transposed notation, so the player could imagine he was playing an ordinary alto in F ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Printed {{music is}} often written on several {{different}} staves. [...] For instance, piano music is typically written {{on two different}} staves combined into the grand staff: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). [...] The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music {{and the fact that}} the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. Bar over bar format is most similar to print music. [...] Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are line over line format, , paragraph style, and bar by bar format. [...] As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part. [...] No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used. [...] However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.|$|E
