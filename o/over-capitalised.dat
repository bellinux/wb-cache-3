This was aprtly dfone by money borrowed at what is now the high rate of [...] per cent., and the Company has now been so engaged in meeting their fixed charges, amounting to about £13,000, out of a gross annual income of £30,000, as to leave nothing for dividend on Preference and Ordinary capital.|$|E

SVR shareholders would receive a permanent 6% dividend. Incidentally the Midland Railway was not interested in this kind of arrangement with the Neath and Brecon Railway, (which had taken over the SVJ&N&BR), as the N&BR was considerably <b>over-capitalised,</b> following a series of financial improprieties and the failure of a contractor who was also financing much of the construction personally.|$|E

Result: difficulty of earning dividend, over-work, over- worry, constant fear of being wound up. Now, there is that about your work that suggests to me you would be happier earning five hundred a year than you ever will be earning two thousand. To pay your dividend--to earn your two thousand--you have to do work that brings you no pleasure in the doing. Content with five hundred, you could afford to do only that work that does give you pleasure. This is not a perfect world, we must remember. In the perfect world the thinker would be worth more than the mere jester. In the perfect world the farmer would be worth more than the stockbroker. In making the exchange I had to write myself down. I earn less money, but get more enjoyment out of life. I {{used to be able}} to afford champagne, but my liver was always wrong, and I dared not drink it. Now I cannot afford champagne, but I enjoy my beer. That is my theory, that we are all of us entitled to payment according to our market value, neither more nor less. You can take it all in cash. I used to. Or you can take less cash and more fun: that is what I am getting now." ...|$|R

They require {{a mixture of}} lean and agile {{principles}} and, in the sugar industry, infrastructures are generally <b>over-capitalised.</b> In this short communication, four aspects that pertain to an improvement in material handling are discussed briefly: (i) capacity utilisation can be improved when volumes and qualities become more consistent, (ii) insufficient risk management may exist, (iii) stockpiles need to be managed and reflect {{the health of the}} system and (iv) cane deterioration needs to be carefully measured and managed. Finally, it is proposed that the sugarcane supply chain will function better where more than one mode of operation exists...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of the British railway network, 1825 – 1914, investigates claims that the network was <b>over-capitalised</b> due to excessive duplication of lines. A counterfactual network is constructed to represent the most efficient alternative network that could have been constructed given what was known at the time. Comparison of the actual and counterfactual networks suggests that the actual network was even more inefficient than is commonly alleged. The roots of this inefficiency can be traced to excessive competition between towns which national government was too weak to control. Although Parliament {{was in a position to}} regulate excessive competition between the private railway companies that built the system, competition between towns discouraged Parliament for regulating inter-company competition to an adequate degree...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some of the}} social, {{economic and}} political consequences of financial inflation for the activities of companies and the operations in debt markets of an increasingly financial middle class. In this paper ‘financialisation ’ is broadly defined as the inflation of capital markets. The first section of the paper explains the Kalecki-Steindl theory of enforced company indebtedness in a middle-class society. The second section of the paper shows how financial inflation makes companies <b>over-capitalised,</b> resulting in {{a decline in the}} trend of long-term investment. The third section shows how forced company indebtedness is modified when the middle classes start to operate in inflating asset markets. A conclusion sketches out some of the consequences of this financialisation for politics, social policy, and moral and cultural attitudes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} ‘financialisation ’ is broadly {{defined as a}} process of {{inflating}} capital markets or more strictly financial inflation. The paper examines some of the social, economic and political consequences of financial inflation for the activities of companies and the operations in debt markets of an increasingly financial middle class. Financial inflation alters the behaviour of individuals and firms, and hence the character and dynamics of the capitalist economy and society. The first section of the paper explains the Kalecki–Steindl theory of enforced company indebtedness in a middle-class society. The second section shows how financial inflation makes companies <b>over-capitalised,</b> resulting in a decline in the trend of long-term investment. The third section shows how forced company indebtedness is modified as the middle classes extend their consumption financed through inflating asset markets. A conclusion sketches out some of the consequences of this financialisation for politics, social policy, and moral and cultural attitudes...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{access to}} land in the Pacific remains a {{difficult}} problem. This paper presents results from a field survey conducted in 12 randomly selected settlements in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, to investigate how settlers acquire land for housing. The analysis shows that several means for land acquisition is used; ranging from outright occupation (that is, land invasion) to purchase of use-rights from the customary landowners. The security of tenure on land held under customary title is maintained using mechanisms ranging from group occupation by members of a clan/tribe {{to the use of}} the traditional systems of reciprocation and token-exchange. Security of tenure on land held by the state, in contrast, is maintained thorough political patronage. Settlers fear eviction more from the state than the customary owners suggesting that ownership rights are relatively more secure on land held under customary title. The length of occupation is viewed by the settlers as cementing their ownership-rights to the occupied land. Similarly, some of the settlers have <b>over-capitalised</b> into permanent housing with the understanding that the State would have to compensate them for the improvements should they be evicted...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand's quota {{management}} system (QMS) was implemented in 1986 to address {{problems caused by}} a regulated open entry management system {{in place for the}} previous two decades. Excess capacity in the inshore fisheries caused several stocks to become depleted and conflicts to intensify between fishing sectors. The allocation of individual transferable quota (ITQ) was viewed as the best way to improve efficiency within the <b>over-capitalised</b> inshore fisheries and provide incentives for developing the deepwater fisheries. The expected benefits of the QMS fit with the political climate at that time, as the government was using market forces to address the deteriorating economy. This article outlines the results of a research project that involved four medium to large-sized, highly vertically integrated New Zealand seafood firms. The purpose of the project was to identify these firms' sources of competitiveness in export markets and the process the firms used to develop sources of competitiveness, while adapting to rapid and radical changes to the political and business environment and transformation of the fisheries management system. The project's results show that the basis to seafood firm competitiveness is the security of supply to the fisheries resource provided by the QMS and aquaculture legislation. The project also outlines the role that government policies have in sustaining firm- and industry-level competitiveness. This article contributes to the broader discussion on the application of ITQ and other types of long-term access rights to the management of fisheries and does not express the views of the Ministry of Fisheries.
