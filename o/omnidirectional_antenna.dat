2500|$|Communications: Curiosity is {{equipped}} with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. [...] The X-band system has one radio, with a 15W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9W transmit power), sharing one <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna.</b> This can communicate with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2Mbit/s and 256kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only {{able to communicate with}} Curiosity for about 8 minutes per day. [...] The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by Curiosity (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the communication infrastructure as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.|$|E

5000|$|Higher-gain <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antennas</b> {{can also}} be built.

High-gain <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antennas</b> are generally realized using collinear dipole arrays. These consist of multiple half-wave dipoles mounted collinearly (in a line), fed in phase. The coaxial collinear (COCO) antenna uses transposed coaxial sections to produce in-phase half-wavelength radiators.

40|$|Abstract — Nodes, using CSMA/CA type medium {{access control}} (MAC) {{protocols}} (e. g. IEEE 802. 11 e) and <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antennas,</b> in an ad-hoc network {{may not be able}} to transmit packets to each other concurrently due to spatial contention for the shared wireless medium. The maximum network performance depends on the maximum number of possible concurrent transmissions. This can be maximized in a multi-hop ad-hoc network using directional antennas. Neighboring nodes falling outside the transmission region are less vulnerable to co-channel interference. Directional antennas allow increased transmission range by reducing noise, interference and multi-path fading. We emphasize the interference reduction capability of directional antennas in the context of suburban ad-hoc networks (SAHN). We build an analytical model, based on the basic channel access mechanism of IEEE 802. 11, to show the effect of interference on network performance along multiple hops using three antenna schemes; multiple fixed directional <b>antennas,</b> <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antennas</b> with multiple frequency channels and <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antennas</b> with single frequency channel. We extend our analyses for IEEE 802. 11 e to accommodate different traffic classes. We also verify our analyses with extensive simulations...|$|R
