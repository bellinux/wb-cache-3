5000|$|In 1907, the Associated Oil Company (later Tidewater Oil) bought Falls of Clyde and {{converted}} {{her to a}} bulk oil tanker with a capacity of [...] Ten large steel tanks were built into her hull, and a pump room, boiler and generator fitted forward of an <b>oil-tight</b> bulkhead. In this configuration she brought kerosene to Hawaii and returned to California with molasses for cattle feed.|$|E
5000|$|The Rocket 3/Trident was {{introduced}} in summer of 1968 to critical acclaim, but was eclipsed four weeks later by the Honda CB750. Compared to the British triple, the CB750 had a five-speed gearbox, overhead camshaft, <b>oil-tight</b> engine, electric start and a disc brake. The Honda outsold the Triumph in the US market; in 1970, to revive sales Triumph restyled export versions with the [...] "classic" [...] look.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 the {{domination}} of the inline-twin engine for high-performance street bikes {{came to an end}} when Triumph Engineering developed an inline-triple engine for the BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident. The 1969 Kawasaki H1 Mach III with an inline-triple two-stroke, and the Honda CB750's Inline-four engine into the bargain, foreshadowed the ascendancy of multi-cylinder engines. The W series engines were <b>oil-tight</b> and reliable, but by comparison they had low levels of performance with high levels of vibration, and were ultimately unsuccessful on the sales floor. At the same time that production of the W series was ending in Japan, Kawasaki came up with a formula for successful four-stroke street bikes in its Z series.|$|E
40|$|A plastic {{analysis}} method {{is commonly used}} in ship and offshore structural system to utilize the ultimate strength. In this paper, the basic principle of plastic {{analysis method}} is applied to ship grillages such as transverse <b>oil-tight</b> bulkheads. The main {{emphasis is placed on}} the optimum arrangement of grillage system to give minimum weight. Additional parametric study is carried out to find the effect of various arrangement of grillage system. The above methods are applied to <b>oil-tight</b> bulkhead design, and results are compared with the existing one...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 58 All {{flexible}} shaft couplings must {{be surrounded by}} a guard, in order to comply with OHSA requirements. For turbomachinery applications, this guard is an <b>oil-tight</b> enclosure and {{the purpose is to}} trap any oil escaping the machinery seals. When couplings rotate at high speeds in <b>oil-tight</b> enclosures, they shear the air, and this shearing results in a significant heat generation. The temperature of the enclosure, as well as the coupling, depends on the amount of air shearing and on the ability of the enclosure to dissipate the heat. Another problem with couplings operating in <b>oil-tight</b> enclosures is that negative pressures are created occasionally in the vicinity of machinery seals, causing oil to be sucked in the enclosure, which is particularly detrimental for gear reducers. Numerous tests were conducted at Koppers' Power Transmission facilities with various types and sizes of couplings, operating at various speeds, within enclosures of many configurations. Measurements were taken of the coupling and the enclosure temperatures, pressures in the enclosures, and the cooling effect of air flow and oil spray. Formulas useful in calculating enclosure temperatures are presented. Design guides for fabricating enclosures which operate at acceptable temperatures are also produced. Enclosures fabricated using these guidelines are successfully operating in petrochemical plants...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 37 - 42 Coupling {{enclosures}} are <b>oil-tight</b> guards {{which serve}} the double purpose of protecting {{people from the}} rotating coupling and returning oil that escapes past the seals back to the oil reservoir. Enclosures were, and still are, a much-neglected component of machinery trains. When used with gear couplings they are notorious for oil leaks; when used with dry couplings they can operate so hot that they may harm people, and even cause machinery failures. Four such bad cases are discussed, the solutions used to correct the problems are reviewed, and design recommendations are provided...|$|E
