40|$|Abstract: The {{proliferation}} of mobile technology presents {{an opportunity for}} (language) teachers to experiment with using mobile devices to enhance the learning process. However, research in Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) is relatively new and unexplored in South Africa, resulting in a lack of empirical evidence to guide such curriculum integration and implementation. This study was undertaken to investigate students’ experiences using their mobile phones to develop Afrikaans vocabulary. As an <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activity,</b> they received mini vocabulary lessons on their mobile phones. The retention of target words was then assessed and reinforced during text-based activities. The findings confirm that using a mobile phone as a learning tool allows learning to take place anywhere, anytime {{and serves as a}} bridge between formal and informal learning. When used for vocabulary development, the choice of app, the type of activity, the content and size of the message impact on the learning experience...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} entering higher education has grown considerably during the last decade. High student numbers and the attendant large class sizes present significant challenges for teachers. Such challenges include knowing how to ensure students are engaging in appropriate <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activity,</b> how to provide prompt and personalised feedback and how to establish what students know and what they don't. If these challenges are left un-resolved the students' learning will not be well supported. This could ultimately lead to students failing modules. This research presents {{a response to the}} growth of the student population and was prompted by a high failure rate in a core first year engineering module. The large numbers of students enrolled on the module presented exactly the kinds of challenges noted above, and the existing assessment regime did little to motivate student learning. The response presented in this thesis is the design, development, testing, implementation and evaluation of a new assessment programme; an approach to assessment that provides students with unique weekly tasks. The tasks were formally assessed and contributed towards the students' marks for the module. To ensure the viability of the assessment programme, bespoke computer tools were developed to create, collect and mark the tasks, and to provide feedback to the students. The implementation has been evaluated through an exploration {{of the impact of the}} assessment programme on student support, teaching and student learning. In three of the four years where the students were exposed to the assessment programme, the failure rate on the module decreased. The reduction in failure rate is arguably associated with the alignment of the assessment programme with good pedagogy. During the implementation of the assessment programme, the students were engaging in appropriate <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activity</b> in relation to the current topic area. The students had an opportunity to engage in dialogue with their peers and were receiving prompt and regular feedback. The teachers also benefited, since they were able to prepare lectures according to the students' level of demonstrable understanding. In the case where the failure rate did not improve, the students themselves suggested they were downloading and using worked solutions to the problems from the internet. It is suggested that such activity neither provides meaningful opportunity to practise, nor alerts the students to their genuine levels of understanding of the topic areas. In this case the students were following solution procedures rather than developing their own. Student feedback on the assessment has been positive, with many noting how being led to engage with their studies was useful. Somewhat concerning was the feedback from students who noted "they thought the work would help them with their examinations", "they wanted the assessment programme used on other modules" and yet many indicated "they would not have engaged with the activity if it did not count towards the module grade"...|$|E

40|$|International {{education}} is the fourth largest export industry in the Australian economy contributing over $ 19 billion per year. In 2009, the much-publicised spate of attacks on international students in Sydney and Melbourne led to a rapid decline in student numbers, particularly Indian students. The main aim {{of this research was}} to provide practical strategies for Australian universities to reduce the rate of international student attrition in order to maximise their contribution to the economy. To achieve this aim, three objectives were identified. Firstly, to explain the differences in international students’ level of involvement in <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activities</b> by using Hofstede’s original cultural dimensions model. Secondly, to identify background information and characteristics that contribute to, or impact upon, international students’ level of involvement. Finally, to identify the impact different residential living environments have on the level of involvement of international students. These objectives led to the three research questions that guided this project. They were: (1)  How do cultural dimensions influence international student involvement?; (2) Can we predict international student involvement in <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activities</b> using background information?; and (3) Are international students living in student residential communities more involved than international students living off-campus? An online survey questionnaire collected primarily quantitative data from 251  participants across Australia and used three main concepts to identify and predict international students’ experiences while at Australian universities. Using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-Squared test and stepwise regression analysis, this research identified 16 major findings plus another  112 statistically significant relationships. These findings either supported previous findings or represented new contributions to the international education and business literature and social science more broadly. The practical recommendations this research project provides will be of interest to both institutional-level and government-level policy makers, academics, university support staff and tutors, and international students...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flipped {{classroom}} {{is a new}} pedagogical method, which employs asynchronous video lectures and practice problems as homework, and active, group-based problem solving activities in the classroom. It represents a unique combination of learning theories {{once thought to be}} incompatible. Active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a constructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles. Among others, these include the type of in-class and <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activities,</b> the measures used to evaluate the study, and methodological characteristics for each study. Student perceptions of the flipped classroom are somewhat complex, but are mainly positive overall. Students tend to prefer in-person lectures to video lectures, but prefer interactive classroom activities over lectures. This paper provides course teaching design in universities of China based on the thought of the flipped classroom. Studies are characterized on several dimensions. It suggests that student learning is improved for the flipped compared to traditional classroom.

40|$|Given {{the widely}} {{accepted}} notion of whole person education in Confucian societies such as Hong Kong, Mainland China and Singapore, {{it is surprising}} that research literature originated in these societies pays little attention to how students learn and develop through out-of-class experiences at university. There is little research evidence on how the prevailing culture among student social communities (residential halls and student societies/clubs) influences students' social involvement and development. This paper examines 42 Chinese students' social experiences and development during their freshman year at a Hong Kong university. The majority of them were intensively involved in <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activities.</b> Their active social involvement was both a response to the culture of student communities and a conscious choice about social experiences at university. As a result, the students attained development in four dimensions: (1) the social competences of interpersonal and collaboration skills and new friendships; (2) the practical competences of time management, organisation, negotiation, decision making and leadership; (3) the intellectual competences of open-mindedness and independent judgment; and (4) the personal competences of self- responsibility and self-confidence.

The emphasis which is often placed on the academic-related goals of an international student can often overlook the broader aims and benefits which can accompany their stay in the new host environment. This paper attempts to bridge the theoretical gap between the work of Toyokawa and Toyokawa (2000), which focusses on international students without measuring more specific gains in areas such as language and cultural observation, and Kuh (1995), which focusses successfully on personal development benefits but which deals almost exclusively with home-based (largely white Caucasian) students. Through the use of reflective questionnaires and interviews, data will be gathered on the volunteering placements of a number of international students. Specific questions will be asked in the areas of language (for example, the acquisition of new vocabulary and slang), cultural awareness (for example, observations about the British workplace and labour market) and personal development (especially in relation to transferable skills). In this way, it is hoped that more fruitful conclusions can be reached regarding international learners' experiences in <b>out-of-class</b> <b>activities</b> - in this case volunteering - {{and the extent to which}} this type of placement can realise benefits to the learners in terms of language, culture and employability...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{relationship}} between pre-college activity participation and college leadership through motivation to lead and leadership self-efficacy, paying particular attention to gender differences. Undergraduate students from a liberal arts college were recruited two separate times via email before freshman year and during the spring semester of their senior year. The findings of this study reveal that relations between pre-college activity participation and college leadership are not mediated by motivation to lead or leadership self-efficacy. Furthermore, the study found no significant gender differences related to motivation to lead or leadership self-efficacy. However, the findings of this study support previous claims that gender plays a strong role in activity participation (Buser, 1980; Kezar 2 ̆ 6 Moriarty, 2000; Medley, 1982; Morris 2 ̆ 6 Starrfield, 1982). In this study, females participated in high school activities significantly more than males, but males participated in college activities significantly more than females.

40|$|Ensuring that {{students}} spend time preparing for class {{has always been}} one of the challenges of teaching. Indeed, when students are given an assignment that they are required to do before coming to the next lecture—whether it be written exercises or just studying—one wonders how often they are actually doing it. There are many ways in which teachers can evaluate whether or not students are prepared for class (i. e., have done “their reading”). Some of these methods to promote more out-of-class studying have included collecting written homework, giving quizzes, and even extra credit. This paper discusses the role of technology in the classroom as an alternative means to ensure student preparation for class lectures. In particular, this paper reports on a particular hybrid Spanish language program which was implemented at a large university in the United States.
