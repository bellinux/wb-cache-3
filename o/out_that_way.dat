500|$|Barbery {{incorporates}} several themes {{into the}} novel. References to philosophy, for instance, abound throughout, getting increasingly dense {{as the story}} progresses. Barbery confesses to having [...] "followed a long, boring course of studies in philosophy", and comments that [...] "I expected it to help me understand better that which surrounds me: but it didn't work <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Literature has taught me more. I was interested in exploring the bearing philosophy could really have on one's life, and how. I wanted to illuminate this process. That's where the desire to anchor philosophy to a story, a work of fiction, was born: to give it more meaning, make it more physically real, and render it, perhaps, even entertaining." ...|$|E

Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did."

500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated [...] "The thing about writer's block is {{that you want to}} write so f---king bad, [...] the songs don't come <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> They come from life. So you've got to live to write." [...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven Must Be Like This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998).

500|$|In January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case {{became known}} as the [...] "Scream murder" [...] and fell under intense media {{scrutiny}} after the boys claimed they were inspired by Scream and Scream 2. The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were a whole bunch of reasons why they acted <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely." [...] The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers. [...] However, presiding judge John Cheroske ordered that evidence pertaining to Scream be barred and that the case not be referred to as the [...] "Scream murder", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.|$|E

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane.

500|$|Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{rated the}} matches {{out of five}} stars in his review of the event. He gave the main event 2 3/4 stars and {{discussed}} {{the amount of time}} it was given, stating it was [...] "just enough time for a suitable main event" [...] but that it did not [...] "leave much flex time for things to run past the bare minimum for a PPV main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they're going to do with Sting and Nash." [...] Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout, commenting that TNA management needed to start fining [...] "wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull" [...] because it was [...] "just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling." [...] He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a [...] "superb match" [...] with a [...] "scaring finish" [...] since the [...] "potential for something going wrong given Angle's legit neck problems was substantial" [...] even if [...] "everything was planned" [...] to work <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1/2 stars and stated it [...] "was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive" [...] and that it felt [...] "like yet another weapons match." [...] "The match was okay, but nothing more. The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match", said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match, which he gave 1 1/4 stars. Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars, but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest. He did comment on the X Division Championship match, saying it was a [...] "very good match" [...] and gave it 3 stars.|$|E

2500|$|OSHA was {{established}} in 1971 under the Department of Labor.

2500|$|Roy Heffernan {{returned}} to his native Australia, {{and became one of}} the main wrestlers for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) (the Australian version) under promoter Jim Barnett. Heffernan retained his [...] "Ultra Australian" [...] gimmick complete with Bush hat and boomerang, but what had made him a heel (bad guy) in the United States made him a beloved face (good guy) in Australia. Heffernan's Fan Club Yearbook circa 1966 gives the following physical statistics for Roy Heffernan: neck 17.5inches; chest 48.5inches; waist 32.5inches; thigh 27inches; biceps 17.5inches; calf 17.5inches. He was billed in 1967 as weighing 225lb. Costello was originally supposed to join Heffernan in Australia but it never worked <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> leaving Costello in the United States while Heffernan wrestled as a singles wrestler. Later in his career, Heffernan became involved in the actual running of WCW before retiring in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The 1980s {{were a very}} {{turbulent}} time in Sweden that {{initiated the}} occasional decline of Social Democratic Party rule. In the 1980s, pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized, and mechanical engineering was digitalized. In 1986, one of the Social Democratic Party's strongest champions of egalitarianism and democracy, Olof Palme was assassinated. Swedish capital was increasingly moving Swedish investment into other European countries as the European Union coalesced, and a hegemonic consensus was forming among the elite financial community: progressive taxation and pro-egalitarian redistribution became economic heresy. A leading proponent of capital's cause at the time, Social Democrat Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt reminisced in an interview, [...] "The negative inheritance I received from my predecessor Gunnar Sträng (Minister of Finance, 1955–1976) was a strongly progressive tax system with high marginal taxes. This was supposed {{to bring about a}} just and equal society. But I eventually came to the opinion that it simply didn't work <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Progressive taxes created instead a society of wranglers, cheaters, peculiar manipulations, false ambitions and new injustices. It took me at least a decade to get a part of the party to see this." [...] With the capitalist confederation's defection from the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement and Swedish capital investing in other European countries rather than Sweden, as well as the global rise of neoliberal political-economic hegemony, the Social Democratic Party backed away from the progressive Meidner reform.|$|E
