40|$|TEMPO-mediated {{oxidation}} {{has been}} reported to effectively convert C 6 primary hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups for better water-solubility. However, the pH decreases continuously during the oxidation process, and it is therefore difficult to maintain the stability of the reaction. The control of pH at a constant level throughout the oxidation process is a complicated task. The applicability of a carbonate buffer system and a borax buffer system with various continuous addition rate of sodium hypochlorite solution was considered. Carbonate buffer solution and borax buffer solution can efficiently buffer the pH. The results of carboxyl content and DP <b>of</b> <b>celluloses</b> proved that the activities of sodium hypochlorite solution can be maintained when sodium hypochlorite is added with controlled flow rates without adjusting pH by hydrochloric acid. Buffer solutions created a milder reaction environment in which the damage <b>of</b> <b>celluloses</b> would be buffered. The conclusion was consistent with DP tests <b>of</b> <b>celluloses.</b> Compared with carbonate buffer, the borax buffer with high ability of penetration could enhance the depth and width of oxidation, which was demonstrated by the results of X-ray diffraction patterns and carboxyl content <b>of</b> <b>celluloses...</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{compare the}} {{decomposition}} products from WS portions on various types <b>of</b> crystalline <b>celluloses</b> by semi-flow HCW treatment, cellulose with similar DP {{are necessary for}} their evaluation.

30|$|Nanocellulose is {{prepared}} by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. Mechanical methods employ various forces {{to reduce the}} size <b>of</b> the natural <b>cellulose</b> fibers to nanoscale. This approach includes multiple passages <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> fibers through a high-pressure homogenizer and leads to the significant energy consumption (above 25  kW/kg) [6]. Spence et al. [21] have shown that the homogenization process is the most expensive method for the nanomaterial isolation. Chemical methods are based on the cleavage of 1 – 4 glycosidic bonds <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> chains and an isolation <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> nanocrystals eliminating the amorphous cellulose part [22]. Enzymatic methods generate nanocellulose through the biosynthesis from monosaccharides or fermentation <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> fibers. The enzymatic methods are time-consuming and require expensive reagents. In some instances, the initial enzymatic treatment <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> prior to the mechanical grinding can decrease the energy consumption required for the preparation of nanocellulose [23]. For these reasons, a pre-treatment of the fibrous material is usually performed in order to decrease the size <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> fibers and to ease the fibrillation and the process of nanocellulose preparation.|$|R
5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> acetate in 1903, which {{was much less}} {{flammable}} than cellulose nitrate.

5|$|Maniac Mansions {{story and}} {{structure}} were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation {{was a simple}} paper-and-pencil board game, in which the mansion's floor plan {{was used as a}} game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> acetate were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by David Fox, was not created until after programming had begun.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made <b>of</b> <b>cellulose,</b> and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{improved}} approach for production and characterization <b>of</b> regenerated <b>celluloses</b> from mahang wood is proposed. The {{purpose of this}} research is to extract cellulose from mahang (Macaranga gigantea) wood and convert the extracted cellulose (MCC) to nanocellulose using ionic liquid pretreatment. 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) was used to treat cellulose that has been extracted from mahang wood. Three different regenerated celluloses were obtained from the different weight ratio <b>of</b> <b>celluloses</b> treated with BMIMCl (2 wt %, 5 wt % and 8 wt %). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the structural, morphological and thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>celluloses</b> and also the regenerated celluloses samples. The results of characterizations indicated that 2 wt % <b>of</b> regenerated <b>celluloses</b> with the highest amount of ionic liquid used obtained high crystallinity compared to 5 wt % and 8 wt % regenerated celluloses.

5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> in food and are thus the most likely caste {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E

5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown <b>of</b> <b>cellulose.</b> Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

These kinetic parameters were compared with the relative crystallinity indices and estimated accessible surface areas <b>of</b> the <b>celluloses.</b> For type I celluloses having similar crystallinities and simple nonaggregating particle morphologies, the fermentation rate constants displayed a strong positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 978) with gross specific surface area; lag time exhibited a weaker, negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 930) with gross specific surface area. Crystallinity was shown to have a relatively minor effect on the digestion rate and lag time. Swelling <b>of</b> microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> with 72 to 77 % phosphoric acid yielded substrates which were fermented slightly more rapidly than the original material. However, treatment with higher concentrations of phosphoric acid resulted in a more slowly fermented substrate, despite a decrease in crystallinity {{and an increase in}} pore volume. This reduced fermentation rate was apparently due to the partial conversion <b>of</b> the <b>cellulose</b> from the type I to the type II allomorph, since mercerized (type II) cellulose was also fermented more slowly, and only after a much longer lag period.
