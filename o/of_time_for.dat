5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the entire game or {{they may have to}} make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda is also {{associated}} with the Mesopotamian creation story of Tiamat, the goddess of Chaos. She bore many demons for her husband, Apsu, but eventually decided to destroy them in a war that ended when Marduk killed her. He used her body to create the constellations as markers <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> humans.|$|E
5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|First {{shown as}} a {{technical}} and thematic demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division. Both were the first free-roaming 3D game in their respective series. Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release Ocarina <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>for</b> the 64DD, a disk drive peripheral for the system which was also still in development.|$|E

At the last moment, New Delhi was outfavoured by Hyderabad, which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|The World Ends with You is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game, arranged into three chapters {{based on the}} three weeks that Neku {{is involved in the}} Reaper's Game, with each chapter further divided by each day of the week. The player controls Neku and his partner as they explore Shibuya to complete each day's mission. Although most missions require completion within a certain time for Neku and his partner, this timer is not correlated to the passage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the player.|$|E

5|$|The {{decisions}} {{had been}} made {{at the highest levels}} and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive. On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation Dewey Canyon II was under way.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (<b>for</b> example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|Hirokazu Yashuhara of Sonic Team went to England and {{fine-tuned}} {{the game}} {{due to lack}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> communication. Technical and scheduling issues caused Sato to change the game design, leading to a dispute with producer Yuji Naka, and Sato removed his name from the credits. The game's final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics details to get the game to run optimally on different computers. Options include allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration, or adjusting the game's draw distance, affecting how soon objects in the distance are visible. Like many other previous Sonic games during this time period, a largely unrelated Sonic R game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game {{around the same time}} in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5|$|Needing {{to score}} quickly, Virginia Tech's {{subsequent}} drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked {{the first play}} of the drive, but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes of the drive for 46yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown that cut California's lead to 49–42. The drive took just two minutes off the clock, leaving 4:26remaining in the game. California received the post-touchdown kickoff and went three and out, leaving plenty <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a potential game-tying Virginia Tech drive.|$|E
