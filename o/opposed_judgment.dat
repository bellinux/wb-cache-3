Since Chief Justice Laskin was a strong centralist, they usually took opposing views on federalism issues.

The cultural and political thrust of this programme can be best understood by a comparison with Talcott Parsons’ theory of societal community. Like Nisbet, Parsons sought to critically reformulate the sociological concept of community. Unlike Nisbet, he did this as a liberal defense of modernity. Notwithstanding their diametrically <b>opposed</b> <b>judgments</b> on the project and prospect of modernity as it stood in post-War America, at a more generalized level the two theorists converge in what can be called “voluntaristic functionalism. ” Such a convergence assumes that the interpenetration of “society” and “community” (in Toennies’s original dichotomous sense) is possible and is ultimately inseparable from the social meaning of action. From this perspective, Nisbet’s and Parsons’ understandings of community, in particular the condition of possibility of its becoming “societal” and thereby modern, is summarily contrasted with “state-centered” and “society-centered” approaches...|$|R

Concerning the fact students are exposed to media influence, and since the time of schooling is a time of learning and acquiring important skills as well, it is important to form a critical attitude towards media content which is being offered to us. Acquiring media literacy can be truly successful only if we consider that relationship between specificity of media and the way those specificities are understood by those getting education. Thus conceived media literacy can contribute to acquiring many social values. In theoretical interpretation we pointed out the tendencies and perspectives of media literacy development. We have come to a conclusion that adequately conceived media literacy can contribute to adopting many social values. Whereby, we can recognize a theme for further research...|$|R

40|$|In {{her recent}} work Cora Diamond discusses, with {{reference}} to Elizabeth Anscombe, David Wiggins and Bernard Williams, the logical function of propositions which, albeit they state something true, lack an intelligible negation, and are asymmetrical in this sense. An example from David Wiggins is ‘Slavery is unjust and unsupportable’ the negation of which, he argues, cannot be part of any ‘workable system of moral ideas’. Diamond develops an account of such propositions as ‘thinking guides’ whose purpose is to enable one to think well and, following Aristotle and Anscombe, she proposes {{an account of the}} truth and correspondence with reality of such propositions. While I agree with Diamond’s account in many respects, I argue in what follows that her way of connecting truth with usefulness and importance cannot give us a workable account of truth, and that unless we distinguish clearly between the senses in which thinking guides as <b>opposed</b> to <b>judgments</b> are true, her account risks misleadingly assimilating cases that ought to be kept separate. Instead, I propose to clarify the matter with the help of Wittgenstein’s distinction between temporal and non-temporal statements. Furthermore, I use this distinction to address a relevant problem with Wiggins’ account of truth and objectivity in ethics, as well as to argue that Williams’ argument against Wiggins on objectivity fails. Equipped with Wittgenstein’s distinction we can steer clear of ethical relativism...|$|R

Although much research has addressed human observers' ability to discriminate true and deceptive statements, less {{is known about}} the psychological processes involved in such judgments.

The results of an experiment show, as predicted, that the perceived ease with which participants could identify clues strongly influenced credibility judgments. Ironically, mustering more clues in support of a truthful account lowered credibility judgments; in contrast, mustering more clues in support of a deceptive account increased credibility judgments. Mediation analyses suggest that this is because participants relied on a feeling-based as <b>opposed</b> to content-based <b>judgment</b> strategy.

40|$|This article {{shows that}} {{judicial}} review has a democratic justification, {{although it is}} not necessary for democratic government and its virtues are controversial and often speculative. Against critics like Waldron and Bellamy, it shows that judges, no less than legislators, can embody democratic forms of representation, accountability and participation. Hence, judicial review is not undemocratic simply because it enables unelected judges to over-rule elected legislators when people disagree about rights. Against recent defenders of judicial review, such as Eisgruber and Brettschneider, it shows that democratic arguments for judicial review do not require judges to be better at protecting rights than legislators. Hence a democratic justification for judicial review does not depend on complex and inevitably controversial interpretations and evaluations of judicial as <b>opposed</b> to legislative <b>judgments.</b> Democratic government does not demand special virtue, competence or wisdom in its citizens or their leaders. From a democratic perspective, therefore, the case for judicial review is that it enables individuals to vindicate their rights against government in ways that parallel those they commonly use against each other. This makes judicial review normatively attractive whether or not it leads to better decisions than would be made by other means...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays on economic development and experimental economics. In Chapter 1, I present experimental evidence about how Thais treat information from domestic and foreign sources. Thai students answer a series of objective general-knowledge questions, both before and after observing answers given by American students and other Thai students. By looking at how subjects update their original answers after observing information, it is possible to estimate the weights that subjects assign to themselves, the American answers they see, and the Thai answers they see. Consistent with previous studies, I find that Thais exhibit a significant level of overconfidence in that they overweigh their initial answers. Despite their overconfidence, the relative weight that they give to answers given by Americans compared to answers given by other Thais is, in most instances, statistically indistinguishable from the optimal solution. Moreover, the experimental design allows me to distinguish between two possible explanations for this fact. Under one hypothesis, subjects overestimate the relative precision of American answers, but fail to recognize the value of independence, and the two errors cancel each other out. Under a second hypothesis, subjects recognize the relative accuracy of each group and appreciate the value of independence. (cont.) The data rejects the first hypothesis and supports the second. In Chapter 2, I report the results of an experiment that tests for the presence of an information endowment effect. Experimental evidence suggests that an individual who is endowed with a coffee mug or chocolate bar demands a much higher price to sell than an unendowed person is willing to pay to acquire the same good. This study shows that a similar phenomenon does not exist when the endowment consists of information rather than goods. The results suggest that the endowment effect operates primarily on preferences as <b>opposed</b> to <b>judgment.</b> In Chapter 3, my co-author and I use econometric methods to create a data set that makes it possible to better identify what areas of Thailand are poor and unequal.

40|$|How do {{external}} stimuli and our internal state coalesce {{to create}} the distinctive aesthetic pleasures that give vibrance to human experience? Neuroaesthetics has so far focused on the neural correlates of observing beautiful stimuli compared to neutral or ugly stimuli, or on neural correlates of judging for beauty as <b>opposed</b> to other <b>judgments.</b> Our group questioned whether this approach is sufficient. In our view, a brain region that assesses beauty should show beauty-level-dependent activation during the beauty judgment task, but not during other, unrelated tasks. We therefore performed an fMRI experiment in which subjects judged visual textures for beauty, naturalness and roughness. Our focus was on finding brain activation related to the rated beauty level of the stimuli, which would take place exclusively during the beauty judgment. An initial whole-brain analysis did not reveal such interactions, yet {{a number of the}} regions showing main effects of the judgment task or the beauty level of stimuli were selectively sensitive to beauty level during the beauty task. Of the regions that were more active during beauty judgments than roughness judgments, the frontomedian cortex and the amygdala demonstrated the hypothesized interaction effect, while the posterior cingulate cortex did not. The latter region, which only showed a task effect, may play a supporting role in beauty assessments, such as attending to one’s internal state rather than the external world. Most of the regions showing interaction effects of judgment and beauty level correspond to regions that have previously been implicated in aesthetics using different stimulus classes, but based on either task or beauty effect...|$|R
6000|$|Much {{industry}} and art have been used, among the illiterate and unexperienced, to throw imputations on this prosecution, and its conduct, because so great {{a proportion of}} the evidence offered on this trial (especially on the latter charges) has been circumstantial. Against the prejudices of the ignorant your Committee <b>opposes</b> the <b>judgment</b> of the learned. It is known to them, that, when this proof is in its greatest perfection, that is, when it is most abundant in circumstances, it is much superior to positive proof; and for this we have {{the authority of the}} learned judge who presided at the trial of Captain Donellan. [...] "On the part of the prosecution, a great deal of evidence has been laid before you. It is all circumstantial evidence, and in its nature it must be so: for, in cases of this sort, no man is weak enough to commit the act in the presence of other persons, or to suffer them to see what he does at the time; and therefore it can only be made out by circumstances, either before the committing of the act, at the time when it was committed, or subsequent to it. And a presumption, which necessarily arises from circumstances, is very often more convincing and more satisfactory than any other kind of evidence: because it is not within the reach and compass of human abilities to invent a train of circumstances which shall be so connected together as to amount to a proof of guilt, without affording opportunities of contradicting a great part, if not all, of these circumstances. But if the circumstances are such as, when laid together, bring conviction to your minds, it is then fully equal, if not, as I told you before, more convincing than positive evidence." [...] In the trial of Donellan no such selection was used as we have lately experienced; no limitation to the production of every matter, before, at, and after the fact charged. The trial was (as we conceive) rightly conducted by the learned judge; because secret crimes, such as secret assassination, poisoning, bribery, peculation, and extortion, (the three last of which this House has charged upon Mr. Hastings,) can very rarely be proved in any other way. That way of proof is made to give satisfaction to a searching, equitable, and intelligent mind; and there must not be a failure of justice.

40|$|Many of our {{decisions}} depend on intuitive judgments {{that can be}} described as the capacity to implicitly evaluate the coherence of context-relevant information without being able to provide an explicit explanation. To study the neural mechanisms of implicit and explicit perception of coherence, we performed an event-related fMRI study using a semantic judgment task. Participants first had to judge whether three simultaneously presented words were coherent {{in the sense that they}} were all weakly related to a common associate or incoherent if they were not. Subsequently, participants had to provide, whenever possible, a solution word that was semantically related to the word triad, thereby allowing the following conditions: explicit perception of coherence (yes + solution), implicit perception of coherence (yes + no solution), and perception of incoherence (no + no solution). As a control condition, pseudoword triads were presented. fMRI data analysis was performed in SPM 99 employing a random-effects model. Evaluation and perception of semantic coherence was predominantly associated with neural activity in left inferior and anteromedial prefrontal regions, in the temporal cortex, precuneus, and right cerebellum. Although no explicit solution was found, these regions were already active in the implicit condition, indicating that the implicit perception of semantic coherence is primarily based on the same structures as the explicit perception, but does obviously not suffice to retrieve an explicit answer. Implicit judgments of coherence, as <b>opposed</b> to explicit <b>judgments,</b> were correlated with an additional activation of bilateral parietal regions, the right superior temporal sulcus, and the left posterior parahippocampal gyrus. The common activation of the parietal association cortex and right superior temporal sulcus in the implicit condition supports the notion that intuitive judgments are based on an associative evaluation of information coherence...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined {{theoretical and}} emotional interrelations among social values, emotion, and action. Data from nine experiments revealed some novel and important findings. Experiments 1 to 3 examined the motivational dynamics of values by observing {{the effects of}} priming motivationally <b>opposing</b> values on <b>judgment</b> and behaviour. The results showed that priming tradition values reduced the better-than-average effect, but priming stimulation values increased it. Also, priming security values increased cleanliness behaviour, but priming self-direction values decreased it. Similarly, security values decreased curiosity behaviours, but priming self-direction values increased it. These findings supported the circular model's assumption about motivational interconnections between values. Experiments 4 - 9 examined the motivational dynamics of values by observing the effects of priming emotion {{on the importance of}} motivationally opposing values. Three types of negative emotion were primed: sadness, disgust, and shame. The results revealed that the context of the emotions determined their effect on values. Experiments 4 and 5 found that death-related sadness (e. g., passing away of a family member), but not failure-related sadness, led to increased importance of self-transcendence values (e. g., helpfulness) and decreased importance of self-enhancement values (e. g., self-success). Experiments 6 and 7 found that moral disgust (e. g., terrorists), but not hygiene disgust, led to increased importance of self-transcendence values and decreased importance of self-enhancement values. Experiment 8 found that moral shame, but not performance shame, led to increased importance of conservation values (e. g., conformity) and decreased importance of openness to change values (e. g., independence). Experiment 9 found that the context of shame interacts with prior individual differences to shape values and that these effects extend to value-relevant behaviour. Together, these findings provide novel support for important assumptions about motivational interconnections between values, while connecting these assumptions to extant evidence regarding the effects of goal and value priming on action and to evidence regarding the effects of emotion on social judgment and action. In addition, the results provide novel evidence in support of the importance of emotion appraisal processes in value-relevant judgment and behaviour...|$|R

60|$|We cannot {{wonder that}} his time was incessantly employed. His was no {{ordinary}} case. He had to recover and improve upon the little education he had received, and lost again by dissipated habits. He must have made every effort, by his diligent study of the Bible, to gain that spiritual knowledge which alone could enable him to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ, and that profound internal converse with the throne of God which appears in all his writings. In addition to all this, he was engaged in continual controversy {{with a variety of}} sects, which, in his sober <b>judgment,</b> <b>opposed</b> the simplicity of the gospel. Among these the Ranters, or Sweet Singers, were very conspicuous. It is difficult to discover what were their opinions, but they appear to have been nearly like the Dutch Adamites; they were severely persecuted, by public authority, under the Commonwealth, for blasphemy. George Fox found some of them in prison at Coventry in 1649, and held a short disputation with them. They claimed each one to be GOD, founding their notion on such passages as 1 Corinthians 14:25, 'God is in you of a truth.' Fox quaintly asked them whether it would rain the next day; and upon their answering that they could not tell, 'Then said I unto them, God can tell.'[179] Strange as it may appear, the Ranters had many followers, while numerous pious people were troubled by their impudence and perversion of Scripture, but more especially by their being a persecuted people. Taking advantage of the inquiries that were excited by these strange doctrines, Bunyan determined to become an author, that he might set forth more extensively than he could do by preaching, the truths of the gospel in their native purity, simplicity, and beauty, as an antidote to fanaticism. The learned and eloquent looked with contempt upon the follies of the Ranters, Familists, and some loose Quakers, 'and only deigned to abuse them with raillery, while the poor unlettered tinker wrote against them.' To indite a work would be to him a pleasant recreation, but writing a book must have been extremely difficult, and have required extraordinary patience. This will be better seen by a specimen of his handwriting, now in the Bedford Library, found in Fox's Book of Martyrs, the three volumes of which beguiled many of his tedious hours when in prison.|$|R
60|$|In judging of {{the success}} or want of success of any {{political}} institutions or of any form of government, we should be guided, I think, by the general results, and not by any abstract rules as to the right or wrong of those institutions or of that form. It might be easy for a German lawyer to show that our system of trial by jury {{is open to the}} gravest objections, and that it sins against common sense. But if that system gives us substantial justice, and protects us from the tyranny of men in office, the German will not succeed in making us believe that it is a bad system. When looking into the matter of the schools at Boston, I observed to one of the committee of management that the statements with which I was supplied, though they told me how many of the children went to school, did not tell me how long they remained at school. The gentleman replied that that information was to be obtained from the result of the schooling of the population generally. Every boy and girl around him could read and write, and could enjoy reading and writing. There was therefore evidence to show that they remained at school sufficiently long for the required purposes. It was fair that I should judge of the system from the results. Here, in England, we generally object to much that the Americans have adopted into their form of government, and think that many of their political theories are wrong. We do not like universal suffrage. We do not like a periodical change in the first magistrate; and we like quite as little a periodical permanence in the political officers immediately under the chief magistrate; we are, in short, wedded to our own forms, and therefore <b>opposed</b> by <b>judgment</b> to forms differing from our own. But I think we all acknowledge that the United States, burdened as they are with these political evils--as we think them--have grown in strength and material prosperity with a celerity of growth hitherto unknown among nations. We may dislike Americans personally, we may find ourselves uncomfortable when there, and unable to sympathize with them when away. We may believe them to be ambitious, unjust, self-idolatrous, or irreligious; but unless we throw our judgment altogether overboard, we cannot believe them to be a weak people, a poor people, a people with low spirits or with idle hands. Now to what is it that the government of a country should chiefly look? What special advantages do we expect from our own government? Is it not that we should be safe at home and respected abroad--that laws should be maintained, but that they should be so maintained that they should not be oppressive? There are, doubtless, countries in which the government professes to do much more than this for its people--countries in which the government is paternal; in which it regulates the religion of the people, and professes to enforce on all the national children respect for the governors, teachers, spiritual pastors, and masters. But that is not our idea of a government. That is not what we desire to see established among ourselves or established among others. Safety from foreign foes, respect from foreign foes and friends, security under the law and security from the law, this is what we expect from our government; and if I add to this that we expect to have these good things provided at a fairly moderate cost, I think I have exhausted the list of our requirements. I hardly think that we even yet expect the government to take the first steps in the rudimentary education of the people. We certainly do not expect it to make the people religious, or to keep them honest.|$|R
