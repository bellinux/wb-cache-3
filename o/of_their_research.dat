5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|Coplas, {{songs and}} plays have been {{adapted from the}} oral tradition, and formal studies of the {{historical}} Cofresí and the legends surrounding him have appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ramon Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Bienvenido Camacho, Isabel Cuchí Coll, Fernando Géigel Sabat, Ramírez Brau and Cayetano Coll y Toste have published the results <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research.</b> Others inspired by the pirate include poets Cesáreo Rosa Nieves and the brothers Luis and Gustavo Palés Matos. Educators Juan Bernardo Huyke and Robert Fernández Valledor have also published on Cofresí. In mainstream media Cofresí has recently been discussed in the newspapers El Mundo, El Imparcial, El Nuevo Día, Primera Hora, El Periódico de Catalunya, Die Tageszeitung, Tribuna do Norte and The New York Times, and the magazines Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Fiat Lux and Proceedings have published articles on the pirate.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches, {{published}} by Holy Cross Orthodox Press {{and based on}} research by Alexei Krindatch, was released. It has extensive data on various Orthodox Churches in the United States, including both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups (as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups). The publication is endorsed by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops and is being used by various Assembly committees as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> and planning. The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84,900, 33,800 of which it says are regular church attendees. It lists the OCA as having 551 parishes and 19 monasteries in the United States. It also indicates the states with the heaviest concentration of OCA parishes are, in order: Alaska (with 86), Pennsylvania (with 83), California (with 43) and New York (with 41).|$|E

The 2016 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities, a ranking based on a university's scientific output, ranked McMaster 111th in the world and sixth in Canada. HEEACT placed McMaster 95th in the world and fifth nationally for its overall research performance. The University also placed in several of their subject rankings. In their 2016 ranking for social science, McMaster ranked 68th in the world and seventh in Canada. In the same year's ranking, for the field of clinical medicine McMaster ranked 51st in the world and fourth in Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E

Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
