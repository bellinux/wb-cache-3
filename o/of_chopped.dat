40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF 2 (eIF 2 α-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because {{there are multiple}} mammalian eIF 2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme {{is referred to as}} the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF 2 α-P is that encoding the transcription factor CHOP (DDIT 3 /GADD 153). Enhanced levels <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5 '-leader <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> uORF and the biological consequences of loss <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> uORF on CHOP expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within the CHOP uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at the downstream CHOP coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern <b>of</b> induction <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> expression in the ISR. Enhanced CHOP expression leads to increased expression <b>of</b> key <b>CHOP</b> target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress...|$|R

40|$|CHOP is a stress-inducible {{protein that}} acts as a {{transcription}} co-regulatory factor for genes that are involved in cellular responses to stress. Previous studies demonstrated that the activation of promoter activity <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> gene is a major mechanism underlying the increase in the mRNA level <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> gene in stressed cells. It is however not certain if the cellular mRNA degradation mechanism for CHOP mRNA might also be stress-sensitive so that together with stress-stimulated transcription a highly precise control <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA level can be achieved. To examine such a possibility, a series of CHOP-expressing plasmids were constructed and used to express the full length CHOP mRNA with or without deletion mutations in its 3 ’untranslated region in cultured cells. Realtime PCR quantitation demonstrated that the level of the expressed full length CHOP mRNA was the same in unstressed and stressed cells. Deletion mutations of the 3 UTR <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA resulted in changes of CHOP-mRNA levels relative to the wild type mRNA but otherwise such changes were not affected by cellular stress. To ascertain if deletion mutations of the 3 ’UTR <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA alone were sufficient to cause changes in mRNA levels without requiring the participation of the rest <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> mRNA sequence, another series of expression plasmids were constructed that will express EGFP mRNA having its original 3 ’UTR replaced with either the 3 ’UTR <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA, or 3 ’UTR <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA with deletions mutations the same as those of the pCHOP series of plasmids. Analysis of real-time PCR data obtained for the quantitation of mRNA levels expressed from the E 3 series of plasmids showed the same changes of the expressed mRNA levels caused by the deletion mutations in the 3 ’UTR. The changes in mRNA levels were again independent of cellular stress. To examine if the change in mRNA levels would result in proportionate changes of translation, the abundance of the reporter protein (GFP) expressed from plasmids of the E 3 -series was quantitated directly by Western blot and indirectly by measurement of FITC fluorescence by FACS analysis. The decrease in mRNA expression due to the deletion of the first 30 ribonucleotides in the 3 ’UTR CHOP is always met with more of less proportionate decrease in the reporter protein expressed from this mutant mRNA. However, the change in mRNA level expressed from other pCHOP and E 3 deletion mutants may not always cause a corresponding change in level of translational product. Results {{of this study suggest that}} unlike transcriptional synthesis <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA that is tightly stress-regulated, the degradation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA is stress-insensitive and it may only be passively involved in preventing excessive synthesis <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. The degradation <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> is closely related to the nucleotide sequence of its 3 ’UTR. Additional function of the nucleotide sequence of the 3 ’UTR <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA is also suggested by results of the present study. published_or_final_versionBiomedical SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Hippocampal {{sclerosis}} is {{a frequent}} pathological finding in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and {{can be caused by}} prolonged single or repeated brief seizures. Both DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress have been implicated as underlying molecular mechanisms in seizure-induced brain injury. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) is a transcriptional regulator induced downstream of DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can promote or inhibit apoptosis according to context. Recent work has proposed inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> as a suitable neuroprotective strategy. Here, we show that transcript and protein levels <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> increase in surviving subfields of the hippocampus after prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) in mouse models. CHOP was also elevated in the hippocampus from epileptic mice and patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The hippocampus of CHOP-deficient mice was much more vulnerable to damage in mouse models of status epilepticus. Moreover, compared with wild-type animals, CHOP-deficient mice subject to status epilepticus developed more spontaneous seizures, displayed protracted hippocampal neurodegeneration and a deficit in a hippocampus-dependent object–place recognition task. The absence <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> was associated with a supra-maximal induction of p 53 after status epilepticus, and inhibition of p 53 abolished the cell death-promoting consequences <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> deficiency. The protective effect <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> could be partly explained by activating transcription of murine double minute 2 that targets p 53 for degradation. These data demonstrate that CHOP is required for neuronal survival after seizures and caution against inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> as a neuroprotective strategy where excitotoxicity is an underlying pathomechanism.

40|$|The growth {{arrest and}} DNA damage-inducible gene CHOP (GADD 153) encodes a small nuclear protein from the C/EBP family, {{originally}} isolated from adipocytes in culture. Although inactive in cells under normal conditions, the CHOP gene is markedly induced {{by a variety}} of cellular stresses, including nutrient deprivation and metabolic perturbations. These lead to accumulation <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> protein in the nucleus. Because cellular stress normally leads to growth arrest, we examined the implication <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> in this process. Microinjection <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> expression plasmids into NIH- 3 T 3 cells blocked the cells from progressing through the cell cycle, measured by an attenuation in the fraction of cells incorporating BrdU, an S-phase marker. The precise point in the cell cycle at which CHOP acts was mapped by microinjection <b>of</b> bacterially expressed <b>CHOP</b> protein into synchronized cells [...] this blocked the cells from progressing from G 1 to S phase. This effect <b>of</b> <b>CHOP</b> was observed only when the protein was introduced early after serum stimulation suggesting that CHOP works at or around the so-called G 1 /S checkpoint. CHOP dimerizes with other C/EBP proteins and the CHOP-C/EBP dimers are directed away from "classical" C/EBP sites recognizing instead unique "nonclassical" sites. Mutant forms <b>of</b> the <b>CHOP</b> protein that lack the leucine zipper dimerization domain or the unusually structured basic region, potentially involved in DNA binding, fail to induce growth arrest. A tumor-specific form <b>of</b> <b>CHOP,</b> TLS-CHOP, that has been found so far exclusively in the human adipose tissue tumor myxoid liposarcoma, fails to cause growth arrest and furthermore interferes with the ability <b>of</b> normal <b>CHOP</b> to induce growth arrest. CHOP has been shown recently to be markedly inducible by nutritional deprivation of cells. This suggests that CHOP {{may play a role in}} an inducible growth arrest pathway that is triggered by metabolic cues and is of particular importance in adipose tissue [...] an organ that undergoes marked changes in its metabolic activity. Blocking of this pathway by TLS-CHOP may play a mechanistic role in the establishment of myxoid liposarcoma...|$|R
