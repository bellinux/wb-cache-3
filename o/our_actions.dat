5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|Thus <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> are predetermined, and are causally {{related to}} the {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. <b>Our</b> <b>actions</b> would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{argument against}} free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart {{focuses on the}} implications of determinism for 'free will'. However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we target at {{generating}} generic action pro-posals in unconstrained videos. Each action proposal cor-responds to a temporal series of spatial bounding boxes, i. e., a spatio-temporal video tube, {{which has a}} good poten-tial to locate one human action. Assuming each action is performed by a human with meaningful motion, both ap-pearance and motion cues are utilized to measure the ac-tionness of the video tubes. After picking those spatiotem-poral paths of high actionness scores, <b>our</b> <b>action</b> proposal generation is formulated as a maximum set coverage prob-lem, where greedy search is performed to select a set of action proposals that can maximize the overall actionness score. Compared with existing <b>action</b> proposal approaches, <b>our</b> <b>action</b> proposals do not rely on video segmentation and can be generated in nearly real-time. Experimental results on two challenging datasets, MSRII and UCF 101, validate the superior performance of <b>our</b> <b>action</b> proposals as well as competitive results on action detection and search. 1...|$|R

25|$|In Beyond Freedom and Dignity, Skinner {{suggests}} that a technology of behavior could help {{to make a better}} society.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approach}} for analyzing human action in video, and demonstrate its application to several related tasks: action retrieval, action classification and <b>action</b> localization. In <b>our</b> work, <b>actions</b> are rep-resented {{as a set of}} local space time features, or Action Elements, then an Implicit Shape Model of the action is built to integrate spatial and temporal correlations of these local Action Elements. In particular, we propose two different approaches to extracting Action Elements: a discriminative and a generative approach, respectively. Action Elements detected from either of the approaches are then used to build an Implicit Shape Model for current action of interest. We apply <b>our</b> <b>action</b> matching algorithm to the application of action recognition and carry out thorough experiments on the two well-known action datasets, KTH and Weizmann. Results obtained from those experiments demonstrate the highly competitive performance of <b>our</b> <b>action</b> matching algorithm compared to state-of-the-arts, and also give evaluative insights on the two proposed feature extraction approaches...|$|R

25|$|In {{the context}} of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is {{characterized}} by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} action for a six-dimensional superconformal field theory {{containing}} a non-abelian tensor multiplet.

The kinematical data contains a connection on a categorified principal bundle, which is the appropriate mathematical description of the parallel transport of self-dual strings. <b>Our</b> <b>action</b> can be written down {{for each of the}} simply laced Dynkin diagrams, and each case reduces to a four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with corresponding gauge Lie algebra. <b>Our</b> <b>action</b> also reduces nicely to an M 2 -brane model which is a deformation of the ABJM model.

25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks <b>our</b> <b>actions</b> only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E
25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of <b>our</b> <b>actions.</b> According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
