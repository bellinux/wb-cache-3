5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|Five single sheets <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> paper {{were found}} {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

5000|$|The borough {{was formed}} in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 as the London Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking.</b> The {{constituent}} parts were {{the greater part of}} the Municipal Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and the entire Municipal Borough of Dagenham, the former area of which was transferred to Greater London from Essex. At the time of the amalgamation the combined population <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham was around 180,000, the northern tip of Dagenham having been incorporated into Redbridge and a small area <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> in Newham.|$|R
5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made <b>of</b> <b>bark,</b> only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food {{coming down from the}} leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E

5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm.

Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness <b>of</b> <b>bark,</b> colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
50|$|The role of Archdeacon of West Ham {{has existed}} {{separately}} from the Bishop suffragan <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> since 1958; the archdeaconry was itself divided to create the Harlow archdeaconry following a 1989 decision of the Diocesan Synod and again on 1 February 2013, by Pastoral Order of the Bishop of Chelmsford, the new Archdeaconry <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> was created from the West Ham archdeaconry; initially, the Archdeacon of West Ham was also Acting Archdeacon <b>of</b> <b>Barking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barking Park, in the London Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham, in east London, is a park {{covering}} {{just under}} 30 hectares {{to the east}} <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> town centre. It lies north of Longbridge Road, and is near the boundary with Loxford. The park was the first council-controlled park in the Borough, and was established as a classic Victorian park in 1896. It was officially opened on 9 April 1898 by Councillor C. L. Beard JP, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> Town Urban District Council.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{building}} of the Becontree estate in the 1920s across the three districts <b>of</b> Ilford, <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham, there had been periodic discussion and review of the local government arrangements in the area. The districts were all considered to form part of the Greater London conurbation and in 1957 formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The 1960 report of the commission recommended the union <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham as a single London borough. Following the review, in 1965 the London Government Act 1963 abolished the municipal boroughs <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham, and transferred their former area from Essex to Greater London, to form the London Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking.</b> The section <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> west <b>of</b> the River Roding around Beckton became part of the London Borough of Newham.|$|R
5|$|In 1919, M-69 {{started at}} the state line south of Crystal Falls. It ran north through Crystal Falls, where it intersected M-12, to end in Covington at an {{intersection}} with M-28. This roadway was redesignated {{with the creation of}} the U.S. Highway System in 1926. US2 replaced M-69 south and M-12 west of Crystal Falls. US102 replaced M-69 north of Crystal Falls, and the latter designation was reused on the section of M-12 east of town. Where the roadway intersected M-45 (now M-95) in Sagola, M-69 joined it to Randville and then replaced M-90 east to Foster City by 1927. By 1930, the highway was extended through Menominee County into Delta County to end at an intersection with US2/US41 east <b>of</b> <b>Bark</b> River. This extension gave M-69 its current routing.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E
5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. They maintained cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how the forests rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, {{at least as far}} as Mole Creek, and lived in villages <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|E
50|$|These {{elections}} {{were the first}} to the newly formed borough. Previously elections had taken place in the Municipal Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Municipal Borough of Dagenham. These boroughs were joined to form the new London Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> by the London Government Act 1963.|$|R
50|$|The borough {{was formed}} in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 as the London Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking.</b> The {{constituent}} parts were {{almost all of the}} Municipal Borough <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and the greater part of the Municipal Borough of Dagenham. At the time of the amalgamation the combined population <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> and Dagenham was around 180,000, the northern tip of Dagenham having been incorporated into Redbridge and a small area <b>of</b> <b>Barking</b> in Newham. The borough was renamed Barking and Dagenham in 1980. In 1994 the part of the Becontree estate in Redbridge was transferred to Barking and Dagenham. The area covered by Mayesbrook Park in the Borough was once part of the historic Manor of Jenkins, seat of the Fanshawe family.|$|R

5|$|The {{innermost}} layer <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> {{is known}} as the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} for Tommy {{is set in}} {{deep space}} in a small, self-contained biosphere bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden nebula of Xibalba with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs t'ai chi, grows mushrooms and cuts pieces <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is implied that the tree within the biosphere also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba {{with the hope that}} she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is implied that the tattoos mark the passage of time on his journey in 2500.|$|E

5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East <b>of</b> <b>Bark</b> River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers <b>of</b> <b>bark</b> are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{is stored}} year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces <b>of</b> <b>bark.</b> The cached food is retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store {{the seeds of the}} Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E

50|$|A {{criticism}} of the book by Andrae is that the writers examine Disney comics originally written and drawn by Carl Barks, without actually being aware of the existence <b>of</b> <b>Barks</b> as an individual author. In fact there is no distinction in the work between the works <b>of</b> <b>Barks</b> and those <b>of</b> other Disney artists. Translator David Kunzle was aware <b>of</b> <b>Barks</b> and briefly mentions him {{in the introduction to}} the book. Neither Dorfman, nor Mattelart even once mention Barks. Another criticism is the limited sample <b>of</b> <b>Barks</b> stories actually used for the original book. Several of the stories date to the mid-1950s, when Barks was facing censorship of his work due to a new set of taboos in American comic books. These stories tend to be among the tamer ones in his canon of works.|$|R
