60|$|Fanning along against light, vagrant airs, the Rattler worked in. Calling the whale-boat on board, Grief searched out {{the shore}} with his binoculars. There was no life. In the hot blaze of tropic sun the place slept. There {{was no sign}} of welcome. Up the beach, on the north shore, where the fringe of cocoanut palms {{concealed}} the village, he could see the black bows of the canoes in the canoe-houses. On the beach, <b>on</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> rested the strange schooner. Nothing moved on board of her or around her. Not until the beach lay fifty yards away did Grief let go the anchor in forty fathoms. Out in the middle, long years before, he had sounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom, which was to be expected of a healthy crater-pit like Fuatino. As the chain roared and surged through the hawse-pipe he noticed a number of native women, lusciously large as only those of Polynesia are, in flowing ahu's, flower-crowned, stream out {{on the deck of the}} schooner on the beach. Also, and what they did not see, he saw from the galley the squat figure of a man steal for'ard, drop to the sand, and dive into the green screen of bush.|$|E
50|$|Avance was 43.20 m long {{overall and}} 42.00 m at the {{waterline}}. Her moulded breadth was 10.85 m and breadth at the waterline slightly smaller, 10.35 m. The draught of the icebreaker at maximum displacement, 900 tons, was 5.1 m <b>on</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{narrator and}} Jill {{find each other}} after failed marriages. Soon after {{they set up a}} household, their {{comfortable}} life is disrupted by the arrival of the narrator's seventy-year-old mother. She is constantly on the move, going from one place to another, hoping to find a good life, but is always disappointed by what she encounters. When she moves to her son's community, she dislikes everything about it. No sooner does she move into her quarters then she packs her possessions into boxes (the story's title) in preparation to return to California. A half year passes before she finally departs. During this time, Jill's easy going response to the mother's disruptive presence keeps the narrator and Jill's relationship <b>on</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> When the mother finally heads back to California in her packed car, both she and her son realize that they are not likely to see each other again.|$|E
5000|$|The iconic {{newsreel}} footage {{was shot}} by four newsreel camera teams: Pathé News, Movietone News, Hearst News of the Day, and Paramount News. Al Gold of Fox Movietone News later received a Presidential Citation for his work. One {{of the most widely}} circulated photographs of the disaster (see photo at top of article), showing the airship crashing with the mooring mast in the foreground, was photographed by Sam Shere of International News Photos. When the fire started {{he did not have the}} time to put the camera to his eye and shot the photo [...] "from the hip". Murray Becker of the Associated Press photographed the fire engulfing the airship while it was still <b>on</b> <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> using his 4 x 5 Speed Graphic camera. His next photograph (see right), shows flames bursting out of the nose as the bow telescoped upwards. In addition to professional photographers, spectators also photographed the crash. They were stationed in the spectator's area near Hangar No. 1, and had a side-rear view of the airship. Customs broker Arthur Cofod Jr. and 16 year-old Foo Chu both had Leica cameras with high speed film, allowing them to take a larger number of photographs than the press photographers. Nine of Cofod's photographs were printed in LIFE magazine [...] while Chu's photographs were shown New York Daily News.|$|E

6000|$|The two {{had hardly}} {{got out of}} the [...] "city," [...] and the {{thoroughly}} bad character of the road was already apparent.

60|$|While Tim Rokens {{was thus}} recounting his ghostly experiences, and moralising thereon, {{for the benefit}} of his comrades, the silent tide was stealthily {{creeping}} up the sides of the Red Eric, and placing her gradually <b>on</b> an <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> At the same time a British man-of-war was creeping down upon that innocent vessel with the murderous intention of blowing her out of the water, if possible.|$|R

50|$|By 1236, {{the cruiser}} was back <b>on</b> an <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> Thirty minutes later, all major fires were out, and salvage {{work had been}} started.

5000|$|Their third album, Shanghaied! (November 1981), was co-produced by the band's members, {{mostly by}} Burns and Stanton, {{together}} with John L Sayers and Dave Marett.

60|$|We {{remained}} {{side by side}} {{talking in}} our secret way--but sometimes silent or just exchanging a whispered word or two at long intervals. And as usual he stared through the port.

50|$|In 2007 Cork {{narrowly}} {{lost their}} Munster crown to Kerry. In {{spite of the}} 1-15 to 1-13 defeat Cork still had another chance to claim the All-Ireland title.

5000|$|Lexingtons {{damage control}} parties brought the fires under control, {{and the ship}} {{was still able to}} {{continue}} flight operations despite the damage.
