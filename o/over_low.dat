5|$|The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) {{begins at}} the Four Level Interchange, a {{symmetrical}} stack interchange {{on the north side}} of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and <b>over</b> <b>low</b> areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes.|$|E

With biryani, the rice is boiled or parboiled separately in spiced water and then layered with meat curry or marinade (depending {{on the type of}} biryani), then sealed and cooked <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat until done. The vegetarian version is called tehri.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{of human}} rights abuses have arisen from Chinese-African co-operation. African workers have protested against ill-treatment and poor pay by Chinese companies, as well as the influx of Chinese workers who take away local jobs. In July 2010, {{hundreds}} of African workers at a Chinese-owned Zambian mine rioted <b>over</b> <b>low</b> wages.|$|E

25|$|Generally, French {{preparations}} of {{foie gras}} are made <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat, as fat melts faster {{from the traditional}} goose foie gras than the duck foie gras produced in most {{other parts of the}} world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck foie gras, have more recipes and dish preparations for serving foie gras hot, rather than cool or cold.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{zucchini}} is a {{key ingredient}} in ratatouille, a stew of summer fruits and vegetables prepared in olive oil and cooked for an extended time <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat. The dish, originating near present-day Nice, is served {{as a side dish}} or on its own at lunch with bread. Zucchini may be stuffed with meat or with other fruits such as tomatoes or bell peppers in a dish called courgette farcie (stuffed zucchini).|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2006, {{tensions}} boiled over at {{the construction}} site of the Burj Khalifa, as workers upset <b>over</b> <b>low</b> wages and poor working conditions rioted, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction tools. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused approximately US$1 million in damage. On 22 March most workers returned to the construction site but refused to work. Workers building a new terminal at Dubai International Airport went on strike in sympathy.|$|E

25|$|In 1796, German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz {{obtained}} pure ethanol {{by mixing}} partially purified ethanol (the alcohol-water azeotrope) with {{an excess of}} anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and in 1807 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure determined ethanol's chemical formula. Fifty years later, Archibald Scott Couper published the structural formula of ethanol. It {{was one of the}} first structural formulas determined.|$|E
25|$|The Cell {{architecture}} {{includes a}} memory coherence architecture that emphasizes power efficiency, prioritizes bandwidth <b>over</b> <b>low</b> latency, and favors peak computational throughput over simplicity of program code. For these reasons, Cell {{is widely regarded}} as a challenging environment for software development. IBM provides a Linux-based development platform to help developers program for Cell chips. The architecture will not be widely used unless it is adopted by the software development community. However, Cell's strengths may make it useful for scientific computing regardless of its mainstream success.|$|E

25|$|The 1872 work {{stoppage}} {{did not result}} in the formation of police union. Most of the police would not have considered forming a union, as they considered the police a quasi-military institution. Despite the tens of men dismissed after the 1872 strike, members of the Metropolitan Force later took action again. In July 1890 they conducted a {{work stoppage}} <b>over</b> <b>low</b> police pensions. The government argued {{that it would not be}} held hostage by their demands, but Parliament passed the Police Pensions Bill (1890) to address inequities, in a matter of weeks.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{vegetation}} communities of lesser extent, including some that are considered endangered or at risk. Most notable is the critically endangered community of Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita and Tecticornia verrucosa that occurs on the lake beds of the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland system. Gypsum dunes support a vulnerable ecological community of herblands and bunch grasslands, and an at-risk community of Eucalyptus aff. incrassata <b>over</b> <b>low</b> scrub; at least 80 plant species are likely to occur only on gypsum dunes, including several threatened species. Some plant communities of the Bremer Range are also considered vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{expenditure}} {{was on the}} construction teams, called [...] "crews", who built the forts. The numbers of workers varied {{during the course of}} the project, driven in part by seasonal variation, but the teams were substantial: Sandgate Castle, for example, saw an average of 640 men on the site daily during June 1540, and the work at Hull required a team of 420. A skilled worker was paid between 7 and 8 pence a day, a labourer between 5 and 6 pence, with trades including stonemasons, carpenters, carters, lime burners, sawyers, plumbers, scavelmen, dikers and bricklayers. Finding enough workers proved difficult, and in some cases men had to be pressed into service unwillingly. Labour disputes broke out, with strikes <b>over</b> <b>low</b> pay at Deal in 1539 and at Guisnes in 1541; both were quickly suppressed by royal officials.|$|E

5000|$|Lactose {{malabsorption}} [...] - [...] {{the patient}} takes a base reading of hydrogen levels in his/her breath. The patient is then given {{a small amount}} of pure lactose (typically 20 to 25 g), and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours. If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) <b>over</b> the <b>lowest</b> preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a lactose malabsorber. If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm <b>over</b> the <b>lowest</b> preceding value to be considered positive. If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm <b>over</b> the <b>lowest</b> preceding value.|$|R

500|$|In battle, {{the player}} {{controls}} Zael alone, {{with the rest}} of the party being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and directed by player commands. Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five [...] "lives", with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually. The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters. Combat plays out in real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting <b>over</b> <b>low</b> obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls. During combat, a character's Tension gauge will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.|$|E
500|$|The Pullman Strike had a {{significantly}} greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the Pullman Company <b>over</b> <b>low</b> wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V. Debs, soon followed. By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce. Because the railroads carried the mail, and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership, Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate. Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers. [...] "If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago", he proclaimed, [...] "that card will be delivered." [...] Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P. Altgeld of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, {{but the use of}} troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.|$|E
500|$|The Marina Bay Street Circuit was resurfaced between turns {{three and}} seven, along with turns {{thirteen}} to seventeen, after drivers complained about its bumpiness following the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The Singapore Sling chicane was adjusted {{to allow for}} a more gradual curve to exist which enabled a safer exit for drivers. The outside wall at turn 21 was brought closer towards the race track to cover up half of a drain which was previously exposed to cars, and the pit lane was resurfaced {{to allow for a}} smoother exit for drivers rejoining the circuit. Hamilton, a vocal critic of the circuit's condition, described it as [...] "dangerous" [...] because it had remained uneven, and said the Singapore Sling chicane was [...] "the worst corner I have ever driven in Formula One" [...] despite the safety modifications made to it. The organisers of the Singapore Grand Prix introduced a new machine to clean the surface of the track after drivers had problems with a dusty and slippery track surface in the previous year's race. Two days before the first practice session, drivers expressed concerns <b>over</b> <b>low</b> visibility caused by rain showers combined with the glare from the circuit lighting.|$|E

500|$|In July 1940, Edward was {{appointed}} Governor of the Bahamas. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the American Export Lines steamship Excalibur, which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to New York City {{so that they}} could be dropped off at Bermuda on the 9th. They left Bermuda for Nassau on the Canadian steamship Lady Somers on 15 August, arriving two days later. The Duke did not enjoy being governor and referred to the islands as [...] "a third-class British colony". The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring. The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of Étienne Dupuch, the editor of the Nassau Daily Tribune: [...] "It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium." [...] He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest <b>over</b> <b>low</b> wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on [...] "mischief makers – communists" [...] and [...] "men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft". He resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.|$|E
