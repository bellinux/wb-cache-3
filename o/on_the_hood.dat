25|$|Lütjens radioed Wilhelmshaven and Berlin and all {{the naval}} {{commands}} concerning the sinking of Hood continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard Prinz Eugen Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that Lütjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final “Execute!” order, was unnecessary and risky. In {{the morning of the}} 25 May, his 52nd birthday, Lütjens persisted by sending a long message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{suffered}} {{heavy losses}} {{in the first two}} years of the war, including the carriers HMS Courageous, Glorious and Ark Royal, the battleships HMS Royal Oak and Barham and the battlecruiser HMS Hood in the European Theatre, and the carrier HMS Hermes, the battleship HMS Prince of Wales, the battlecruiser HMS Repulse and the heavy cruisers HMS Exeter, Dorsetshire and Cornwall in the Asian Theatre. Of the 1,418 men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood,</b> only three survived its sinking. Over 3,000 people were lost when the converted troopship Lancastria was sunk in June 1940, the greatest maritime disaster in Britain's history. There were however also successes against enemy surface ships, as in the battles of the River Plate in 1939, Narvik in 1940 and Cape Matapan in 1941, and the sinking of the German capital ships Bismarck in 1941 and Scharnhorst in 1943.|$|E
25|$|The {{live action}} {{television}} series {{was so popular}} that its campy humor and its Batmobile (a superficially modified concept car, the decade-old Lincoln Futura, owned by George Barris whose shop did the work) were quickly introduced into the Batman comic books. But the high camp and general silliness of the television show did {{not sit well with}} long-time Batman comic book fans. So, when the series was canceled in 1968, the comic books reacted by becoming darker and more serious, including having Batman abandon that Batmobile. Its replacement {{for a number of years}} was a much simpler model with a stylized bat's head silhouette decal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> being the only decoration of note. The 1960s TV style Batmobile still appears from time to time in the comic books, most recently in Detective Comics #850 and the issues of Batman Confidential.|$|E

Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com.
