5|$|After Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond {{was hired}} in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|In her investigation, Leslie quickly learns Joe merely hits on {{any woman}} {{as long as}} she is not elderly. She takes Tom out to lunch to learn more about him. He {{responds}} to all of Leslie's questions with his usual chauvinistic answers, annoying her to the point that she admits she took him <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> matched on HoosierMate. A delighted Tom teases Leslie {{the rest of the day}} by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him. Chris notices the kiss and warns Leslie that he has a strict policy against workplace dating.|$|E
5|$|Neo and Rebecca Leow co-wrote the script, {{which was}} {{completed}} in May 2005. I Not Stupid Too was produced by MediaCorp Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce I Not Stupid Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> found the film too liberal. The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui Yin and Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E

2500|$|David Clark, {{writing in}} The Guardian, argues against this that [...] "instances of anti-capitalism {{spilling}} into 'rich Jew' bigotry are ... well documented" [...] but [...] "stand <b>out</b> precisely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> conflict so {{sharply with the}} Left’s universalism and its opposition to ethnic discrimination".|$|R
25|$|The Zacapoaxtlas stand <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{have the}} most {{elaborate}} and costly costumes. They dress as charros, which suits heavily decorated in sequins, a wig with {{the colors of the}} Mexican flag and a black cape. Representing the troops of General Zaragoza in the Battle of Puebla, they wear green, white and red paper streamers that hang off the back of their hats. Their suits are elaborated embroidered and sequined which has been hand done. These outfits have been valued at about 30,000 and sometimes as high as 50,000 pesos.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E
25|$|The bishop's reeve in the {{southern}} Grisons, Benedikt Fontana, {{was forced to leave}} his seat on the Fürstenburg at Burgeis in the Vinschgau. He had called repeatedly to have strong troops sent to interfere with the preparations of the Habsburg army. The Three Leagues finally complied and assembled an army of about 6,300 men at Zuoz and marched to the Val Müstair. They knew that their time was running <b>out,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had news of Maximilian being on his way with reinforcements. But the Letzi seemed an insurmountable barrier. The Habsburg army numbered some 12,000 men, of which 2,000 manned the fortifications themselves, while another 1,200 covered the flanks. Castle Rotund at Taufers in front of the barrier was also manned with Habsburg troops, and 200 men guarded the bridge at Marengo behind the Letzi. The rest of the Habsburg army camped at the villages in the Vinschgau.|$|E

25|$|Jason and Sam {{first met}} {{when they were}} both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard). The two have often been caught in {{situations}} where they were in trouble with the law. The two started to interact more after Sam got involved with a married Sonny, and Jason tried to pay her off so that Sonny would go back to his wife, Carly (then Tamara Braun). Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after Jason was assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny’s child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not in love and she still has feelings for Sonny.|$|E
500|$|That night Kennedy {{returned}} to Washington D.C.. He {{walked in on}} his family having dinner at Hickory Hill, highly agitated and, {{in the words of}} his daughter Kathleen, [...] "ashen faced." [...] He announced to his children, [...] "In Mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are covered with sores and their tummies stick <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have no food. Do you know how lucky you are? Do you know how lucky you are?

500|$|The Webley Mk VI (.455) and Mk IV (.38/200) revolvers {{were still}} issued to British and Commonwealth Forces after the Second World War; {{there were now}} {{extensive}} stockpiles of the revolvers in military stores. An armourer stationed in West Germany recalled (admittedly tongue-in-cheek) {{that by the time}} they were officially retired in 1963, the ammunition allowance was [...] "two cartridges per man, per year." [...] This lack of ammunition was instrumental in keeping the Enfield and Webley revolvers in use so long: they were not wearing <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were not being used.|$|E
50|$|The fetal {{position}} {{is also one}} of the most comfortable and familiar positions to the human, as they remain in the position for the last two trimesters of pregnancy.

500|$|Several {{months before}} Bass was {{scheduled}} to fly, the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through. Bass's camp turned to MTV, who initially agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over [...] "payment, insurance, and indemnification issues." [...] Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission. Bass was eventually rejected from the program, and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts Yury Lonchakov, Sergei Zalyotin and Belgium's Frank De Winne.|$|E
500|$|The Coens {{edited the}} film themselves, as is their custom. [...] "We prefer a {{hands-on}} approach," [...] Joel explained in 1996, [...] "rather than {{sitting next to}} someone and telling them what to cut." [...] Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, {{they are required to}} use a pseudonym; [...] "Roderick Jaynes" [...] is credited with editing Barton Fink. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the movie, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "too conventional".|$|E
500|$|The Bailey {{household}} {{was very}} religious; Rose {{and his family}} attended a Pentecostal church, where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school. Rose later recalled an oppressive upbringing, stating, [...] "We'd have televisions one week, then my stepdad would throw them <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were Satanic. I wasn't allowed to listen to music. Women were evil. Everything was evil." [...] He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister. Rose found solace in music from an early age. He sang in the church choir {{from the age of}} five, and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio. At Jefferson High School, he participated in the school chorus and studied piano. A second baritone, Rose began developing [...] "different voices" [...] during chorus practice to confuse his teacher. He eventually formed a band with his friends, one of whom was Jeff Isbell, later known as Izzy Stradlin.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} upon the album's versatility, {{specifically}} that of Taylor's vocal range and abilities. Jeff Modzelewski praised the opening track [...] "Get Inside" [...] explaining, [...] "the scorching speed-metal verse and screaming chorus are played off pretty well against the melodic pre-chorus". Jason D. Taylor cited [...] "Orchids" [...] and [...] "Take a Number" [...] as songs which stand <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> [...] "strike with surprising force {{for an alternative}} rock group". On a similar note, Don Kaye said the album includes some [...] "sinister, groove-oriented metal gems that refreshingly stay away from nu metal cliches". The most melodic track on the album, [...] "Bother", received specific attention from most reviewers. Modzelewski said that the track [...] "seems to be the song that the album has been preparing everyone for", further adding that Taylor proves [...] "that he is a legitimate vocalist who doesn't need to rely on destroying his vocal chords {{to make a good}} song". In his review, Rowan Shaeffer stated the track was a specific highlight, but said that the change in style was [...] "at odds {{with the rest of the}} material" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people might buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put <b>out,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> didn't like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Collectively, the/a crest. Long crest {{feathers}} {{are sometimes}} called quill feathers. Also defined herewith: recumbent crests and recursive crests. A type of [...] feather {{with a long}} [...] with [...] on either side, that often presents as a prominent tuft on the [...] and (or through) the neck and upper [...] Birds with crests include Victoria crowned pigeons, northern lapwings, macaroni penguins and others, but the most recognizable are cockatoos and cockatiels, which can raise or lower their crests at will {{and use them to}} communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defence to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised. In some species the position of the crest is a threat signal {{that can be used to}} predict behaviour. In Steller's jays, for example, a raised crest indicates a likelihood of attack, and a lowered crest indicates a likelihood of retreat. Crests can be recumbent or recursive, depending on the species. The recumbent crest, such as in white cockatoos, has feathers that are straight and lie down essentially flat on the head until fanned out. The recursive crest, such as in sulphur-crested cockatoos and Major Mitchell's cockatoos, is noticeable even when its feathers are not fanned <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> curve upward at the tips even when lying flat, and when standing up, often bend slightly forward toward the front of the head. Some birds, like galahs and rose-breasted cockatoos, have modified crests that have both recumbent and recursive features.|$|E

50|$|The {{second of}} the {{principles}} is that of antithesis. While some habits are serviceable, Darwin proposed that some actions or habits are carried <b>out</b> merely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are opposite in nature to a serviceable habit, but are not serviceable themselves. Shrugging of the shoulders is an example Darwin used of antithesis, because it has no service. Shoulder shrugging is a passive expression, and very opposite of a confident or aggressive expression.|$|R

She married William Wharton in 1817 and together they pursued their interest in Quaker spirituality and simplicity, becoming part of the Hicksite Quaker movement. The Hicksite Friends favored simplicity and directness in their daily lives, contrasting with the more [...] "worldly" [...] urban (Orthodox) Quakers. In this respect the Fishers and Whartons stood <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were wealthy and urban, but were nostalgic about living the farming life.|$|E
2500|$|A {{structural}} domain is {{an element}} of the protein's overall structure that is self-stabilizing and often folds independently {{of the rest of the}} protein chain. Many domains are not unique to the protein products of one gene or one gene family but instead appear in a variety of proteins. Domains often are named and singled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> figure prominently in the biological function of the protein they belong to; for example, the [...] "calcium-binding domain of calmodulin". Because they are independently stable, domains can be [...] "swapped" [...] by genetic engineering between one protein and another to make chimera proteins.|$|E
