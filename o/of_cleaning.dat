5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> symbioses {{has been}} debated by {{biologists}} for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing the fitness of both individuals. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} parasitism.|$|E
5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E

40|$|Fouling layers on hot {{surfaces}} in food processing lines have frequently to be cleaned. Up to now, an inline monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning</b> process does not exist. Therefore, the cleaning {{is based on}} empirical knowledge and occasional optical inspections. The article presents a planar capacitive sensor together with an impedance spectroscopic measurement method and a multivariate signal evaluation to monitor the cleaning process. The result of the signal evaluation is a numerical cleaning indicator, which shows the progress <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning.</b> A steady state <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning</b> indicator signals the end <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning</b> proc-ess.

5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount of pollution. Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E

It is based at the County Offices in Newland, Lincoln. Navenby has one representative on this council, Marianne Overton, who also represents Branston ward. Following the election of May 2010, Navenby is represented at government level by Stephen Phillips, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency. The former MP, the Right Honorable Douglas Hogg QC, stood down from the post before the election after having {{to pay back the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> his moat.|$|E

In Section Two, I estimate the effect of several of these factors on the United States infant mortality rate, as well as the Pittsburgh infant mortality rate. I find that the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> market milk and the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> drinking water are associated with significant decreases in infant mortality. My analysis suggests that the effect <b>of</b> the national <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> market milk was greater than the effect <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> water...|$|R
5|$|On December 31, 1999, Moscoso {{oversaw the}} {{handover}} of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Her government then faced the challenge <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> up environmental {{problems in the}} Canal Zone, where the US Army had long tested bombs, biological agents, and chemical weapons. Remaining issues included lead contamination, unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration. At the same time, Panama's economy began to struggle due {{to the loss of}} income from American canal personnel.|$|E
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics <b>of</b> <b>cleaning,</b> repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. Poling, and the Democrat, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his party affiliation to the Democrats in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E

5|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> teeth is {{to remove}} plaque, which {{consists}} mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1929 there were {{suggestions}} that the castle {{should be taken}} under French control. On 16November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into {{the control of the}} French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> and restoration was carried out by a force of 120workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.|$|E

5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed <b>of.</b> <b>Cleaning</b> porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E
