5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and <b>other</b> <b>glassware.</b> It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

50|$|Most {{laboratory}} glassware is currently mass-produced, but large laboratories may employ a glass blower to construct specialized pieces. This construction forms a specialized field of glassblowing requiring precise control of shape and dimension. In addition to repairing expensive or difficult-to-replace glassware, scientific glassblowing commonly involves fusing together various glass parts—such as glass joints and tubing, stopcocks, transition pieces, and/or <b>other</b> <b>glassware</b> {{or parts of}} them to form items of glassware, such as vacuum manifolds, special reaction flasks, etc.|$|E
50|$|From 1876 through 1881, {{the company}} {{produced}} an extensive line of lighting goods and <b>other</b> <b>glassware,</b> including glass chimneys, fine cut blown glass and pressed glassware. In the 1880s, the company primarily produced art glass. In 1885, it introduced Burmese art glass, a translucent, heat reactive glass that shades from yellow {{at the bottom}} to pink at the top. The company became known {{for this type of}} glass, obtaining a British patent for it in 1886, and presenting a number of Burmese pieces to Queen Victoria.|$|E
50|$|During the Great Depression {{the mostly}} mountainous regions {{populated}} by the German minority, {{together with other}} peripheral regions of Czechoslovakia, were hurt by the economic depression more than {{the interior of the}} country. Unlike the less developed regions (Ruthenia, Moravian Wallachia), the Sudetenland had a high concentration of vulnerable export-dependent industries (such as glass works, textile industry, paper-making, and toy-making industry). Sixty percent of the bijouterie and glass-making industry were located in the Sudetenland, 69% of employees in this sector were Germans speaking according to mother tongue, and 95% of bijouterie and 78% of <b>other</b> <b>glassware</b> was produced for export. The glass-making sector was affected by decreased spending power and also by protective measures in other countries and many German workers lost their work.|$|E

In subsequent years, the company diversified into consumer cooking and dining glassware. By the 1960s, the company had mastered the process of manufacturing stemware and <b>other</b> finer <b>glassware</b> products.

50|$|Like a beaker, {{the bottom}} is flat, with the sides meeting the bottom at a 90 degree angle. The sides are {{vertical}} {{for most of the}} height; near the top, the sides curve in to form a neck with a widely flared rim. The wide rim makes it easier to pour from or filter into; the narrow neck reduces loss of the contents due to splashing and serves as a grip for handling and pouring. Fleaker containers have a plastic lid with a built in rubber stopper. When on the Fleaker, the lid covers the narrow neck. Fleaker containers work as well as <b>other</b> <b>glassware</b> for liquids and solutions, but are inappropriate for slurries, precipitates, and recrystallizations (since the narrow neck makes it difficult to remove solids completely from a Fleaker).|$|E

5000|$|A Wire gauze is a {{sheet of}} thin metal that has net-like crosses or a wire mesh. Wire gauze {{is placed on the}} support ring that is {{attached}} to the retort stand between the Bunsen burner and the beakers in order to support the beakers or <b>other</b> <b>glassware</b> or flasks during heating. Moreover, the glassware has to be flat-bottomed to stay on the wire gauze. The wire gauze is made of a [...] This type of material provides long life expectancy and can be used over and over again without a risk of it being torn. The sides/corners of the wire gauze are turned inward to help prevent fraying, improve handling and reduce safety risk from protruding ends of wire. The wire gauze is an important piece of supporting equipment in a laboratory because beakers or any type of glassware cannot be heated directly with a flame from the Bunsen burner, and the wire gauze will help protect the glassware. There are two types of wire gauze: woven wire gauze and a wire gauze with a ceramic center. These two types of wire gauze that are made of metal have the same ability to transmit the heat efficiently, but the gauze with a ceramic center will allow the heat to be dispersed more evenly. The ceramic {{at the center of the}} wire gauze is enmeshed at high pressure to prevent it from peeling. There are three sizes of wire gauze with ceramic center: 4 inches, 5 inches, and 6 inches, so that different sizes of glassware can be accommodated.|$|E
50|$|Glass {{centrifuge}} tubes can be {{used with}} most solvents, but tend to be more expensive. They can be cleaned like <b>other</b> laboratory <b>glassware,</b> and can be sterilized by autoclaving. They must be handled with care, since small scratches can cause failure under the strong forces imposed during a run. Glass tubes are inserted into soft rubber sleeves to cushion them during runs. Plastic centrifuge tubes, especially tend to be less expensive and, with care, can be just as durable as glass. Water is preferred when plastic centrifuge tubes are used. They are more difficult to clean thoroughly, and are usually inexpensive enough to be considered disposable.|$|R
50|$|When in use, {{laboratory}} glassware is often {{held in place}} with clamps made for that purpose, which are likewise attached and {{held in place by}} stands or racks. This article covers aspects of {{laboratory glassware}} which may be common to several kinds of glassware and may briefly describe a few glassware items not covered in <b>other</b> articles. Describing <b>glassware</b> can be complicated since manufacturers provide conflicting names for glassware. For example, what ChemGlass calls a glass stopcock, Kontes calls a glass plug.|$|R
50|$|The various {{artifacts}} excavated {{from the}} ancient tombs in Gyeongju - the capital of Silla Kingdom (57 BCE ~ 935 AD) - indicate that there was already frequent trades between Silla and <b>other</b> worlds. Roman-style <b>glassware</b> artifacts excavated prove the exchange and trade between Silla and the Western world. According to the writings of Roman historian Dio Cassius, Romans saw high-quality silk {{for the first time}} in 53 BCE, in the form of Parthian banners unfurled before the Roman defeat at the battle of Carrhae.|$|R

50|$|When {{connecting}} glassware, it {{is often}} tempting to use Keck clips on every joint, but this can be dangerous if the system is sealed or the exhaust is in any way restricted; e.g. by wash flasks or drying media. Many reactions and forms of operation can produce sudden, unexpected surges of pressure inside the glass. If the system is sealed or restricted, this can blow the glass apart. It is safer to only clip the joints that need holding together to stop them falling apart and to purposefully leave one or more unclipped; preferably those that are connected to lightweight, small objects like stoppers, thermometers or wash heads, that are pointing vertically upwards and not connected to <b>other</b> items of <b>glassware.</b> By doing so, any significant surge of pressure will cause these specifically chosen tapers to open and vent. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is safer and {{easier to deal with}} a controlled escape as opposed to the entire volume being uncontrollably released in an explosion.|$|R

Although it has been purified to the point where intravenous injections of 30 - 40 #g will cause a respectable fever (about 0. 7 °C) in rabbits (16, 17), homogeneity of the final product has not been achieved (14 - 17). In the present experiments disc electrophoresis has been used to separate the pyrogen from other proteins in partially purified preparations. The product thus isolated {{has been shown to be}} electrophoretically homogeneous at pH 9 and pH 3. 8.
