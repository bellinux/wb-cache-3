40|$|In {{drawing up}} the {{negotiating}} stance of the Philippines {{in light of}} the Philippines-European Union (PH-EU) free trade agreement (FTA), it is important to articulate its <b>offensive</b> and defensive <b>interests.</b> Indications of the <b>offensive</b> and defensive <b>interests</b> can be gleaned from standard measures of competitiveness as well as complementarities of the partners. However, in operational terms, negotiators would require analysis that is carried out at more specific tariff levels. This paper proposes the framework to generate different offensive and defensive lists of commodities in the non-agricultural sector as input to the Philippine negotiators. Because the criteria that is used in generating the offensive and defensive lists is purely economic in nature, the negotiators are expected to weigh in the political and non-economic criteria to determine the final lists for negotiations in the PH-EU FTA...|$|R

This paper covers the key issues under the purview of the GATS from an Indian perspective and makes important policy suggestions for India on certain sensitive sectors like retail, higher education, audio-visual and legal services. The author argues that India needs to reconsider and reassess its aggressive policy stance on services.

However, globalisation and the dual process of internationalisation of domestic affairs and domestification {{of international affairs}} imply that the days when foreign policy was the exclusive domain of the executive are over. The article explores the effects of globalisation {{on the role of}} Parliament in international relations in general, and WTO negotiations specifically, using the Norwegian Parliament as an illustration. Three findings are presented. First, at the international level attempts are made to develop a parliamentary dimension of the WTO. Second, at the national level the Norwegian Parliament has become more actively engaged in international relations. And, third, the Norwegian Parliament {{plays an important role in}} the processes of defining national interests and determining national negotiation positions in the WTO, especially with regard to possible trade-offs between the <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> of fisheries and the defensive interests of agriculture. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, the European Union (EU) {{initiated}} {{negotiations for}} regional trade agreements (RTAs) with the United States (U.

Both countries have strong <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> in audio-visual services, a sector in which the cultural exception is a symbolic defensive interest to the EU. Firstly, this report sets the scene: what is the audio-visual services sector and how does it relate to the cultural exception? It also addresses some key legal concerns surrounding EU practice in its RTAs. Subsequently, it assesses how the U. S. and Japan have addressed audio-visual services in RTAs with counterparties with similar defensive interests. The four case studies are NAFTA (as concerns Canada), the U. S. -Korea RTA, the Japan-India RTA and the Japan-Switzerland RTA. It concludes with some possible recommendations for the EU. nrpages: 57 status: publishe...|$|E

It basically, underlines Turkey’s unique negotiating position; de jure developing, de facto an advanced economy {{status in the}} WTO Doha NAMA negotiations. At Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, WTO members agreed to initiate negotiations to further liberalize trade, among other areas, on non-agricultural goods. For this purpose, the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NGMA) was created at {{the first meeting of}} the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO, in early 2002. Turkey has been quite active since then in NAMA negotiations in calibrating its position between offensive and defensive negotiation <b>interests</b> although its <b>offensive</b> market access <b>interests</b> largely outweigh defensive one. Turkey has also been propagating an offensive non-linear tariff cutting Swiss Formula approach at the WTO to curb the international high tariffs, tariff peaks and escalations. Having a strong <b>offensive</b> market access <b>interests,</b> Turkey mainly aims at large developing country markets diversifying its trade portfolio away from traditional markets towards large developing economies. From the perspective of governance, Turkey has serious constraints on its trade and industry policy space stemming from the Turkey-EU Customs Union (CU). Although Turkey is a de jure developing country in the WTO and will have all legal rights and mobligations stemming from the outcome of the DOHA, in practice, Turkey will have to implement the same applied common external tariffs of the EU. Despite the constraints and dilemmas stemming from the EU-Turkey customs union, it can be strongly argued that, it is in Turkey’s industrial interests to be actively involved in the WTO to tackle the high tariffs, tariff peaks and escalations which hinders Turkey’s exports to the world markets...|$|R

The results suggest that the US agri-food sectors would gain from both agreements while almost all their partners and third countries would benefit less, and might register losses in some sectors. However, the two agreements are not competing, since all the contracting parties' defensive and <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> are complementary.

40|$|The Pacific Islands are small, {{developing}} island {{states which}} are challenged by their small size, geographical isolation and the unvaried production possibilities. Increased trade in services, {{facilitated by the}} ICT revolution, may provide for some much needed economic development. After assessing the offensive potential for services in this complex region, this paper addresses the services liberalisation negotiations in which the Pacific Islands are partaking, both intra- and inter-regionally. While intra-regional economic integration is insufficiently moving forward, the on-going inter-regional liberalisation negotiations, i. e. with the European Union, and with Australia and New Zealand, are unlikely to cater for the Pacific’s <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> in services. Therefore, and to avoid excessive negotiation costs and implementation difficulties, {{it is argued that}} the Pacific would better halt all on-going talks and seek accession to one of two mega-regional trade negotiations around the Pacific rim: the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This report {{assesses the}} {{openness}} of public procurement markets in key third countries {{of interest to the}} EU. It provides a comparative overview of the regulatory and market access characteristics of the US, Brazil, India, China, Japans’ procurement markets, with reference to the procurement regulation and enforcement within the EU. The report assesses the available data on both the de jure and de facto levels of openness of these markets to put forward some conclusions of value to policy making both within the EU and in its trading relations with key third countries. This assessment concludes that the lack of comprehensive comparable data on procurement contract awards, particularly at the sub-central level, is not a trivial challenge for policy makers. Nevertheless, it is evident that the liberalisation of procurement markets continues to take place on a strictly reciprocal basis – linked to the <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> of governments. Given the slow-down in negotiating mega-regional agreements with comprehensive procurement chapters, the WTO Government Procurement Agreement remains the most efficient and transparent forum for undertaking further liberalisation in public procurement...|$|E
40|$|The {{decline of}} {{manufacturing}} in OECD countries and job implications {{has been a}} long-time concern. Recently, policy-makers have set out for reindustrialisation. A trend related to these concerns and aspirations is the servicification of manufacturing – the increase in use, produce and sales of services. However, servicification of firms and its role for foreign trade and policy have only received limited attention. This paper reviews micro- level evidence and discusses trade policy implications. Servicification is found in several countries, including China, and {{there are indications that}} imported, domestic and exported services are key for the competitiveness of today’s manufacturing firms and their participation in international value chains. Therefore, the historic divides in trade-policy-making between trade in manufactures and services, between <b>offensive</b> and defensive <b>interests,</b> and between modes of supply are largely antiquated. Potential trade policy implications also include to: reform how governments consult business for trade negotiations; facilitate cross-border movement of persons; and cut tariffs on services embodied and embedded in manufactures and their sales.  Tjänstefiering och internationalisering av tillverkningsindustri...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} view of {{the first}} amendment 2 ̆ 7 s free speech guarantee as absolute, allowing few and narrow exceptions, reflects the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s dedication to an open and unfettered exchange of ideas. Those thoughts that are abhorrent to a free society, the argument goes, will wither when aired but fester if suppressed. Moreover, who is to decide which ideas are <b>offensive?</b> The <b>interests</b> of the state may well be inferior to those of the people, the wisdom of public servants often suspect in quality and motivation. But freedom of speech is so precious and delicate a liberty it must be preserved at great cost: thus the depth of conviction of Voltaire 2 ̆ 7 s oft-quoted declaration, 2 ̆ 2 I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it. 2 ̆ 2 One may not justify a rule of absolute construction merely by asserting {{that it is difficult to}} draw a line between acceptable and nonacceptable expression or to allocate responsibility for deciding what speech requires restriction. The carefully delineated exceptions to the rule of free speech, such as obscenity, libel and fighting words, as well as the recognition of legitimate time, place and manner restrictions are all based on the premise that the first amendment was not intended to protect certain utterances. In recent years there has been growing support for yet another exception: the destructive attack on a target group of people by stimulating hatred or fear in others, i. e., racial defamation. Does such a restriction pass constitutional muster? Thirty years ago in Beauharnais v. Illinois, the Court answered that question in the affirmative. Although Beauharnais has not been overruled, recent opinions have questioned its vitality. Subsequent changes to the law of libel have led some to believe that group libel statutes would not survive constitutional challenge today. In Collin v. Smith, furthermore, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the enforceability of a similar ordinance enacted to prevent the American Nazi Party from demonstrating in Skokie, Illinois. The Court denied certiorari, thereby preserving, presumably, the sanctity of freedom of speech. Do ugly ideas wither when aired, or is this reasoning naive? This article will examine the relationship between racial defamation and freedom of speech. It will compare American libel law with that of several countries where restrictive statutes have long been in place, and will draw conclusions as to the moral, social and practical value of laws that allow the state to punish racial defamation and permit the courts to limit that form of speech...|$|R
40|$|In 2013, the European Union (EU) {{initiated}} {{negotiations for}} regional trade agreements (RTAs) with the United States (US) and Japan, key trading partners {{and two of}} the largest economies in the world. Both countries have strong <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> in audio-visual services, a sector that is a sensitive defensive interest to the EU. In this paper, it is argued that, besides the likelihood of it being unacceptable to the US and Japan, the ‘cultural exception’ for audio-visual services as applied in EU trade policy is ill-fitting for its purposes. First, it is too narrow at a cross-sectoral level and, second, it is too wide at the sectoral level. Therefore, it is claimed that the EU should reassess its negotiation strategy vis-à-vis audio-visual services. For inspiration in doing so, this paper analyses four cases in which the US and Japan have negotiated bilaterally on audio-visual services with counterparties with defensive interests somewhat similar to the EU’s, i. e. Canada, Korea, Switzerland and India. It concludes that whilst the Canadian approach, i. e. exclusion, is unlikely to be acceptable to the EU’s negotiating partners, the Korean, Swiss and, to a lesser extent Indian, approaches provide ample guidance for the EU to rethink its negotiation strategy for audio-visual services. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{finds that}} trade in {{services}} contributes to a broader services supplier base that supports competitiveness in high-technology and high-value added manufacturing. It is shown that with low, but still significant trade costs in services, large countries have a comparative advantage for services-intensive manufactured goods, an advantage that is enhanced if the country also produces intermediate services more effectively or has lower barriers to entry for services suppliers. Countries with superior organisational technology (using producer services more effectively) will strengthen their comparative advantage in manufacturing following services trade liberalisation. The impact of services trade liberalisation on trade in manufacturing is non-linear. Until trade costs have reached a threshold level the trade response is quite modest. Consequently, going the last mile of services trade liberalisation, including lowering regulatory barriers, will have the largest impact. Exports of labour-intensive manufactures require a host of supporting services {{and the need for}} these services has increased over time due to rapidly changing consumer tastes and growing consumer awareness of health, safety and social standards. In order to support industrial development, developing countries need to focus their services trade policy not only on <b>offensive</b> <b>interests,</b> but also on ensuring that local manufacturers have the best possible access to services. Improving market access in telecommunications and business services; particularly legal services, accounting, advertising and technical consulting services would have the largest impact. general equilibrium, services trade liberalisation, linkages...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the Doha Development Agenda {{objective}} of establishing a fair and market-oriented trading system West and Central African (WCA) cotton-producing countries have submitted to the WTO a joint proposal for reform of the cotton market. The proposal calls for 'reforms to correct and prevent restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets', particularly as this affects the cotton sector. It argues that in the cotton sector OECD subsidies have pushed down prices and export earnings of WCA countries by at least US $ 250 million, to the acute detriment of their cotton growers. The signatory countries called for: recognition of the strategic nature of cotton for development and poverty reduction in many LDCs; the extension of the concept of 'special products' - currently restricted to defensive measures - to the <b>offensive</b> <b>interests</b> of developing countries, in other words, where export of such products is essential for agricultural development or the survival of the rural population in LDCs, as is the case for cotton; explicit recognition of cotton as a 'special product' for development and poverty reduction in LDCs and hence extension of special treatment to cotton; a complete phasing out of support measures for the production and export of cotton; the complete phasing out of border controls; the establishment at Cancun of a mechanism for the phasing out of support for cotton production with a view to its total elimination; the provision of financial compensation to cotton producers in LDCs to offset income losses until such times as subsidies have been removed from the cotton sector. The submission provides background on the importance of cotton production in WCA countries and notes that WCA countries are the second largest cotton exporters after the USA and one of the lowest cost producers. The submission notes how much public aid to cotton production has grown in recent years. In July 2002, the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) indicated that 73 % of global production of cotton required direct financial support from governments up from 50 % five years earlier. The USA is seen as the worst offender, providing US$ 2. 3 billion in support in 2001 / 2002, while the EU provided around US$ 700 million in the same year. For Spanish cotton producers support represents 180 % of global prices and for Greek producers 160 % of global prices, the highest level of subsidies in the world in the cotton sector. The submission argues that if American domestic subsidies were eliminated cotton prices would rise from US $ 0. 12 per pound to US $ 0. 22 per pound. If globally all subsidies were removed the price increase could reach US $ 0. 33 per pound. Comment: This situation needs to be seen against the background of the dismantling of the STABEX Facility under the Cotonou Agreement and the singular failure of the new system which was intended to replace STABEX to effectively support the income of cotton and other basic commodity (e. g. coffee) dependent ACP countries. The dismantling of the STABEX scheme based as it was on the belief that the market would best serve these countries stands {{in stark contrast to the}} domestic support extended to cotton producers in the EU. Clearly in a number of the recommendations listed in this joint submission the EU could provide an important lead.
