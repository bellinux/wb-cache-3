5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision – {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept from me a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E

500|$|In France {{the action}} was greeted with celebration, and it became the only naval battle commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe. The British {{response}} was despondent, although all four captains were subsequently cleared and praised at their courts-martial inquiring into {{the loss of their}} ships. The only criticism was of Willoughby, who was accused of giving a misleading signal in indicating that the French were of inferior force on 22 August. Contemporary historian William James described British reaction to the battle as [...] "that the noble behaviour of her officers and crew threw such a halo of glory around the defeat at Grand Port, that, in public opinion at least, the loss of four frigates was scarcely considered a misfortune." [...] However, he also notes that [...] "No case <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> aware more deeply affects the character of the Royal Navy than the defeat it sustained at Grand Port." [...] On 30 December 1899, a monument was erected at the harbour of Grand Port in the memory of the British and French sailors who were killed in the engagement.|$|E
500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not likely to see again in American history".|$|E

Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, Tiptoe was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two tugboats. The commanding officer at the time was LieutenantCommander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a court-martial where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, [...] "The ship was not worked up {{and it was a very}} green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary.

2500|$|Much of Leibniz's work {{went on to}} have a {{great impact}} on the field of psychology. Leibniz thought that there are many petites {{perceptions}}, or small perceptions of which we perceive but <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps. [...] For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the unconscious. Leibniz was a direct influence on Ernst Platner, who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewußtseyn (unconscious). Additionally, the idea of subliminal stimuli {{can be traced back to}} his theory of small perceptions. Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.|$|E

[...] Such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even towards objects.
