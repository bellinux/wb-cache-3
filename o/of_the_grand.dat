5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, Active and her flotilla {{were assigned to the}} Grand Fleet. On 1 September, a submarine was spotted inside Scapa Flow and the 2nd DF was detailed to hunt down the imaginary submarine while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet put to sea. When not escorting the capital ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet, the flotilla spent much time on anti-submarine patrol off the entrances to Scapa Flow. In mid-October, multiple reports of submarines in the Minch caused Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet, to send Active and some of her destroyers there to hunt them down, but nothing was found. After their search was concluded, they joined a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet at Lough Swilly, Ireland, on 22 October. Sometime between October 1915 and January 1916, the cruiser was relieved of her assignment with the 2nd DF and she was on detached service with the Grand Fleet in January.|$|E

With Beatty's acceptance, the American battleships, while retaining their American designation of Battleship Division Nine, officially became the Sixth Battle Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Fleet.|$|E
