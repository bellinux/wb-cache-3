5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times <b>of</b> <b>adversity,</b> they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Bana {{was invited}} to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Lucky You, a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming Munich, was {{released}} in early 2007. In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional poker player who must overcome his personal problems to win a high-stakes tournament in Las Vegas. His next film was the Australian drama Romulus, My Father (2007). The film, based on Raimond Gaita's memoir of the same name, portrays a couple and their struggle in the face <b>of</b> <b>adversity</b> to raise their son. The film was a critical success, and Bana's performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor. In 2007, he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy Kath & Kim as himself.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Studies of {{the effects}} <b>of</b> {{childhood}} <b>adversities</b> often use psychiatric diagnoses and focus on physical or sexual abuse. This study explored relationships between a broader range <b>of</b> <b>adversities</b> and both diagnoses and specific symptoms. Methods: The files of 217 child and adolescent mental health service users were audited. Information regarding 14 adverse childhood experiences, 20 diagnoses and 38 symptoms was analysed. Results: Only two diagnoses (Psychosis and Oppositional Defiant Disorder) were predicted by mean number <b>of</b> <b>adversities.</b> However, the symptom clusters indicative of six diagnoses were related {{to one or more}} childhood adversities. Strong specific relationships were found between sexual abuse and hyperarousal, parental substance abuse and rule violation, and loss and avoidance/numbing. Mean number <b>of</b> <b>adversities</b> predicted six specific symptoms as well as global functioning, risk to self, and risk to others. Parental mental health, a proxy for genetic influence, was unrelated to all diagnoses, all symptom clusters and {{all but one of the}} 38 symptoms. Conclusions: Understanding the complex nature {{of the effects}} <b>of</b> childhood <b>adversities</b> are constrained by focusing on diagnoses and a restricted range <b>of</b> <b>adversities.</b> The need to take a full psychosocial history in child and adolescent mental health services, and the implications for primary prevention, are discussed...|$|R

All participants experienced two or more adversities and experienced greater overall adversity than youth in population-based studies. Youth-proposed stressors were among the most prevalent, and females, older youth, and African American youth reported disproportionately greater number <b>of</b> <b>adversities.</b> Specific types <b>of</b> <b>adversities</b> were endorsed differentially based on gender and race/ethnicity.

25|$|Saṅkaṭa (Hindi: सङ्कट, meaning Adversity): The poet {{introduces}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>adversity,</b> {{which is a}} test for friendship, skill, intellect, and virtues. Aṣṭāvakra's body becomes {{like that of the}} egg of a turtle. Kahola starts repenting for his action of cursing the child. The sin of the Ṛṣi manifests as a drought in the forest, and all the disciples of Kahola leave the Āśrama. The birds and animals in the forest start dying out of hunger and thirst. Sujātā asks Kahola to go to the Yajña of Janaka and get some wealth by defeating the assembly of the wise in a scriptural debate. Kahola goes to Mithilā against his wishes, and is beaten in the debate by Bandī, the son of Varuṇa, who then immerses Kahola under water in the Varuṇapāśa. In the forest, Sujātā gives birth to a boy. Uddālaka comes to the aid of Sujātā and tells her about the fate of Kahola, asking her to keep this secret from her child, as the knowledge of his father's defeat will be a hurdle in the growth of the child. Uddālaka performs the Jātakarman Saṃskāra of the infant. The child is called Aṣṭavakra (having eight limbs deformed) by everybody, but Uddālaka names him Aṣṭāvakra, with the meanings as explained here. The canto ends with Aṣṭāvakra starting to grow in the Āśrama of his maternal grandfather.|$|E

40|$|Research studies {{investigating}} the impact <b>of</b> childhood cumulative <b>adversity</b> on adult mental health have proliferated in recent years. In general, {{little attention has}} been paid to the operationalization <b>of</b> cumulative <b>adversity,</b> with most studies operationalizing this as the simple sum of the number of occurrences of distinct events experienced. In addition, the possibility that the mathematical relationship <b>of</b> cumulative childhood <b>adversity</b> to some mental health dimensions may be more complex than a basic linear association has not often been considered. This study explores these issues with 2 waves of data drawn from an economically and racially diverse sample transitioning to adulthood in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. A diverse set <b>of</b> childhood <b>adversities</b> were reported in high school and 3 mental health outcomes [...] depressed mood, drug use, and antisocial behavior [...] were reported 2 years later during the transition to adulthood. Our results suggest that both operationalization and statistical modeling are important and interrelated and, as such, they have the potential to influence substantive interpretation of the effect <b>of</b> cumulative childhood <b>adversity</b> on adult mental health. In our data, total cumulative childhood adversity was related to depressive symptoms, drug use, and antisocial behavior in a positive curvilinear manner with incremental impact increasing as adversities accumulate, but further analysis revealed that this curvilinear effect was an artifact of the confounding <b>of</b> high cumulative <b>adversity</b> scores with the experience of more severe events. Thus, respondents with higher cumulative adversity had disproportionately poorer mental health because of the severity <b>of</b> the <b>adversities</b> they were exposed to, not the cumulative number of different types <b>of</b> <b>adversities</b> experienced. These results indicate that public health efforts targeting prevention <b>of</b> childhood <b>adversities</b> would best be aimed at the most severe adversities in order to have greatest benefit to mental health in young adulthood.

40|$|Background: Although {{several studies}} have shown that life adversities play an {{important}} role in the etiology and maintenance of both depressive and anxiety disorders, little is known about the relative specificity of several types <b>of</b> life <b>adversities</b> to different forms of depressive and anxiety disorder and the concurrent role of neuroticism. Few studies have investigated whether clustering <b>of</b> life <b>adversities</b> or comorbidity <b>of</b> psychiatric disorders critically influence these relationships. Methods: Using data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), we analyzed the association <b>of</b> childhood <b>adversities</b> and negative life experiences across the lifespan with lifetime DSM-IV-based diagnoses of depression or anxiety among 2288 participants with at least one affective disorder. Results: Controlling for comorbidity and clustering <b>of</b> <b>adversities</b> the association <b>of</b> childhood <b>adversity</b> with affective disorders was greater than that of negative life events across the life span with affective disorders. Among childhood adversities, emotional neglect was specifically associated with depressive disorder, dysthymia, and social phobia. Persons with a history of emotional neglect and sexual abuse were more likely to develop more than one lifetime affective disorder. Neuroticism and current affective disorder did not affect the adversity-disorder relationships found. Limitations: Using a retrospective study design, causal interpretations of the relationships found are not warranted. Conclusions: Emotional neglect seems to be differentially related to depression, dysthymia and social phobia. This knowledge may help to reduce underestimation of the impact of emotional abuse and lead to better recognition and treatment to prevent long-term disorders. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
