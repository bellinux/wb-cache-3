5|$|A {{final phase}} of expansion, that {{received}} planning approval {{at the same time}} as the others but which remains unscheduled, will add a matching third tier of seats to the North Stand. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> last phase is completed it will bring the stadium's total seating capacity up to approximately 61,000, making the Etihad Stadium the nation's second largest capacity club ground.|$|E
5|$|After fortifying Belbina, Cleomenes {{advanced}} into Arcadia with 3,000 {{infantry and}} a few cavalry. However, he was called back by the ephors, and this retreat allowed Aratus to seize Caphyae as soon as Cleomenes returned to Laconia. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> news reached Sparta, the ephors sent Cleomenes out again; he managed to capture the Megalopian city Methydrium before ravaging the territory surrounding Argos.|$|E

5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the symptoms, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The game {{also offers}} {{objectives}} {{to be accomplished}} over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing three or more rows at <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> unlocks power-ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino drops, and removing blocks from the screen. Up to three power-ups can be selected {{to be used in}} each game.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} musical innovation of the concerto delle donne was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, {{from one}} voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment {{to two or}} three voices singing varying diminutions at <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> practice, which listeners found remarkable, was imitated by many composers, including Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi.|$|E
5|$|After being anointed, {{the monarch}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool {{placed in front of}} it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; <b>once</b> <b>this</b> reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the meeting, {{confidential}} negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, Bessarabia in Europe and Batum and Kars {{on the east coast}} of the Black Sea. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of Cyprus. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{arrived in}} Sydney with the {{survivors}} on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, {{was moved to}} Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> was completed, Melbourne was removed while the new bow {{was put in place}} in the drydock; Melbourne was then returned to the drydock where her new bow was fitted. The work was eventually completed on 27 April, with the shipyard receiving a commendation.|$|E

5|$|On 22 September the German battle {{group in}} Norway was {{attacked}} by several British midget submarines. This raid inflicted significant damage on Tirpitz, leaving the battleship unable to proceed to sea until repairs were complete. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> was known to the Allies, {{the commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Bruce Fraser, judged that the changed balance of forces would allow his force to assume a more offensive role by attacking German shipping off Norway and restarting the Arctic Convoys to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June, Prpić {{launched}} a three-pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar–Nevesinje road by a force close to two battalions, Francetić led his unit of Ustaše north from Berkovići through the mountains via Odžak to approach Nevesinje from the south, and two companies of the 11th Battalion thrust southwest along the road from Plužine. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> task was complete, the NDH forces were to vigorously pursue the rebels and destroy them.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> was done, they began modifying it.|$|E

5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). <b>Once</b> <b>this</b> decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, <b>once</b> <b>this</b> was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is split}} into 20 sub-parts each given a title in English written mostly in white where {{a portion of}} the title is {{displayed}} in red, and each covers a single day.

In the original game, a bonus role-playing game became available on the title screen after the game was completed at least <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> was later removed from the full-voice DVD edition of the game.
