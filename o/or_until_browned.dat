50|$|Another variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is {{made from}} yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). The dough is rolled with a {{conventional}} rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F <b>or</b> 205 °C) <b>until</b> <b>browned,</b> and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.|$|R

50|$|The coconut (kelapa) {{is another}} quintessential feature of Malaysian cuisine, and {{virtually}} {{all parts of the}} plant are used for culinary purposes.

Coconut water, the clear liquid found inside the cavity of each coconut, is a popular cooler in Malaysia's hot and humid climate. Gula melaka is unrefined palm sugar produced from the sap of the coconut flower. It is the most traditional sweetener in Malaysian cooking and imbues a rich caramel-like flavour with a hint of coconut. Coconut fronds are traditionally used to wrap food, hollowed out coconut husks and shells may be used as a source of charcoal fuel for barbecued meats and traditional pastry making, and even the apical bud or growing tip of the coconut palm is a popular delicacy served in rural communities and specialist restaurants.|$|R
