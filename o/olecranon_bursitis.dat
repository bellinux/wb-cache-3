5000|$|<b>Olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> (also informally {{known as}} [...] "Liquid Elbow [...] ", [...] "elbow bump", [...] "student's elbow", [...] "Popeye elbow", or [...] "baker's elbow"), is a {{condition}} characterized by pain, redness and swelling around the elbow, caused by inflammation of the fluid filled sac of the elbow joint. This bursa is located just over the extensor aspect of the extreme proximal end of the ulna. In common with other bursae, it is impalpable and contains {{only a very small}} amount of fluid in its normal state, and fulfills the function of facilitating the joint's movement by enabling anatomical structures to glide more easily over each other.|$|E
40|$|Objectives No {{evidence-based}} recommendations {{exist for}} the management of infectious bursitis. We examined epidemiology and risk factors for recurrence of septic bursitis. Specifically, we compared outcome in patients receiving bursectomy plus short-course adjuvant antibiotic therapy (≤ 7 days) with that of patients receiving bursectomy plus longer-course antibiotic therapy (> 7 days). Patients and methods Retrospective study of adult patients with infectious <b>olecranon</b> and patellar <b>bursitis</b> requiring hospitalization at Geneva University Hospital from January 1996 to March 2009. Results We identified 343 episodes of infectious <b>bursitis</b> (237 <b>olecranon</b> and 106 patellar). Staphylococcus aureus predominated among the 256 cases with an identifiable pathogen (85 %). Three hundred and twelve cases (91 %) were treated surgically; 142 (41 %) with one-stage bursectomy and closure and 146 with two-stage bursectomy. All received antibiotics for a median duration of 13 days with a median intravenous component of 3 days. Cure was achieved in 293 (85 %) episodes. Total duration of antibiotic therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0. 9; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 8 - 1. 1] showed no association with cure. In multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression was linked to recurrence (OR 5. 6; 95 % CI 1. 9 - 18. 4). Compared with ≤ 7 days, 8 - 14 days of antibiotic treatment (OR 0. 6; 95 % CI 0. 1 - 2. 9) or > 14 days of antibiotic treatment (OR 0. 9; 95 % CI 0. 1 - 10. 7) was equivalent, as was the intravenous component (OR 1. 1; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 3). Conclusions In severe infectious bursitis requiring hospitalization, adjuvant antibiotic therapy might be limited to 7 days in non-immunosuppressed patient...|$|R
40|$|<b>Olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> is {{relatively}} common. One third of episodes are septic. Most {{of the remainder}} are non-septic, with occasional rheumatological causes. Trauma can cause both septic and non-septic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis.</b> Clinical features are helpful in separating septic from non-septic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis,</b> {{but there may be}} local erythema in both. Aspiration should be carried out in all cases, and if the presence of infection is still in doubt, microscopy, Gram staining, and culture of the aspirate will resolve the issue. Septic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> should be treated by aspiration, which may need to be repeated, and a long course of antibiotics. Some cases will need admission, and a few will need surgical treatment. Non-septic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> can be managed with aspiration alone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs probably hasten symptomatic improvement. Intrabursal corticosteroids produce a rapid resolution but concern remains over their long term local effects.

Aim of the workThe aim of the current case reports is to describe the clinical and the magnetic resonance imaging features of acute gouty <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> as initial presentation of acute gouty attack. Case reportIn this report we describe the clinical and MRI features of three cases presenting with acute gouty <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis,</b> in spite of normal serum uric acid and stable renal function. For all cases diagnostic aspiration was carried out to exclude septic bursitis as initial first step of management. The bursal fluid was also examined under Polarized microscopy and monosodium urate crystals were identified in the aspirated fluid with typical negative birefringence typical for urate crystals. The literature on MRI features of <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> as atypical presentation of gout is reviewed. ConclusionOlcernaon gouty bursitis can be the initial presentation of acute gouty attack and {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis in acute presentation after exclusion of sepsis.

Due to persistent bursal swelling, she underwent three separate therapeutic bursal aspirations, two involving intrabursal steroid injection. After the third aspiration, the bursa became erythematous and severely swollen, and bursal fluid grew Mycobacterium avium complex. Triple-drug antimycobacterial therapy was initiated, but discontinued abruptly due to a rash. Surgery was not performed.

40|$|Introduction: Septic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> due to {{atypical}} mycobacteria is rare. An insidious beginning can delay diagnosis and treatment. Antibacterial therapy recommendations are not well-defined for bursitis caused by {{atypical mycobacteria}}. We present a rare case of <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> caused by Mycobacterium gordonae, reporting our experiences regarding pathogen identification and antibiotic therapy, which differs from regimes used in common septic bursitis mostly caused by staphylococcus aureus. 				 					Methods: A 35 -year-old male with bursitis olecrani received open bursectomy. Microbiological culture {{did not reveal}} bacteria. Due to wound healing complications revision surgery was performed four weeks postoperatively. Finally, Mycobacterium gordonae was identified by PCR and an antibiogram could be developed. A triple antimicrobial combination therapy with Rifampicin, Clarithromycin, and Ethambutol was administered systemically for 12 months. The patient was followed-up for 24 months. 				 					Results: After the second operation with pathogen identification and antibiotic combination therapy the wound healed without any additional complications. At last follow-up 24 months after the first surgery with bursectomy and 23 months after revision surgery with debridement, the patient was still pain free with no significant clinical findings or tenderness to touch at the operation site. Elbow range of motion was full. 				 					Discussion: As septic bursitis {{can be caused by}} many different and sometimes rare and difficult to identify bacteria, intraoperative probes should be taken and histopathological and microbiological analysis should be conducted, including PCR.

40|$|Abstract Background Extremity lipomas {{may occur}} in any location, {{including}} the proximal forearm. We describe {{a case of}} a patient with an intramuscular lipoma presenting as an unusual posterior elbow mass. Case presentation We discuss the case of a 57 -year-old Caucasian man who presented with a tender, posterior elbow mass initially diagnosed as chronic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis.</b> A minor sensory disturbance in the distribution of the superficial radial nerve was initially thought to be unrelated, but was likely caused by mass effect from the lipoma. No pre-operative advanced imaging was obtained because the diagnosis was felt to have already been made. At the time of surgery, a fatty mass originating in the volar forearm muscles was found to have breached the dorsal forearm fascia and displaced the olecranon bursa. Tissue diagnosis was made by histopathology as a myxoid lipoma with no aggressive features. Post-operative recovery was uneventful. Conclusion We present {{a case of a}}n unusual elbow mass presenting with symptoms consistent with chronic <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis,</b> a relatively common condition. The only unexplained pre-operative finding was the non-specific finding of a transient superficial radial nerve deficit.

The disease can present with sacroiliitis, peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, paraspinal abscess, bursitis, and osteomyelitis. A 25 -year-old male patient was admitted with fever of 20 -day duration, right-sided hip pain, and night sweating. A Brucella standard tube agglutination test was positive at a titer of 1 / 160. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip joint showed right sacroiliitis and a hyperintense, nodular, lobulated mass within the right iliacus muscle, consistent with abscess. The patient was started on intramuscular streptomycin at a dose of 1 g/day, oral rifampin 600 mg/day, and doxycycline 200 mg/day. On day 20 of treatment, the patient was admitted with swelling and pain over the left elbow for the past week.

Review of the literatureregarding this unusual infectionreveals seven reported casesof protothecalolecranonbursitis. Fivecasesfrom whichsufficientinformation was provided were diagnosed byhistologic examination of excised bursa that showed the char-acteristic sporangia. Protothecosis is a rare human infection caused by a species of the genus Prototheca. While these algae-like microorganisms lack chlorophyll, {{they do have a}} life cycle {{similar to that of the}} green algae of the genus Ch/orella [1]. Prototheca produce characteris-tic sporangia that undergo internal cleavage to form two to 20 endospores [1, 2]. Only two species, Pro-totheca wickerhamii and Prototheca zopfi, are known to cause human infection [2]. Protothecosis generally occurs in one of two forms: cutaneous in-fection [2 - 8] or <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> [9 - 12]. Also, two postoperative wound infections [9, 13] and one dis-seminated infection have been reported.

40|$|Thirty seven {{cases of}} {{bursitis}} presented to our Veterinary Teaching Hospital from 2001 to 2005. There were 10 adult female buffalos with <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> (one had bilateral bursitis) and 26 calves (7 cattle and 19 buffalos, 16 males and 10 females) with presternal bursitis. There were 10 out of 11 cases of <b>olecranon</b> <b>bursitis</b> and 21 out of 26 cases of presternal bursitis with different forms (cystic, proliferative and fibrous) that were removed surgically. The remaining 6 cases, cystic bursitis (olecranon = 1, presternal = 5), were treated by aspiration of their contents and injection of 4 % iodine tincture intrabursally. Only 2 cases recovered, 3 cases progressed to fibrosis and required further surgical treatment 2 to 3 weeks later, and 1 case {{continued to have}} a cystic lesion. Histopathological examination of tissue specimens from different forms of bursitis revealed that the acquired bursae were generally lined with synovial-like membrane formed from 2 - 3 cellular layers that covered the connective tissue capsule. The connective tissue capsule differed from one type to another and consisted of fibrous tissues containing numerous small blood vessels, blood capillaries, lymphatics and nerves. There was also evidence for inflammation within the capsule represented by congestion of blood vessels {{and the presence of}} perivascular inflammatory cells, mostly mononuclear. In conclusion, surgical treatment was successful and effective for treatment of olecranon and presternal bursitis particularly for the chronic proliferative and fibrous form in cattle and buffalo. The histological structure of the acquired bursae was relatively similar consisting of a synovial-like membrane and a connective tissue capsule with varying degrees of the inflammatory process...|$|E
