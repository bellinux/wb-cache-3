40|$|This work investigates {{quality of}} water used in boilers of Refinery Company in Nigeria. The results {{shows that the}} quality of water fed to boilers are <b>off</b> <b>specification.</b> Low water quality used in boilers led to {{frequent}} failure of the boilers as a result of tube rupture. This has resulted into low capacity utilization and loss of processing fees. The poor performance of the boiler feed treatment plant is attributable to the deplorable condition of water intake plant, raw water treatment, demineralization plant, change in raw water quality and non-functioning of the polisher unit...|$|R

40|$|The first {{generation}} of remote power controllers (RPC) developed included: a 5 -ampere design (Type 1), capable of limiting maximum overload current to 15 amperes for. 1 sec; and 5 -ampere noncurrent (Type 2) and 30 -ampere noncurrent (Type 3) limiting designs, both with selectable instant trip levels for high-current overload. Each design provides overcurrent protection through an inverse I squared T trip-out function with an automatic reset option and demonstrates step-applied fault capability with a 4000 -ampere surge, fast-risetime (low-inductance) power source. They also meet MIL - STD - 461 A specification for electromagnetic interference. The second generation RPCs traded <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> compliance for reduction in cost and complexity for the Type 1 and 2 designs and give comparable or improved performance in most areas. The noncurrent limiting RPC {{proved to be a}} more economical and feasible method of overload protection for certain load types...|$|R
40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{development of}} sol/gel ceramic fibres requires rapid objective means of assessing the mechanical and thermal properties {{of a product}} at the earliest stages of preparation. The merits of a simple tumbling test, leading to a fibre friability index, and the Bend Stress Relaxation test, which gives a high temperature creep rating, are demonstrated on commercial Saffil and Safimax alumina fibres and a development Saffil zirconia fibre, each in staple blanket form. Measurements on Alter continuous alumina/silica fibre and Nicalon are also presented. Standard and <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> alumina fibres are readily distinguished by their friability indices which correlate with the fibre strain to break. Saffil and Safimax a lumina a re com parable to Nicalon in terms of creep and superior to Alter. Saffil zircon ia approaches alumina creep performance after post fi ri ng to 1250 degrees C.

30|$|After 40 {{iterations}} of the algorithm, {{the final}} regression model contains 22 variables. As anticipated by RAAL technicians, final product quality is strongly {{dependent on the}} crystal size distribution. Thus, the majority of variables in the model are for the percentage of particles above and below certain size limits at various stages of the manufacturing process. In particular, final quality is inversely proportional to the percentage of particles above and below certain in-house quality threshold values. Thus, if the model predicts that quality will be <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> five days into the future, RAAL can adjust conditions in precipitation accordingly. In addition to particle size, the variable to indicate significant system events was also included in the model. As expected, there was a strong positive correlation between final quality and the system event parameter. RAAL have less control over this variable. In the case of a plant shutdown, RAAL can modify their process to respond to the changes resulting from the shutdown. However, they have less control of the system for unforeseen events such as an equipment malfunction.|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Namakwa Sands {{is a heavy}} mineral {{mining and}} {{beneficiation}} business within Tronox, and produces two major products, zircon (zr 02. Si 02 99. 9 %) and rutile (Ti 02 99. 9 %) at a combined annual rate of 140 kt. The heavy mineral concentrates are exported to international markets to make specialist coatings for the paints and ceramics industries. The ceramic industry is very strict on {{the purity of the}} minerals used. Namakwa Sands prides itself in being able to produce zircon and rutile at these requirements; however, strict requirements, especially in terms of Fe impurities (Fe 203 content in zircon concentrate must be < 600 ppm), limit the productivity and come at a cost to recovery. The concentration and separation of heavy minerals is a complex process, which utilizes conductivity differences between minerals. Zircon coated with iron oxides (Fe 203, FeOOH) reports as more conductive during electrostatic separation, which can result in a zircon particle to behave like a rutile particle and in this way cause both products (rutile and zircon) to become <b>off</b> <b>specification...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} amount of {{purchased}} fuels, more and more plants are making use of in-plant generated sources of gases. The availability of such waste gases is usually not constant, thus the total plant's mixed gas heating value swings accordingly. When this mixed gas is fed to the furnaces or boilers that are on strictly volumetric flow control loops, it causes large upsets in the heat release rate, even at a constant flow. These upsets, in turn, cause changes in process temperatures and/or pressures, resulting in <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> products and air pollution violations, and may even cause damage to equipment. The tendency is to operate routinely at a high excess air level, resulting in a much lower overall efficiency, or to even flare the gas. For many fuel gases, the heating value per standard unit volume varies linearly with the mass per standard unit volume. Perhaps a lesser realized fact it that the air required for combustion of 1000 Btu (net) heat release is almost independent of fuel molecular weight. This paper will describe the details of a technique developed by the Foxboro Company to measure the incoming fuel gas total Btu content by using a differential pressure transmitter and vortex flowmeter in series, generate a feed forward signal to maximize overall efficiency through transients, and to do it without compromising any of the safety constraints of the furnace...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} in architectural research involving sensors is detecting errors within raw data and separating these errors from the reliable and relevant data. This research on the Interlock House aims to develop an alert system to notify when the house is operating below efficiency and for identifying abnormal data caused by sensor errors/failures. Additionally, the system would assist in controlling environmental settings. There are three parameters for operating this alert system. The first parameter, used to signify if a sensor is malfunctioning, includes the range for each sensor’s capabilities based <b>off</b> technical <b>specifications.</b> The second parameter, derived from historical data, signifies data that does not have historical precedence (ex. record breaking temperatures). The third parameter, depending on what the specific sensor is measuring, focuses on either the range of human comfort or equipment specifications, using the maximum and minimum again, to control environmental settings and identify when a mechanical component is malfunctioning. Together, the historical data and equipment standards aid in identifying when the house is operating below efficiency. The ideal results of this research would improve the energy efficiency of the Interlock House and thereby provide a model for improving the efficiency of other buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} Local {{critique}} plot {{is illustrated}} by three different applications. The applications involve directed acyclic graph (DAG) models of varying complexity and structure, and they illustrate different aspects and abilities of the plots. We see examples where the posterior is a trade <b>off</b> of tail <b>specifications</b> because of conflict between the local prior and the lifted likelihood. Hence model choices made on these tails are, perhaps unexpectedly, identified as influential. We also see how the local critique plot can reveal local prior or lifted likelihood domination. The applications also illustrate that diagnostic warnings from the local critique plot prompt us to reconsider the statistical model, but that sometimes a reexamination can assure us that the choices are justified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A Statement of the Colombian Constitutional Court has {{mandated}} {{wage indexation}} {{on the basis}} of past inflation. A simple model with a wage price system, a real block, and an inflation targeting interest rule is calibrated to resemble price setting in the Colombian economy and to analyze the differing slope of the output inflation trade <b>off</b> for different <b>specifications</b> of wage indexation. The disinflation experiments show that backward looking indexation increases inflation inertia, decreases the effect of monetary policy, and increases the cost of disinflation. Shorter wage contracts and more frequent wage negotiations do not appear to have important effects on the cost of disinflation. Higher central bank credibility and the use of forward looking inflation expectations in wage negotiations decrease the cost of disinflation and may eventually lead to a boom. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} comparison of three synchronous clock, acoustic, distributed navigation algorithms {{commonly found in}} the underwater robotics community and literature: a naively distributed extended Kalman filter (NEKF), the interleaved update (IU) algorithm, and a decentralized extended information filter (DEIF). Traditional deadreckoned underwater navigation methods result in unbounded error growth as subsea vehicles do not typically have access to an absolute position reference. Synchronous-clock acoustic navigation systems can provide one-way travel time (OWTT) range constraints to nearby vehicle nodes thereby bounding error. Several distributed estimation algorithms for such scenarios have been proposed by the community; however, each makes fundamentally different trade <b>offs</b> in various <b>specifications</b> such as scalability, complexity, directionality, and consistency. We report an experimental comparison between the performance of each algorithm {{as compared to the}} benchmark solution of a centralized extended Kalman filter (CEKF) applied to a variety of 2 -node and 3 -node vehicle network topologies using data collected from two Ocean-Server autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and a surface craft.

Prior to beginning the design, certain specifications need to be validated to make sure the intended LNA will even work accordingly, such as stability factor and approximate error. The bulk of the calculation will consist of designing matching networks via Smith Charts followed by validation using computer-aided simulation...|$|R
50|$|The DN-1 {{was roughly}} {{based on the}} German Parseval type of non-rigid airship. The {{envelope}} was made of two layers of cloth, with rubber between them. The outer layer of fabric was yellow to prevent deterioration caused by light. The gondola control car, built by George Lawley & Son of Dorchester, Massachusetts, was a large rectangular box with two four-bladed propellers on outriggers. There were originally two engines, built by the B. F. Sturtevant Company of Hyde Park, MA, were mounted in the open gondola, and the propellers could be swiveled to provide thrust in either the horizontal or vertical planes. A 1-1/2 hp Indian engine was provided to maintain air pressure in the two ballonets when the engine was not running. The gondola was water-tight as the Navy intended to operate the DN-1 <b>off</b> water. The <b>specification</b> for the DN-1 provided for being capable of being moored to a mooring mast which had first been used with HMA No. 1 in 1911. The DN-1 was photographed beside a mooring mast but {{there appears to be}} no evidence it was ever moored to it.|$|R
5000|$|The Arethusas were {{a smaller}} {{version of the}} Amphion group of the earlier , having the unit {{machinery}} layout and two funnels of the former. The design was judged to be the minimum required for a [...] "trade route cruiser" [...] {{to counter the threat}} of the auxiliary cruiser over which, even with their reduced armament, they would enjoy a comfortable superiority. They were also to be capable of acting as a fleet cruiser (which was fortunate because, in the end, they were used almost exclusively with the fleet). Therefore, no reduction in speed (i.e. machinery) could be accepted and savings had to be found in armament, size and protection; the Arethusas suppressed 'X' 6-inch gun turret and were 50 ft shorter and displaced 1,250 tons less than the Leanders. The protection scheme was the same as the Leanders but was generally thinner to save weight. This allowed six Arethusas to be built for every five Leanders within the constraints of tonnage allowed under treaties then in force. Welded construction was widely used {{for the first time to}} save weight, over 250 tons being cut <b>off</b> the original <b>specification.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{that the combination of}} several factors, such as the electrical and mechanical stimulation, coupled with biochemical conditioning, is the most promising approach for in vitro development of fully functional engineered tissue-like structures having concrete chances of success when implanted in vivo for the repair of the impaired myocardium. In this scenario, the design of advanced technological platforms, i. e., bioreactors, represents a key element to define standardized, automated and repeatable bioprocessing steps replicating in vitro the physicochemical and mechanical cues triggering maturation of engineered cardiac tissues. We describe our technological advances in developing macro- and micro-scale bioreactors aimed at providing single or combined mechanical/electrical stimulation either to cultured cells or tissue constructs. Additional design requirements are: i) trading <b>off</b> the technical <b>specifications</b> with the needs of the final user’s environment, i. e. the biological lab; ii) the straightforward operability and the compliance with good laboratory practice; iii) a smart use of the concept of modularity, i. e. allowing simultaneous multiple cultures with independent stimulation patterns, which speeds up the experimental campaigns. The developed devices allow for a fine tuning of cellular electrical/mechanical stimulations, representing ideal tools for standardized and high-throughput analyses in cell biology and cardiac regenerative medicine...|$|R

40|$|Micro- and nano-manufacturing is an {{expanding}} industry and many different manufacturing techniques are used, from advanced {{focused ion beam}} treatment to reasonably simple printing technologies. Common {{to all of them}} are the needs to verify the manufactured geometries and dimensions. This report presents the results of the second round of benchmarking activities within the EUMINAfab European Research Infrastructure, in order to establish more knowledge about the capabilities of a screen printing installation. To obtain {{a better understanding of the}} accuracy of the screen printing installation, a precise verification test is needed to measure the absolute performance of the machine. Predicted performance and capability information is based on specifications given for the machine installation by the machine deliverer. But, in practice the absolute performances of the installation is often <b>off</b> from the <b>specification.</b> When forming the EUMINAfab infrastructure consortium it was decided that independent high precision verification tests should be made on different installations to help the micro-manufacturers to get the real capability information of their equipment and be able to improve performance to a higher EUMINAfab level. In this study a comprehensive verification test was designed and carried out by using an ultra-precision metrology method in order to establish more knowledge about the capabilities of the screen printing equipment. The measurement results show the machine’s X,Y position accuracy, pseudo-repeatability and reproducibility. It is not as good as predicted. QC 20170523 </p...|$|R
