5|$|At Wimbledon, Del Potro won against Albert Ramos, Jesse Levine, and Grega Å½emlja before {{advancing}} {{past the}} fourth round {{for the first}} time in his career, thanks to a win over Andreas Seppi. He then played David Ferrer and, despite slipping badly during the fifth point of the match and aggravating a pre-existing leg injury, requiring over five minutes <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> by his own admission being close to forfeiting the match, he recovered to defeat Ferrer in straight sets to advance to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2009 US Open without dropping a set. On 5 July, Djokovic defeated him in five sets in 4 hours and 43 minutes, making it the longest semifinal in the history of Wimbledon men's singles.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{examined}} gender {{similarities and}} differences in the predictors <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry <b>and</b> the combination <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry <b>and</b> completion. Methods: The sample consisted of 2, 219 male and female program participants.

Results: There were gender {{similarities and differences}} in predictors <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry <b>and</b> the combination <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry <b>and</b> completion. Many of the factors which attract individuals to treatment are the same which keep individuals in treatment. Conclusions: The greatest consistency in results when making gender comparisons and when comparing predictors <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry to predictors <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry <b>and</b> completion was for attitudinal predictors, namely motivation to change...|$|R

5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>and</b> may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and {{has been shown to}} be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> may last from two to four months.|$|E

40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are assigned to}} influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables <b>of</b> the earlier <b>treatments</b> <b>and</b> confounders <b>of</b> the subsequent <b>treatments.</b> In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference of the causal effect <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all <b>treatments</b> <b>and</b> time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> (2) express patterns of net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by constraints on point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> <b>and</b> (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments.</b> Accordingly we (1) estimate net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> through point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by maximum likelihood, (2) improve the estimation by constraints on point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>and</b> assignment conditions <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> <b>and</b> (3) use the estimates of net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> to obtain those of sequential causal effects. As a result, we obtain unbiased consistent maximum-likelihood estimates of sequential causal effects even for long treatment sequences. For illustration of our method, we study the causal effects of various sequences of recreational drugs on the CD 4 count among HIV patients. Comment: 33 pages, 3 table...|$|R

5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>and</b> the fact that the gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed {{to play a role in}} DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
