This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat.

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before {{passing through the}} infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit {{in the air and}} caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{detained}} in Syria's Mezzeh Prison when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer, Yusef Urabi, was killed. Urabi had been chairing {{a meeting to}} ease tensions between Arafat and Palestinian Liberation Front leader Ahmed Jibril, but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended, delegating representatives to attend on their behalf. Urabi was killed during <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> meeting amid disputed circumstances. On the orders of Defense Minister Hafez al-Assad, {{a close friend of}} Urabi, Arafat was subsequently arrested, found guilty by a three-man jury and sentenced to death. However, he and his colleagues were pardoned by President Salah Jadid shortly after the verdict. The incident brought Assad and Arafat to unpleasant terms, which would surface later when Assad became President of Syria.|$|E

North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel.

In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E

5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that common hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion during <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Pleistocene, attributed {{to an increase in}} water bodies {{at the end of the}} era. These findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. Hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. In May 2006, the hippopotamus was identified as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7% and 20% since the IUCN's 1996 study. Zambia (40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) possess the largest populations.|$|E
5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E

5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in <b>or</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E

These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded.

Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E
