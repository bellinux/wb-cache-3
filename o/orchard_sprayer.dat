40|$|Pesticide spray {{flow from}} air-assisted <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> through pear orchard and {{deposition}} on different environmental systems were estimated {{using a new}} integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The model simulated the complex interactions between wind, air and spray flow from the sprayer with target orchard canopy and the neighbouring environment. The new CFD approach involves the incorporation of the actual 3 D canopy architecture into the model to simulate its effect on air and spray flow and deposition of droplets on the branches. Source-sink terms {{were added to the}} basic momentum and turbulence equations in a detailed sub-domain created around the branches to represent the effect of leaves. The spray droplets were generated from atomization model and tracked using a Lagrangian particle transport model. A new stochastic deposition model was developed and used to calculate deposition on leaves. The deposition model is a function of leaf optical porosity of the trees, leaf area density, leaf drag coefficient and droplet interception coefficient of the leaves. Two distinct nozzle setups, orchard and boom sprayer setups with AIR brown and TT blue nozzles, respectively, were compared to assess the effect of droplet size distribution on spray flow and deposition. The model results were compared with results from field measurements. For both sprayer setups, the simulation results agreed well with the measurements. The spray proportion above the tree height and behind the trees for the boom sprayer setup was 57. 2 % and 69. 6 % more than the <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> setup according to the simulations and the measurements, respectively. Such a model can be used to improve design features and the calibration of operational parameters of sprayers for better spraying efficiency and reduced environmental impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to demonstrate}} the basic system elements of a prototype automated <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer,</b> which can deliver pesticide spray selectively withrespect to {{the characteristics of the}} targets. The contour of the apple tree canopy was detected by ultra sound sensors Prowave 400 EP 14 D and appropriate electronics. Ultra sound signal was processed by a personal computer and fed in real-time to spraying nozzles which open and close in relation to the canopy structure. The current project focuses on developing the system components for spraying an individual tree. The evaluation was performed in field experiments by detecting deposits on leaves and water sensitive papers (WSP).

The experiments were carried out for both speeds of the gear box. Experimental tests have shown that airflow speed changes along the tower of the fan depending on the distance and position. The direction of rotation of the fan in a clockwise direction, influences the airflow speed, being higher on the right side. When measuring vertical airflow velocity (3 and 4 m distance between rows), there can be observed a slowing of the airflow speed along with height, maximum speed being at ground level. Also here can be observed that the speed of airflow in the right side is higher on all points measured...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} get an equation of the decrease of air velocity crossing the canopy of tree crops during pesticide application using air carrier <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers.</b> The utility of such a model rises from {{the need for an}} aid to understand the experimental results of several authors, who agree with the opinion that air jet velocity greatly affects environmental pollution from pesticides. Further, probably in the future it will arise the demand to implement the equation of air velocity decay in self-adjustment systems of the fan installed on <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> to limit spray drift. Based on momentum theorem applied under three assumptions, a differential equation was found and its integration lead to a closed solution that can easily be implemented in a PLC for the self-adjustment system to develop. The integral equation thus obtained, together with the assumptions made, was submitted to on-field verification on three crops (peach, vine and apple).

40|$|Air {{assisted}} <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> {{are characterized}} by a strong airflow that carries the pesticide droplets to the target canopy and assist in moving the plant parts to allow deposition throughout the whole tree. It has been shown before that different designs of <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> result in different airflow profiles, {{but it is still}} unclear whether these differences strongly affect on-target spray distribution, and {{what is the role of}} tree architecture. Here we present an in-field analysis of the on-target deposition profiles from three distinct sprayer types in trees of four different apple and pear training systems. The results obtained showed that there was a strong relationship between the vertical leaf deposition profile and the outlet air flow pattern from the sprayers. Stronger air assistance (higher air speed) was directly correlated to a higher on-target deposition. It was also observed that directing nozzles towards the target is always an advantage irrespective of tree architecture. Tree characteristics such as total leaf cover, leaf wall porosity and tree volume strongly affected the total on-target deposition, further confirming previous claims that ground surface area alone is an incorrect measure for dose calculation in fruit trees. status: publishe...|$|R

Therefore, finding the optimal combination between these different designs and the various tree architectures should be the first step in any optimization analysis. To this end, three different designs of air assisted orchard sprayers are compared in this work for the apple classical training system using computational fluid dynamics.

In spring 2007 canopy architectural data (3 D internode coordinate and diameter) of pear trees (Pyrus communis) was collected in an experimental orchard (PCfruit, Sint-Truiden, Belgium). The data were converted into 3 D virtual geometries using the representation method. A porous sub-domain was created around {{each part of the}} canopy elements to represent the coverage of the leaves. The effect of the entire canopy on air and particle flow from a cross flow <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> (BAB-Bamps, Sint-Truiden, Belgium) was modelled by integrating 3 D canopy architecture and porous media models that involve momentum and kinetic energy losses.

40|$|Spray drift can {{be defined}} as the {{quantity}} of plant protection product that is carried out of the sprayed area by the action of air currents during the application process. Efficacy of pesticide applications in orchards and vineyards is highly dependent on matching the canopy characteristics with the liquid distribution on a vertical plane, this being influenced by the type of sprayer, the nozzle orientation and air outlet adjustment. Two simple vertical patternators were designed and developed with the express purpose to be used in field conditions for the adjustment of vineyard canopy <b>sprayers.</b> Three different <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> were selected for comparative field trials of two new patternators with an already commercially available portable vertical patternator designed at University of Turin (Italy). The objective was to evaluate their efficiency in terms of spray recovery, symmetry and repeatability. Results show the ability of the two prototypes to measure the vertical distribution of liquid, as well as the important similarities between the liquid distribution profiles obtained with both patternators in comparison to the reference one. Trials conducted with the three different <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> show the suitability of this kind of tool, not only for research purposes but also for training activities and as part of the sprayer calibration process.

40|$|This {{project was}} aimed at {{providing}} {{better understanding of the}} interactions between the jets produced by air assisted <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> and the plant canopies to which they apply pesticide products. In addition, it sought to discover what scope there is for changing pesticide application practices in UK orchards. Laboratory scale experiments were used to gain understanding of the behaviour of two dimensional air jets impinging on a range of porous structures. Flow visualisations were used to obtain a general idea of the flow patterns produced and detailed measurements gave quantification of the jet's behaviour. Measurements of a jet impinging on a single screen showed that the jet's behaviour could be described in terms of the variation of the axial volume flow and the momentum flux across and downstream of the screen. Further to this, it was shown that the behaviour of a jet impinging on arrays of porous screens could be equated to the impingement of the jet on subsequent screens as if they were in isolation. This finding applied for screens at spacings greater than four times the repeating length scale of the screen (i. e. the hole pitch). Measurements with moving jets showed that the momentum flux was unaffected by the jet's movement but that the axial volume flow increased with jet traverse speed. A questionnaire survey of UK growers was used to gather information on practices within orchards. This showed a continuing shift in growing practices towards dwarfing rootstocks, a change in application methods towards low volume spray application, but a continuing preference for the axial fan design of <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers.</b> Of the sprayers being used by respondents to the survey, 45 % were over ten years old. The findings on jet flow through porous obstacles gives an understanding of the fundamental interactions involved in the operation of <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers.</b> A discussion of the findings in terms of the interactions between sprayer jet's and plant structures demonstrated that the canopy density is likely to have a large influence on the spray drift production. Further work is proposed that would quantify the level of drift that would be produced by an industry standard sprayer for a given canopy density. Applying the optimum canopy density for minimal drift would then be a possible strategy for reducing spray drift. The results of the survey suggested that such a strategy could be of some appeal to growers who are reluctant to change spray machinery but have made changes to growing systems over the years...|$|R

Directly after the completion of the leaf-fall large amounts of leaves were gathered in the orchard to be over wintered in wire mesh cages on the open ground.

However, this may {{increase the risk of}} spray drift if orchardists’ do not adjust spraying practices to match shorter dwarf varieties of fruit trees as compared with larger more traditional canopies as dwarf trees have less foliage to intercept spray. Two studies were carried out to examine the off-target movement and total spray usage of the spray from a conventional air-blast sprayer as compared with two experimental sensor sprayers using either ultrasonic or LiDAR technology. The experimental sensor sprayer was set to spray only when canopy was present. The first study assessed three treatments including a conventional <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> and a single row ultrasonic sensor sprayer with sensors either ON or OFF.

40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates the}} basic elements of a prototype automated <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> which delivers pesticide spray selectively with respect to the characteristics of the targets. The density of an apple tree canopy was detected by PROWAVE 400 EP 250 ultrasound sensors controlled by a Cypress PSOC CY 8 C 29466 microcontroller. The ultrasound signal was processed with an embedded computer built around a LPC 1343 microcontroller and fed in real time to electro-magnetic valves which open/close spraying nozzles in relation to the canopy structure. The analysis focuses on the detection of appropriate thresholds on 15 cm ultrasound bands, which correspond to maximal response to tree density, and this was selected for accurate spraying guidance. Evaluation of the system was performed in an apple orchard by detecting deposits of tartrazine dye (TD) on apple leaves. The employment of programmable microcontrollers and electro-magnetic valves decreased the amount of spray delivered by up to 48. 15 %. In contrast, the reduction of TD was only up to 37. 7 % at some positions within the tree crown and 65. 1 % in the gaps between trees.

In orchards spray process it is used an agricultural equipment, called sprayer, that consists of a reservoir and fans, these being mounted over an articulated tower, which {{is supported by a}} vehicle suspension [1].

Canopy architectural data (3 -D internode coordinates and diameter) of pear trees (Pyrus communis) were collected in an experimental orchard (PCfruit, Sint-Truiden, Belgium) in spring 2007. The data were converted into 3 -D virtual geometries with porous sub-domains created around {{each part of the}} canopy elements to represent the coverage of the leaves. A closure model used in the porous sub-domain considers momentum and kinetic energy losses that are functions of leaf area density (A) and drag coefficient (Cd). The model was applied to a cross flow <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> (BAB-Bamps, Sint-Truiden, Belgium). The flow of air (continuous phase) was solved using the Navier-Stokes equations and the k-ε turbulence model and the water droplets (discrete phase) in air were tracked using a Lagrangian particle tracking multiphase flow model. The model was implemented in ANSYS-CFX- 11. 00 (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, USA) in steady state conditions. Simulations were made for A of 1, 3 and 5 (m- 1) with Cd of 0. 2 for all the trees and each of them were compared with simulations on bare trees. The jet velocity at the wake was well above 10 m/s for bare trees of all years within the sprayer height and this value decreased with increasing A. A similar behaviour was seen also in the normalized droplet concentration. At the wake more droplets were drifted to the ground on leafed trees than bare trees because considerable amount of droplets decay faster as they lose their velocity in the porous region. Particles drifting to the atmosphere were more on bare trees than leafed trees.

Furthermore, canopies are spatially variable, and a uniform dose may not be adequate for the entire orchard. Spraying at an adequate volume application rate on a site-specific basis would help {{reduce the amount of}} agrochemicals used in the framework of precision horticulture and precision fructiculture. An <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> prototype running a variable-rate algorithm to adapt the volume application rate to the canopy volume in orchards on a real-time and continuous basis was designed, implemented, and validated. An equivalent prototype was designed for vineyards and described in a companion paper (‘Variable rate sprayer. Part 2 – Vineyard prototype: Design, implementation and validation’). The orchard prototype was divided into three parts: the canopy characterization system (using a LiDAR sensor), the controller executing a variable-rate algorithm, and the actuators. The controller determines the intended flow rate by using an application coefficient (required liquid volume per unit canopy volume) to convert canopy volume into a flow rate. The sprayed flow rates are adjusted via electromagnetic variable-rate valves. The goal of the prototype was to keep the actual application coefficients {{as close as possible to}} the objective. Strong relationships were observed between the intended and the sprayed flow rates (R 2 = 0. 935) and between the canopy cross-sectional areas and the sprayed flow rates (R 2 = 0. 926).

Therefore calibration for <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> should in particular include aspects regarding spray volume determination, airflow adjustment and selection of the type, number and configuration of nozzles, aiming at high spray application quality and its environmental impact. Spray volume adapted to specific orchard may be calculated based on Tree Row Volume concept. The air flow setting includes adjustment of air volume/velocity, air flow range and air- flow direction/deflection. The type, number and configuration of nozzles are selected aiming at enhanced deposition and distribution of spray in the crop canopy, and reduced spray drift. The practical methods of calibration considering these aspects are proposed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Among the {{possible}} sources of environmental contamination by plant protection products, {{the use of}} air blast <b>sprayers</b> in <b>orchards</b> and vineyards can be very critical. The evaluation of the vertical distribution pattern is a crucial test to achieve a good quality of spray application. The aim of the paper was to compare {{the performance of a}} vertical lamel-late patternator versus a horizontal lamellate patternator. For this aim, an experimental device that allows the use of the same patternator, mounting the lamellae either horizontally or vertically, was utilized. The results showed that using the patternator with vertical lamellae a greater amount of liquid, 25 %, was collected than using the horizontal lamellae under the same test conditions. This amount represented the 36. 7 % of the total sprayed volume. The performance of patternator {{may be related to the}} reduced disturbance of the air flow induced by vertical lamellae. Although the amount of liquid col-lection is not considered the only parameter to assess the quality of a patternator, this characteristic can improve the effi-ciency of the test, especially when low volume <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> are tested...|$|R
40|$|In Belgium, the {{inspection}} of sprayers is performed by official and mobile teams ruled by two regional inspection authorities, ILVO and CRA-W. The management of {{the inspection}} {{is done by the}} Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection, Public Health and the Environment (FAVV). Inspection authorities need to have an ISO 17020 certification, consequently the Belgian inspection is completely independent and objective. FAVV delegates the inspection to one inspection service per region (one for the Walloon part and one for the Flemish part). In this way inspection results are centralized and easily consultable. The inspection results are a very useful tool to have an overview of the general condition of the Belgian sprayers. Those results can be helpful when advising on changes in legislation. They can also be used as an instrument to advise fruit growers and farmers how to improve their spraying machines, r what points they {{have to pay attention to}} when buying a new or second-hand machine. Therefore, a detailed overview is made of the inspection results on <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> for the 5 th inspection cyclus (3 years: 2008 - 2009 - 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{necessary}} {{plant protection}} in orchards, spray drops are transported to {{and into the}} apple tree canopy with an air jet from a fan sprayer. The interaction between the spray air jet and the canopy is central to effective droplet transport, spray coverage and pest control. Converging air jets were introduced {{as a way of}} improving the spray application. In this study, a two unit cross-flow fan <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer,</b> configured as converging or plane (vertical fan units) air jets, were compared in several experiments. Inclining the top or bottom fans towards the tree created different types of converging air jets. The influence of these air jets on spray deposition, on air velocities and on forces acting on apple trees was measured. Deposition was measured throughout the season with fluorescent tracer on leaf sized filterpaper targets inside canopies. Different types of air velocity measurements were made with the fan sprayer passing the tree. Peak velocities were recorded at positions throughout apple tree canopies, and indepth measurements of several air velocity parameters were made inside, above and beyond an apple tree canopy. Velocity pulse values were integrated over time. Air velocity profiles were measured in stationary situations and compared to existing mathematical models. Forces and moments caused by the air jet striking the tree were measured with a new method, utilizing a multicomponent force transducer, placed between the tree trunk and the ground. Compared to plane air jets, converging air jets resulted in significantly higher deposition values, more uniformly distributed through the canopy. The converging air jets increased the air velocity parameters in the denser parts of the canopy, and resulted in higher air power and energy at those positions. Converging air jets transferred greater forces to the canopy. This could be explained by the ability of the converging air jets to reduce the air flow directed above the trees, thereby concentrate and increase the amount of spray liquid, penetrating into the densest part of the canopy. Finally, an increased air velocity improved deposition prerequisites. The new method for measuring forces and moments has a potential to extend and complement other application technology measuring methods.

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{modelling}} flow phenomena within trees {{such as in}} orchards follows the assumption of the space occupied by the trees as a porous and horizontally homogeneous medium to avoid the flow details associated with the individual plants. This being sufficient at a larger field or regional scale much {{has to be done}} at a plant scale to analyse the flow details within the plant and its elements especially for sensitive agricultural operations such as spraying. This article presents an integrated 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of airflow from a two-fan air-assisted cross-flow <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> through non-leafed orchard pear trees of 3 m average height. In this model the effect of the solid part of the canopy on airflow was modelled by directly introducing the actual 3 D architecture of the canopy into the CFD model. The effect of small canopy parts, such as very short and thin branches and flowers that were not incorporated in the geometrical model, on airflow was simulated by introducing source-sink terms in the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) momentum and k-epsilon turbulence equations in a sub-domain created around the branches. This model was implemented in a CFD code of ANSYS-CFX- 11. 0 (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). In this work it was possible to link the real 3 D architecture of pear canopy into a CFD code of CFX. The model was able to capture the local effects of the canopy and its parts on wind and sprayer airflow directly by inserting the tree structure into the model which gave realistic results. The model showed that within the injection region of the sprayer there was an average reduction of the jet velocity by 1 m s(- 1) for a distance of 2. 3 m from the sprayer outlet due to the presence of leafless pear canopy. This reduction was variable at different vertical positions due to the difference in the canopy, density. Maximal effect of the canopy was observed in the middle height of the trees between 0. 25 m and 2. 5 m which is the denser region with a bunch of several branches. The maximum velocity difference observed between these two positions was 1. 35 m s(- 1) at 1. 75 m height. Thus, regions of high and low air velocity zones of the sprayer due to the variable branch density of the pear tree were predicted. The effects of wind speed and direction on the air jet from the sprayer were investigated using the model. For a cross- (direction of 90 degrees) wind speed of 5 m s(- 1) there was about 2 m s(- 1) reduction in the sprayer jet velocity at the jet centre and 0. 5 m horizontal shift of the jet centre towards the wind direction. Generally there was a decrease in the jet velocity with increasing cross-wind and decreasing wind direction with respect to the jet direction. 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The Environmental {{and health}} risks of {{pesticide}} application {{have been the}} subject of research for more than fifty years and still continue to be a great concern. Ground/surface water contamination and bystander exposure from pesticide drift occurring during and after application and health risks of excessive pesticide residues detected on agricultural products are continuously in the spotlight. Orchard spray application received special emphasis due to the relatively large amount of pesticides applied and the complexity of the process involved. Both experimental and modelling approaches have been used in the past to determine pesticide drift for regulatory risk assessment studies. However, the complexity and variability of the drift process and the efforts needed for a proper analysis remain considerable hurdles in development of approaches to mitigate negative impacts of spraying. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to contribute to the understanding of spray deposition and drift in orchards by developing a mechanistic drift model of the air assisted spray process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An integrated research approach combining experiments and simulations was used throughout the thesis. Spray nozzles and three different air-assisted <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayer</b> designs (a cross-flow sprayer, an axial sprayer and a sprayer with individual spouts) were first characterized under controlled laboratory conditions in terms of their spray liquid distribution and air flow pattern. The results obtained from this indoor trials were used to validate a CFD orchard spray model. The results obtained from both the experiment and the CFD model showed important differences in air flow pattern and liquid distribution generated by the different sprayer designs. It was also seen that the liquid distribution follows the air flow pattern which is strongly influenced by the architecture of the air discharge unit on the sprayers. The CFD model was further used to optimize the outlet design of the sprayer with individual spouts. The measurement and modelling of the spray distribution was done at this stage using a vertical patternator wall rather than the actual trees. An extensive field trial was then performed using the three air assisted orchard sprayers designs and four different training systems of apple and pear to investigate the effect of tree architecture on spray distribution and to check whether the differences in air flow profiles among the three sprayer designs affect the on-target spray distribution. The results obtained showed that total leaf cover, leaf wall porosity and tree volume strongly affected the total on-target deposition. There was a strong relationship between the vertical leaf deposition profile and the air flow pattern from the sprayers. Predicted vertical deposition profiles from a canopy CFD model of spray application in orchards that incorporates the actual tree architecture, were validated against experimental profiles. This CFD model was then used to assess the effect of wind and sprayer design on spray distribution within the four training systems. The analysis performed on the axial sprayer using the CFD model showed that wind blowing in the direction of spraying actually gave the largest deposition on the tree, constraining the spray in the canopy region. A wind direction opposite to the spraying direction, however, resulted in an increase of the ground deposition and the amount of spray remaining in air. Further analysis on the effect of increasing the magnitude of a cross flow wind showed an increase in the off-target spray distribution. The CFD model was further elaborated to predict spray drift from orchard sprayers away from the orchard. This model was validated against drift measurements from an apple orchard with different nozzle arrangements. The model predicted the transient spray profile, calculates the fraction captured by the trees, the airborne spray and the ground deposition up to 40 m from the last tree row in agreement with the measured profiles. This model was then used to evaluate the effect of drift reducing nozzles and fan speed on drift. Drift reducing nozzles reduced the drift distance (the maximum downstream distance droplets travel behind the target canopy), but increased near-tree ground deposition. Further analysis done using different nozzle arrangements showed that the increase in ground deposition near the tree can be avoided (keeping the reduction in the drift distance) by combining the drift reducing nozzles with the standard ones. A reduced sprayer airflow resulted in further reduction of the percentage drift. The analysis showed that the model can be used to analyse different drift mitigation strategies and perform sprayer optimization. Future investigations could focus on developing a database of drift curves that are obtained from in silico experiments performed under different orchard spraying scenarios using the developed model. These drift curves could then be used to develop online drift monitoring tools or combined with recommended drift mitigation scenarios to be used by applicators. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{agricultural}} sprayers {{is determined by}} their ability to maintain the balance between on- and off-target deposition. In order to address some orchard spraying issues, the performance of three <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> (BAB Duoprop, Hardi Condor V and Hardi Tango) are characterized using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The right sides of the sprayers were modelled at high fan speed settings for airflow. Albuz ATR orange and red nozzles, respectively, {{for the first two}} and for the last sprayer were used for spray flow. The CFD models represent controlled trials carried out indoor using artificial pear trees made of wooden stalk and ficus branches. All sprayers showed poor deposition on the top part of the canopy with the best results for the Duoprop and the worst for the Condor V. Though both sprayers showed high off-target deposition above 2 m, the greatest losses were found for the Condor V. Generally Duoprop sprayer gave the highest leaf deposition and Tango the least. The model proved that the magnitude, pattern and uniformity of the airflow from the sprayers dictates the spray flow and deposition. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{time frames}} caused by {{infection}} threat and weather demand for efficient pesticide application techniques in modern integrated and organic fruit farming. This demand is best complied by low volume spraying, since it minimizes traveling time {{and number of}} fillings per spray treatment, but also minimizes {{the probability of a}} contamination of the operator with concentrated pesticides. To obtain good spray deposition, low volume spray application demands small droplets which offer numerous benefits, but also carry a high drift potential. This feature threatened the technique, because no method for spray drift reduction has been available in order to make use of reduced buffer zones to water courses and non-target areas. A new method based on cross flow characteristics of the sprayer fan, canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed and a mixed set of hollow cone nozzles and air induction nozzles resulted in an approx. 85 % reduction of particle drift deposits, so that the method has been registered in the official German list of drift reducing devices in the 75 % drift reduction class. Besides drift reduction a canopy adapted fan speed also results in an enormous reduction of fuel consumption and noise emission as further environmental benefits of small droplets. An assessment of the influence of a canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed on spray deposit, relative spray coverage and droplet deposit density revealed a significant increase of the application efficiency, rising with decreasing canopy width and compensating a reduction of water volume and dose rate from canopy related dosing models. Testing a tower <b>sprayer</b> in <b>orchards</b> for use with reduced fan speed unexpectedly showed an unusable vertical air distribution. Alarmed by this finding, a subsequent testing of various fan types on a test bench disclosed a very unsatisfying vertical air distribution of many fan types and even within a production series the air distribution differed enormously. Especially an uneven horizontal reach of the air stream over working height is a major obstacle for a successful use of canopy adapted fan speed with all its benefits. Since a uniform vertical air distribution is the basic requirement for a highly efficient and environmentally safer spray application {{not only in terms of}} the potential to reduce pesticide consumption, but also for reducing fuel consumption and noise emissions, testing and adjusting fans of <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers</b> on a test bench is urgently needed. Because of the importance of the topic, three fruit growers associations in Austria, Italy and Germany together initiated the development of a new test bench to measure vertical air distribution of <b>orchard</b> <b>sprayers...</b>|$|R
40|$|According to the EU {{directive}} {{on sustainable}} {{use of pesticides}} the pesticide users have to be trained on sprayer calibration. A high educative effect of trainings can only be achieved if trainees are motivated and interested in the training, and when the training is performed by the trainer with high competence and practical skills. A concept and programme of calibration training was developed, and then tested by performing the training for trainers. The event was organised in the Research Institute of Horticulture, Skierniewice, Poland, within the Safe Use Initiative (ECPA project). The 10 -hour training programme was composed so that the ratio of theory to practice was 40 %/ 60 %.
