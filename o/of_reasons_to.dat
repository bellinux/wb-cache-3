The nation would not return to the Games until 1980, after the white-dominated government had fallen and the country had been renamed Zimbabwe.

Music makes the people come together, she sang in the finale– together, that is, if Madonna is clearly in charge."

2500|$|Davidson's most noted {{work began}} in 1963 with an essay, [...] "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," [...] which {{attempted}} to refute the prevailing orthodox view, widely attributed to Ludwig Wittgenstein but already present in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, that an agent's reasons for acting cannot be {{the causes of}} his action (Malpas, 2005, §2). [...] Instead, Davidson argued that, [...] "rationalization (the providing <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> explain an agent's actions) is a species of ordinary causal explanation" [...] (1963, p.685). In particular, action A is explained by what Davidson called a primary reason, which involves a pro-attitude (roughly, a desire) toward some goal G and an instrumental belief that performing action A is a means to attaining G. For example, someone's primary reason for taking an umbrella outside on a rainy day might be that wanting to stay dry and believing that taking an umbrella is a means to stay dry today.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{model to}} explain copycat suicide, called [...] "social proof" [...] by Cialdini, {{goes beyond the}} theories of glorification and simplification <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> look at why copycat suicides are so similar, demographically and in actual methods, to the original publicized suicide. In the social proof model, people imitate those who seem similar, despite or even because of societal disapproval. This model {{is important because it}} has nearly opposite ramifications for what the media ought to do about the copycat suicide effect than the standard model does. To deal with this problem, Alex Mesoudi of Queen Mary University, London, developed a computer model of a community of 1000 people, to examine how copycat suicides occur. These were divided into 100 groups of 10, in a model designed to represent different levels of social organization, such as schools or hospitals within a town or state. Mesoudi then circulated the simulation through 100 generations. He found the simulated people acted just as sociologists' theory predicted. They were more likely to die by suicide in clusters, either because they had learned this trait from their friends, or because suicidal {{people are more likely to}} be like one another.|$|E
