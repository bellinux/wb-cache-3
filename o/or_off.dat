5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 196566 Ashes series while regular captain Bob Simpson was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace <b>or</b> <b>off</b> spin. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge spin bowlers. Booth {{was known for his}} sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.|$|E
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap <b>or</b> <b>off</b> the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E

5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on <b>or</b> <b>off</b> of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E

For Trinidad, he was one of the cricketers instrumental in breaking the dominance of the Barbados cricket team in the Inter-Colonial Tournament. He first played for West Indies in 1912–13 and, after the First World War, was chosen to tour England twice. He was moderately successful on the 1923 tour, but was less effective in 1928. Small played in the middle of the batting order; he bowled either medium-fast <b>or</b> <b>off</b> breaks. He died in 1958.|$|E

5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly <b>or</b> <b>off</b> the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} American War of Independence {{she spent the}} last three years of the war off the American coast, and saw action at the Battle of Cape Henry and at the Battle of the Chesapeake. The years of peace were spent either in the Caribbean <b>or</b> <b>off</b> Nova Scotia, before the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars saw her commissioned for service in the Leeward Islands and off the British coast. It was while serving in British waters that she became caught up in the mutiny at the Nore. As one of only two two-decker ships to remain in action during the mutiny she had to maintain the Dutch blockade by creating the illusion of being part of a larger fleet, which she managed successfully. Adamant then went on to fight at the Battle of Camperdown, after which she moved to the English Channel, and then the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. Here she took part in the destruction of the French commerce raider Preneuse, and in her later years captured a number of privateers. She became a receiving ship and flagship of a port admiral during the last years of the Napoleonic Wars, until being broken up in June 1814.|$|E

5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on <b>or</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cimarron Turnpike, {{carrying}} US-412, {{passes through}} Noble, Payne, and Pawnee Counties. The highway heads east from I-35 {{to its first}} interchange, Exit 3, which provides access to US-77. The first mainline toll plaza is just west of Exit 15, a cloverleaf interchange with no straight-line ramps (forcing all traffic getting on <b>or</b> <b>off</b> {{to pass through the}} toll plaza) connecting the turnpike to US-177. East of the US-177 interchange, the highway curves to the south, crossing Black Bear Creek. US-412 then meets US-64 once again, interchanging with it at Exit 23 east of Morrison. The turnpike then turns back east, with a spur route (accessible only from the westbound turnpike) branching off to the southwest toward Stillwater. The Lone Chimney service plaza, a twenty-four-hour concession area, is located in the median of the turnpike east of the interchange with the spur. South of Pawnee lies an interchange (Exit 37) with SH-18. Just south of Hallett, a second mainline toll plaza sits just west of the SH-99 interchange; again, this interchange is a cloverleaf interchange with only loop ramps. The turnpike's final exit is Exit 60, a partial interchange with SH-48 southeast of Cleveland. The missing movements are provided by US-64, the northern terminus of SH-48, which merges with US-412 as the Cimarron Turnpike ends. The two routes continue east as a freeway.|$|E
