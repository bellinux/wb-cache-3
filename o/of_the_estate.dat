50|$|Croes became {{politically}} active for the Aruban People's Party {{and in the}} 2009 general election he obtained a seat in <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> <b>of</b> Aruba with 1578 votes.

5|$|During the 19thcentury {{the estate}} was again {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal {{was replaced by the}} Manchester Ship Canal, and the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current SirRichard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust {{for the benefit of the}} public.|$|E
5|$|Forglen {{became the}} main family {{residence}} of the Ogilvy family during the 18th century and marked the onset of significant development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> The 7th Lord Banff, Alexander, who inherited the estate from his grandfather in 1727, began planting trees and organising plantations. He died at Forglen on 1 December 1771. As Alexander's eldest son, also named Alexander, had pre-deceased him, his second son, William, inherited and became the 8th Lord Banff. William, a former army captain who served under the Duke of York, continued the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> until his death at Forglen on 4 June 1803. The lands were then inherited by William's sister, Lady Jane Abercromby, who had married Sir George Abercromby of Birkenbog and the peerage of Lord Banff became dormant.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

5|$|Lord Ashcombe's son, Henry, married Maud, {{whose father}} was Colonel Archibald Motteaux Calvert, in 1890. The couple lived on the estate near Bramley and had six sons. Their three eldest sons {{were killed in the}} First World War while on active service. Like his father, Henry {{followed}} a political career, becoming Lord Lieutenant of Surrey in 1905; that year Henry moved to the mansion house after his father decamped to London following the death of Henry's mother. He inherited the title and extensive estate {{after the death of his}} father in 1917. The payment of death duties and the upkeep of large estates during the war resulted in large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> being auctioned on 19 September 1921. A total of £30,400 was raised by the sale of sixty-nine lots– tallying around – of land and property on the periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> just south of the railway line. Further land situated closer to Dorking town centre was sold for development in the 1930s. The break up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> continued after Henry's death on 27 October 1947 when it was inherited by his fourth son Roland, who became the third Lord Ashcombe.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> or <b>the</b> States (États, Landstände, Staten) was <b>the</b> {{assembly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realm, <b>the</b> divisions <b>of</b> {{society in}} feudal times, called together {{for purposes of}} deliberation, legislation or taxation. A meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> that covered an entire kingdom was called an estates general.|$|R
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates.</b> He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their <b>estates</b> (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and <b>the</b> upholding <b>of</b> serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> Theatre has {{undergone}} several {{changes in its}} history. It first acquired the name Royal Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> in 1798 when it was purchased by <b>the</b> Czech <b>Estates.</b> With <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Provisional Theatre in 1862, <b>the</b> Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> was dedicated to a German ensemble and renamed the Royal Provincial German Theatre. During the period between 1920 and 1948 the theatre regained <b>the</b> name Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> and became affiliated with the National Theatre. In 1948 the theatre was renamed the Tyl Theatre (after dramatist J.K. Tyl) and would be known as such until 1990 when, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> an eight-year reconstruction project, it became known again as <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> Theatre.|$|R
5|$|Terraces {{of shops}} were {{built around the}} fringes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> both to cater for the {{residents}} of Noel Park and for residents of the expanding suburb of Wood Green and the users of the adjacent railway station. The designs of the terraces varied, from short terraces of small shops {{on the edges of}} the less-visited eastern portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> to parades of large shops on Wood Green High Road near the railway station.|$|E
5|$|The {{local council}} Filwood ward is roughly coterminous with Knowle West, but two small areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> {{lie in the}} {{neighbouring}} Knowle ward. Definitions of the area of Knowle West vary, with some residents in the eastern fringes preferring to identify with Knowle.|$|E
5|$|The nearby 19th century house, Stonelands also formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> so Repton {{ensured that}} it would be visible from the parkland. Stonelands no longer forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> but is still visible from the park and wood. Towards the end of the 19th century, the house's park land was open to the public on certain days of the week by Peter Arthur Marsham Hoare, however this {{practice}} had ended by 1902. The grounds were still regularly opened for events such as fetes, the Dawlish flower show, as well as opening the gardens to the public.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of the Member {{intestate}} in 1820, the estate was inherited by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748–1820), who died shortly after inheriting the estate. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop the estate by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling debts, and although the estate had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms and other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the estate was mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.|$|E

The lake is used regularly by local fishermen, and a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> is seldom used by local residents, {{many of whom are}} completely unaware of it.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the estate}} {{had been broken}} up into fifteen smaller farms. The rough {{northern}} meadows adjacent to the Moselle were used for beef farming, whilst the southern fields, known as Grainger's Farm, were used as grazing land. The western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was by this time occupied by the Great Eastern Railway's Palace Gates Line and Green Lanes railway station, opened in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Chauncey Thomas died at {{his home}} in Shohola on October 5, 1882, sixteen years after the new bridge was repaired.
