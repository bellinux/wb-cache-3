5|$|Observations of the {{large-scale}} {{structure of the}} Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos.</b> Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition.

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences.

5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{remained}} at Cornell until 1964, {{when he went}} to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He remained there for the remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering, an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars. He returned to this in 1976, applying his model to the radio galaxy Cygnus A.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> that he created, and even Isis, though {{she was said to}} be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos,</b> Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos,</b> with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E

30|$|The {{great power}} {{structures}} in Hellenism and the Roman Empire {{called into question}} the relationship between citizens and community, between man and the world. The Stoics compared <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> in its ideal order with the real political conditions. In Seneca the cosmic res publica is free from <b>the</b> grievances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> his time. <b>The</b> <b>cosmos</b> itself appeared {{to him as a}} “world state”. It could be a “state that is common to gods and people” (Wildberger 2006, 246). May man withdraw from real political affairs, as Seneca did; as a citizen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> remains his home. This is where his life is based, and even without a political office he has an obligation to work in it sensibly with his ability to think and act. The homeliness and the tasks in the world reflect the shelter and the tasks in the oikos; politics seems to be an intermediate way of fulfilling these tasks. Only house and world are elementary.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E
5|$|Rudra's {{evolution}} from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the Shvetashvatara text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva {{is identified as}} the creator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also {{marks the beginning of}} the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BC) and in the Mahabharata. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Chinese made careful {{observations}} of heavenly bodies and phenomena since observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> {{were used for}} astrology and prognostication. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi {{was the first in}} history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as thought in the West after Einhard's observation in 807 CE), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE). Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui Han tombs site, Changsha, Hunan province), the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.|$|E

5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos,</b> described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions {{of the events of}} creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{building}} was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods {{were believed to}} be present in these images, suffusing the temple with sacred power. Symbols of places in Egypt or parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos</b> enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, emblematic of the temple's purpose rather than real events. For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his broader role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.|$|E
5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmos,</b> {{the moon and the}} earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E
