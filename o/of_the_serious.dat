5|$|Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serious</b> Crime Squad {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} {{investigation}} a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October. The inquiry became the largest {{in the history of the}} Metropolitan Police, with 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler. He became a detective chief superintendent in March, 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious</b> effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

25|$|Chief Justice Warren dissented, {{expressing the}} view that Ohio should not be {{compelled}} to place the candidates of either the American Independent Party or the Socialist Labor Party on the ballot for the impending presidential election.

25|$|Hitchens was {{critical}} of the New Labour government, in particular its planned introduction of national identity cards, its attempts to abolish jury trial, and its creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serious</b> Organised Crime Agency. He also opposes the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Hitchens views these developments both as an attack on liberty and as facets of a constitutional revolution.|$|E

25|$|While the band's United States {{audience}} remained mainly African-American in this period, the Ellington orchestra had {{a significant}} following overseas, exemplified {{by the success of}} their trip to England and Scotland in 1933 and their 1934 visit to the European mainland. The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious</b> music community, including composer Constant Lambert, which gave a boost to Ellington's interest in composing longer works.|$|E

A child born from another man to an agunah is considered a mamzer (halakhically illegitimate), and may only marry another mamzer or a convert.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious</b> fire damage, Hoffman {{decided to}} go to Chicago to inspect the camp himself, {{arriving}} on November 15, 1863. DeLand bribed prisoners with whiskey to clean up the camp for Hoffman's visit. On November 18, 1863, Brigadier General William W. Orme, who reported directly to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, showed up to inspect the camp in preparation for Orme taking over command. Orme noted that the garrison of 876 men was dangerously small and that sixty–one men had escaped in the preceding three months.|$|E

25|$|On 30 August 2014 Collins {{resigned}} her Cabinet positions {{following the}} leak of another e-mail written by Slater in 2011 which suggested {{she had also}} attempted to undermine another public servant, Adam Feeley. Feeley was Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serious</b> Fraud Office (SFO) and Collins was the Minister responsible for the SFO at the time. Collins says she resigned because she believed the attacks on her had become a distraction for the National party {{leading up to the}} election.

25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious,</b> even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E

The petitioners also are asking the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that {{set up in the}} wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious,</b> though less severe, 1979 Three Mile Island accident.

These sanctions would in no case involve imprisonment.

The format {{of the first two}} series exposed Woodall and Constantine to particular criticism that questioned whether they were qualified to deal with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>serious</b> issues raised. Trinny & Susannah Undress... has also been shown on various other television stations including The Lifestyle Channel in Australia.
