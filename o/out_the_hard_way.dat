Having found <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> that [...] "banter doesn't always work", she becomes quieter and [...] "not as mouthy". The {{character}} [...] "called the shots" [...] in her final appearance, and was the [...] "bigger person" [...] by forcing everyone to accept {{the reality of the}} situation. After years of hunting together, the relationship between Jo and Ellen also develops; Tal came to view them more as equals rather than daughter and mother. Although Jo's feelings for Dean remain the same, Tal liked the fact that she does not easily give in to Dean's advances in [...] "Abandon All Hope...". She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave it a little more meaning". When asked about the kiss that Dean gives to Jo when she is dying, Tal explained that she interpreted the kiss as Dean [...] "really seeing [...] and thanking [...] and appreciating [...] For him, at that particular moment, {{there was no other way}} to express it but with a kiss." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{attempting}} to relegate poem codes to emergency use, he enhanced their security by promoting {{the use of}} original poems in preference to widely known ones, forcing a cryptanalyst to work it <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> for each message instead of guessing an agent's entire set of keys after breaking {{the key to a}} single message (or possibly just part of the key.) Marks wrote many poems later used by agents, the most famous being one he gave to the agent Violette Szabo, The Life That I Have, which gained popularity when it was used in the 1958 film about her, Carve Her Name With Pride. [...] According to his book, Marks wrote the poem in Christmas 1943 about a girlfriend, Ruth, who had recently died in an air crash in Canada; supposedly the god-daughter of the head of SOE, Sir Charles Jocelyn Hambro.|$|E

Of these pre-professional times, Smith was to say: [...] "You find <b>out</b> about survival <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way.</b> When I joined my first senior club in Dundee, {{there was an old}} prop called Danny Herrington, a bit of a local legend, who basically shoved my head up my arse in training, twice a week every week for what seemed like years. Now, that's what you call a learning curve. Those training sessions were my classroom." ...|$|R
50|$|Just as {{it looks}} like Dingledong will corner Woody, Woody whips out an atom blaster ray gun and fires it at Dingledong.

50|$|OK, I give in. King Cnut {{had to find}} <b>out</b> his limits <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> and so, it seems, do I. If a {{man with}} a singing voice of as unmistakably high a quality as Lemar's can resort to a bit of autotune, {{everyone}} else might as well opt for a robo-tracheotomy and have done with it.At least he's using it well, following the Cher model, where you slightly and subtly androiderise your all-too meaty voice so that it sits better among the unyielding electronica. It's a bit like having a USB port soldered into your neck. Slightly painful, but a useful way to get two different operating systems to interface effectively*.The other model is {{to use it as a}} kind of robo-polyfilla, where all vocal cracks are given a smooth metallic outer coating because the voice inside would simply collapse without it. If asked, all singers and producers will claim that this model does not actually exist, and that they are all dabbling with this hot new production technique for genuine artistic reasons. And because everyone else is. The song was awarded a 4 star.|$|R
40|$|When I {{first started}} working on this {{dissertation}} and programming GironiMOO, I did not anticipate {{that it would take}} me well over a year to finish it. As it turned out, starting a business (and more importantly: running it), buying, selling and remodeling a house and writing a semi-combined dissertation for two degrees was a bit much to take on at once. Obviously, I could have guessed this in advance, but there are always those who have to find <b>out</b> these things <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way.</b> Apparently, I am one of them. From the new office in which I now miraculously find myself, I want to thank those people without whom it would probably have taken at least another year and a nervous breakdown to finish. First of all, I would like to thank John Nerbonne for his patience, help and support as my supervisor. As this dissertation is part of a joint project between English and Humanities Computing, I also want to thank Wander Lowie for his help and input from an English perspective. Secondly, I owe a huge amount of thanks to Jeroen for taking care of business in more ways than I can count. Thank you for your love and support, I could not have don...|$|R
