Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> we can get control through the Cooperative movement, some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> through political action, and others think through industrial action.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Hume left ABC for {{the fledgling}} Fox News Network for which {{his wife had}} {{recently}} become chief of the Washington bureau. At his last news conference as ABC's chief White House correspondent, President Clinton told him, [...] "I think all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> you have done an extraordinary, professional job under Republican and Democratic administrations alike." [...] Hume became Fox News's Washington managing editor.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Matthews of MSNBC {{referred}} to the speech as [...] "what many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> {{is one of the}} great speeches in American history, and we watch a lot of them." [...] Independent Women's Forum CEO and MSNBC political analyst Michelle Bernard said it was [...] "the best speech and most important speech on race that we have heard as a nation since Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{whenever}} {{he gets to}} the top of the steps at t'other end of the Yard,' said Mrs Plornish, 'he'll peep out in the curiousest way! So that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> he's peeping out towards where his own country is, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> he's looking for somebody he don't want to see, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> don't know what to think.' ...|$|R
500|$|Humans are [...] "systematically self deceived. Each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> {{ourselves}} as more competent and benevolent than we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We, the jury, do {{find that}} the remains come to their death {{at the hands of}} a {{mountain}} lion, but some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks,</b> all the same, they had fits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. Well, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> it is {{perfectly}} dreadful the way Jennie accepts Martell's invitations. Of course, we don't want to tell on her, either in school or to her folks, and yet none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> it is right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Shabaka," [...] he went on, [...] "in Persia royal {{blood is}} common also, though some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> it looks best {{when it is}} shed. What else are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is rather}} a difficulty," [...] said Deronda, smiling. [...] "I suppose I should have said, we each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be}} better for the other to be good." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cavanagh laughed. [...] "There! Having handed {{each other}} {{reciprocal}} bouquets, {{we can now}} tell Miss Wetherford the truth. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> very well <b>of</b> himself, and we're both believers in the New West." ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{justifications}} for Thaler's and Sunstein's endorsement of libertarian paternalism in Nudge draws on facts {{of human nature and}} psychology. [...] The book is critical of the homo economicus view of human beings [...] "that each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> and chooses unfailingly well, and thus fits within the textbook picture of human beings offered by economists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps that {{is better}} than {{following}} Gerald's example. But you mustn't be unjust. You know that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> thwarting you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{all think}} of things mainly {{from our own}} point of view first,' I answered. 'The {{difference}} is that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> of them from other people's afterwards. Motives are mixed.' ...|$|E
60|$|The King {{family had}} the honour of {{entertaining}} the Governor's wife to tea on February the seventeenth. We are all invited to visit Government House but some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> we won't go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Plagued, Mr. Moseley!" [...] said Grace, {{in a voice}} even {{softer than}} his own. [...] "I am sure--I am sure, we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> you or your dogs in the least a plague." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should, and {{you know}} that I would," [...] she answered. [...] "Everyone expects it <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I <b>think</b> myself that it would be more decent." ...|$|R
40|$|Our thinking, decisions, {{talking and}} {{behaviour}} {{are governed by}} inner programmes, called meta­ programmes. They are all equal. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> and is active within a preferential programme. It {{is very important that}} one is aware of these pro­grammes and the possibilities of changing them for they are of crucial importance in understand­ing ourselves as well as others. By training it is possible {{to make use of the}} desired programmes and thus find harmony and criteria for everybody...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My dear Miss Flora, you cannot make an omelette without {{breaking}} eggs,’ said I; ‘and {{it is no}} bagatelle to escape from Edinburgh Castle. One <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I <b>think,</b> was even killed.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. Battius {{wishes to}} say," [...] Ellen {{modestly}} interposed, [...] "that as some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> Asa is in danger, and some think otherwise, {{the whole family}} might pass {{an hour or two}} in looking for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't ascertained {{the cost}} just yet. As a rule, you don't {{make up the}} bill until you're through with the undertaking; {{and it may be}} a longer one than either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think.</b> Well, we might as well turn upon our tracks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Peter Craig {{thinks he}} saw the Family Ghost on Christmas Eve. But the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> all he saw was the white calf with the red tail. (PETER, MUTTERING SULKILY:--"It's a queer calf that would walk up on end and wring its hands.") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right!" [...] {{broke in}} Spud. [...] "What {{happened}} might {{have occurred to}} any <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I <b>think</b> {{we ought to be}} thankful that Songbird--that's the name we all call John, you know--wasn't killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Flora, you cannot make an omelette without {{breaking}} eggs," [...] said I; [...] "and {{it is no}} bagatelle to escape from Edinburgh Castle. One <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I <b>think,</b> was even killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they've a {{great deal}} of idea," [...] said the Prince. And nothing was easier than to mention the quantity. [...] "They <b>think</b> so much <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> They <b>think</b> in {{particular}} so much of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vane's {{expression}} changed. [...] "We haven't ascertained {{the cost}} just yet. As a rule, you don't {{make up the}} bill until you're through with the undertaking; {{and it may be}} a longer one than either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think.</b> Now we'll turn upon our tracks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} tellin' the truth, an' jest what all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think.</b> When the breeze freshened I {{made up my}} mind that the voyage was about ended; but here we are yet, an' here we're likely to be a spell longer unless we strike another norther." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You like it, my Emma, {{as little}} as I feared.--I wish our {{opinions}} were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make {{one or the other}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will hold}} about half <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> And <b>think</b> {{what it will}} be to be in there waiting till the rain shall be over! Everybody has been so good-humoured and now they will be so cross!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we don't," [...] she said, [...] "not those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>think.</b> We know {{we shall}} never oust man from his place. He {{will always be}} the greater. We want to help him; that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Of course,” cried Patsy, {{turning from}} Louise. “We’re a lot <b>of</b> ninnies. Let <b>us</b> <b>think</b> {{what is best}} to do and map out a logical program.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, and I think I said--didn't I? {{that if you}} {{insisted upon}} {{following}} these spiritual exercises, the result might be that they would return upon you in some concrete shape, and take possession of you, and lead you into company and surroundings which most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> it wholesome to avoid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little did any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think</b> that," [...] said Susan sharply, [...] "not being gifted {{with the}} power of prophecy. It does not require any great foresight, Sophia Crawford, to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over. I could do as much myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kate {{is in full}} fling to-night," [...] {{she said}} to the hostess. Lady Macquoich smiled ambiguously--so ambiguously that the consul thought it {{necessary}} to interfere for his friend. [...] "She seems to say what most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>think,</b> but I am afraid very few of us could voice as innocently," [...] he smilingly suggested.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interest}} {{caused by}} these actions led Mendelssohn to publish {{his most important}} contribution to the problems connected with the position of Judaism in a Gentile world. This was Jerusalem (1783; Eng. trans. 1838 and 1852). It is a forcible plea for freedom of conscience, described by Kant as [...] "an irrefutable book". Mendelssohn wrote:Brothers, if you care for true piety, let us not feign agreement, where diversity is evidently the plan and purpose of Providence. None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thinks</b> and feels exactly like his fellow man: why do we wish to deceive each other with delusive words? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] Janet {{was tempted}} to say, [...] "your syndicalism {{declares}} that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> should <b>think</b> or reason. We should only feel." [...] She was beginning to detect Rolfe's inconsistencies, yet she refrained from interrupting the inspirational flow.|$|R
5000|$|... “Here we {{have the}} {{documentary}} photograph, radical enough in its context, the social document, a large slice of Sydney's evolution and an example to all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>think</b> <b>of</b> future generations in terms of historical narration." [...] Max Dupain ...|$|R
