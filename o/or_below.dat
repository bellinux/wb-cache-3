5|$|By 1850, {{most of the}} surface-lying gum {{had been}} picked up, and people began digging for it. The hillsides yielded shallow-buried gum (about 1m), but in the swamps and beaches, it was buried much further down (4m <b>or</b> <b>below).</b>|$|E

Development of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008 leading to the opening of Raptor at Gardaland, the world's first Wing Coaster, on 1 April 2011.

5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, little of the planet has been explored; {{in addition to the}} fact that life as currently understood may not necessarily be the same {{in other parts of the}} universe, the extent of the tenacity of life on Earth itself has not yet been shown. Creatures known as extremophiles exist on Earth, preferring extreme habitats. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive at temperatures reaching above the boiling point of water, acidophiles thrive at a pH level of 3 <b>or</b> <b>below,</b> polyextremophiles can survive a varied number of extreme conditions, and many other types of extremophiles exist on Earth.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, England's {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a 32‚Äì22 loss to New Zealand at the semi-final stage. England responded to their exit from the tournament by replacing a number of veterans with younger players for the 2009 Four Nations. Tomkins, who was then playing at stand-off for Wigan, was included in a new-look squad which featured {{a quarter of its}} players aged 21 <b>or</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible.

5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) <b>or</b> <b>below</b> (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|E
5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10‚àí26 to 10‚àí27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E

5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{distinctive}} vestment of metropolitan archbishops, {{and may be}} found in their bearings as well as the corporate arms of archdioceses, displayed either above <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the shield.

Since then, it has increased, nearly doubling to over 23,000 in 1991. In the 2011 census, {{the population was}} 26,203, comprising 11,863 (48.4%) males and 12,647 (51.6%) females. 7,674 (31.3%) residents were aged 16 <b>or</b> <b>below,</b> 13,150 (63.3%) between 16 and 65, and 3,686 (15.0%) aged 65 or over.|$|E
