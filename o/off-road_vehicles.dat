5|$|In March 2003 Volkswagen do Brasil {{launched}} in the market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. GM do Brasil followed three months later with the Chevrolet Corsa 1.8 Flexpower, using an engine developed by a joint-venture with Fiat called PowerTrain. Passenger flex-fuel vehicles became a commercial success in the country, and , a total of 15 car manufacturers produce flex-fuel engines for the Brazilian market, dominating all light vehicle segments except sports cars, <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> and minivans.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the over}} 3400 species of frog and toad worldwide, the {{majority}} {{live in the}} tropics. However, Michigan's species live where it is often cold, necessitating adaptions to freezing weather due to their ectothermic (cold-blooded) nature. Most frogs and toads become dormant in the winter; some frogs can withstand short periods of freezing conditions, {{but this is not}} true of all species. Some species of salamander also hibernate during the winter, while other fully aquatic species remain active throughout the year. Amphibians are vulnerable to many types of human encroachment, including water pollution, automobiles, the destruction of wetlands through farming and the use of <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> and chemical pesticides. In Michigan, wetlands protection legislation is in place to prevent pollution and destruction, while additional wetlands are being reclaimed and restored after agricultural usage has ceased.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated {{that there are only}} a few thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring for over a century following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as 4Ã—4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
25|$|Human {{recreational}} activities, such as <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> near wetlands, {{are also}} damaging its habitat. Lakes and streams are enjoyable areas for recreation, but human activity {{in these areas}} can degrade them. The use of <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in or around wetlands, however, is the most damaging recreational activity. Mud bogging significantly damages and destroys these areas. Also, oil and gasoline from <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{has been found in}} snake habitats.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSet up {{the dynamic}} model of light <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle,</b> {{including}} body dynamics model, wheel model, engine model, and so on.

Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation model of the ESP control system for the Beijing JEEP 2500 light <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Using the simulation model, we respectively simulate and analyse the vehicle performance of low engine throttle opening control, ASR control and ESP control when the vehicle straight runs and turns on the bisectional road.

25|$|Erosion : Hill-walking and use {{of other}} public {{rights-of-way}} is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use {{of the most popular}} paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by horse riding on unsurfaced bridleways, mountain biking {{and use of}} <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> on green lanes. Examples include Dovedale in the Peak District. Over-grazing, for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.|$|E
