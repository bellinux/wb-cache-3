40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to solve the problem {{connected}} with development of theoretical and methodological provisions of formation of the assessment procedure of organizational resources <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity. Theoretical results of our research are: improvement of the concept of development of organizational resources <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity; identifying the impact of organizational resources on the <b>productive</b> activity; justification <b>of</b> the basic principles of formation of the assessment system of efficiency of the organizational resources' use. We proposed a unified methodological approach allowing to combine the complexity of assessment of both quantity of core resources <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity and organizational resources, which significantly develops traditional systems <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity management based on identifying quantitative parameters of the subsystems, their assessment, comparison and analysis. We also substantiated our opinion on assessment of organizational resources' values. It is focused on the development <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity and allows to use the developed tools of the methodological approach for forecast assessment of the impact of the quantity of core resources, used in the productive activity, and organizational resources <b>of</b> the <b>productive</b> activity on the economic results of the enterprise...|$|R

5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people <b>of</b> <b>productive</b> age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI {{is more common in}} young people, its costs to society are high due to the loss <b>of</b> <b>productive</b> years to death and disability. The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number <b>of</b> <b>productive</b> observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E
