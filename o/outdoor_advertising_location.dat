Chief among its work from this period are the block-long news and stock tickers on Morgan Stanley’s headquarters on Broadway, and the 1992 north-Square Coca-Cola display, which featured state-of-the-art digital technology.

40|$|The <b>outdoor</b> <b>{{advertising}}</b> the {{forerunner of}} modern advertising media is brimming with opportunities. There is a misconception {{in the minds of}} advertisers that <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is subordinate to other major advertising media and thus is regarded as ‘reminder medium’ and they put forth the argument that <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is indicated only for products in competitive stage and is of no use for products in pioneering stage. It is high time the advertisers treat the <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> on par with other advertising media. Introduction: When the first outdoor signs walked into the Indian advertising field, everyone thought that it would revolutionise the advertising world. Surprisingly, nothing of that sort happened. Even today, we have many people who hardly consider outdoor signs as good advertisements. We have not taken <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> seriously. The potential of <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is not satisfactorily explored. The influence of <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising,</b> if properly used, is immense. It acts as a stopper. It enables the passerby to pause for a while {{to have a look at}} the display. Outdoor sign can sell the advertiser’s message with telling effect. Outdoor medium has an edge over other advertising media in that it commands vast potential audience. Since outdoor sign is mostly erected in public frequented places it has got the added 1 advantage of capturing the attention of both literates and illiterates and people of all age groups. It is unwise to insist upon the traditional character of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> as only a ‘reminder’. There is a misconception in the minds of advertisers that <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is subordinate to other major advertising media and thus is regarded as ‘reminder medium’ and they put forth the argument that <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is indicated only for products in competitive stage and is of no use for products in pioneering stage. But <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> is something more than that. Poor taste and abuse have reduced the <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> to lose public credibility...|$|R

40|$|Targeted {{advertising}} {{is a key}} characteristic of online as well as traditional-media marketing. However it is very limited in <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising,</b> that is, performing campaigns by means of billboards in public places. The reason {{is the lack of}} information about the interests of the particular passersby, except at very imprecise and aggregate demographic or traffic estimates. In this work we propose a methodology for performing targeted <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> by leveraging the use of social media. In particular, we use the Twitter social network to gather information about users’ degree of interest in given advertising categories and about the common routes that they follow, characterizing in this way each zone in a given city. Then we use our characterization for recommending physical <b>locations</b> for <b>advertising.</b> Given an advertisement category, we estimate the most promising areas to be selected for the placement of an ad that can maximize its targeted effectiveness. We show that our approach is able to select <b>advertising</b> <b>locations</b> better with respect to a baseline reflecting a current ad-placement policy. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first work on offline advertising in urban areas making use of (publicly available) data from social networks...|$|R

Using a qualitative semi-structured interview approach, data were collected from 15 respondents representing government departments, advertising agencies and media owners. Findings included aesthetic banning of sky signs and freestanding billboards, controlled reintroduction of freestanding advertisements, the advertising community collaboratively pushing the envelope of creativity, and government departments conditionally meeting the creativity need of the advertising community.

40|$|Advertising is {{recognised}} to be {{an essential}} service in today's world. Amongst other things, it serves to keep consumers informed of services and goods available and locations where they may be bought. However, <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> signs can be visually unappealing and as such denigrated {{by members of the}} public. Yet while advertising of any kind is justifiably condemned in a wilderness landscape - a 'natural' landscape where it is incongruous - {{that is not to say}} that it must be outlawed everywhere. In the shopping centre, entertainment area, commercial area, advertising can be justified - it is appropriate there and is all part of the feeling of "place". The problem remains, however, of integrating advertising signs to the townscape. The goal of this study is to investigate the proposition that <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising</b> can be a positive feature in the townscape. To attain this goal, five objectives are identified. The first is to review the literature on <b>outdoor</b> <b>advertising.</b> This serves to provide an overall context for the present study.
