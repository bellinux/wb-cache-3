5|$|On the October 8 {{episode of}} Raw, the Hardy Boyz won the WCW Tag Team Championship from Booker T and Test. They lost the {{title to the}} Dudley Boyz two weeks later. On the November 12 episode of Raw, they beat Booker T and Test again, but this time for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, they lost the title to the Dudleys in a Steel Cage title {{unification}} match. This defeat led to a break up storyline {{that resulted in a}} match between the brothers at Vengeance. Jeff Hardy would emerge victorious after Lita, who was the special referee, failed to see Matt Hardy's foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The storyline was dropped in January 2002 and the Hardy Boyz reunited.|$|E
5|$|The second {{featured}} bout on the undercard was {{a standard}} {{match for the}} WWE United States Championship between Eddie Guerrero, and The Big Show. Guerrero {{used a variety of}} tactics including forcing Big Show's head into an exposed turnbuckle, striking him with a trash can lid, punching him with brass knuckles and striking him with the title belt. After hitting Show with the belt, Guerrero performed a frog splash for a near-fall. Show then performed a chokeslam but Guerrero placed his foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Show then performed another chokeslam on Guerrero to win the title.|$|E
5|$|In late 2001, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline {{in which}} they were feuding with one another. Lita {{refereed}} a match between them at Vengeance on December 9. Jeff won the match with a scripted finish that had Lita failing to notice that Matt had placed his leg <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> during Jeff's successful pin attempt. Continuing the storyline on the following episode of Raw, Matt defeated Lita and Jeff in a handicap match, shortly after informing Lita that both their relationship and the Hardy Boyz were finished. On the December 17 episode of Raw, both Jeff and Lita were sidelined with storyline injuries following a title match between Jeff and WWF Hardcore Champion The Undertaker. The injuring of both his brother and ex-girlfriend led to a reconciliation between the members of Team Xtreme, and on the December 20 episode of SmackDown!, Matt faced The Undertaker but was also injured. All three members of Team Xtreme were then removed from WWF television for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2016 WWE draft which took place on 19 July, Lynch made her first {{appearance}} for the brand on 26 July, defeating Natalya before being confronted by the brand female talents. On the 16 August episode of SmackDown Live, Lynch teamed with Carmella in a successful victory against Alexa Bliss and Natalya, after a distraction provided by Eva Marie and Naomi. It was later announced a six-woman tag team match for SummerSlam between Lynch, Carmella and Naomi against Bliss, Marie and Natalya, but following Marie's suspension on 18 August, her place was taken by the returning Nikki Bella, and Lynch's team would ultimately lose the match at evet on 21 August. At Backlash on 11 September, Lynch won a six-pack elimination challenge by last eliminating Carmella to become the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, marking her first title victory in WWE. Lynch's first title defense against Alexa Bliss was scheduled for No Mercy on 9 October, but the match was postponed due to Lynch suffering a legitimate out-of-ring injury. The match was rescheduled for the 8 November episode of SmackDown Live, where Lynch successfully defended the title, albeit in controversial fashion (the referee did not see Bliss' foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> when she submitted to her finishing maneuver, the Dis-arm-her). Lynch was a part of Team SmackDown at Survivor Series on 20 November, where she was the last woman from the team to be eliminated during the traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match.|$|E

5|$|On the July 25 {{episode of}} Raw, Mysterio won the tournament {{to become the}} new WWE Champion, and {{immediately}} had to fend off Alberto Del Rio {{to prevent him from}} cashing in his Money in the Bank. TripleH, now Chief Operating Officer, decreed that Mysterio was to face ex-champion Cena later that night for the title; Cena won and again became WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena. Cena and Punk later fought in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won controversially as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> and it was actually a rope break. As Punk celebrated, Kevin Nash made his WWE return and assaulted him. Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head. Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011; starting a 434-day reign until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble event.|$|E

25|$|Survival for sponges farmed on ropes is {{generally}} lower as unrecoverable damage occurs to the explant when ‘threading’ onto the rope takes place. Furthermore, sponges cultured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{have the potential}} to be torn off the rope during storms as water flow increases significantly, or grow away from the rope and form an unmarketable, low value, characteristic doughnut shaped sponge. Differences in sponge growth and health do occur within species characterised by variations in regenerative ability, susceptibility to infection after cutting, hardiness and growth potential.|$|E
25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E

25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to pull on a rope, that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to pull <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and were all <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who was in front of him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing {{over the edge of the}} precipice.|$|E

25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first, going less than five an over {{for most of the}} innings. However some late hitting by Nathan Astle, who {{finished}} on 118 not out and hit three sixes off the last three balls of the innings, got New Zealand to 276-6. Ian Bradshaw was the pick of the West Indian bowlers, with 3-41 off 8 overs. In the West Indies innings, Chris Gayle scored a 23 ball 38, putting the run rate above 6 an over. However Daniel Vettori brought the Kiwis back into the game with two wickets in one over. Later on, Astle backed up his batting effort with a one handed catch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The West Indies finished all {{out at the end of}} 49 overs. Astle was named Man of the Match for the second time in three matches. New Zealand have now won the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Lex Luger and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Luger gained the early advantage, and {{targeted}} {{the left arm}} of Flair. Luger applied the hammerlock, and used the guard rail and ringpost. Flair fought back after he avoided an elbow drop, and sent Luger's head into the guard rail. Luger applied the sleeper hold, but Flair fought out with a belly to back suplex. Luger fought back with a superplex, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger continued to have the advantage until Flair pulled Luger down, and hit his left knee with a steel chair. Flair then targeted Luger's left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger fought back with a gorilla press slam. After performing mounted punches and a scoop powerslam, Luger applied the Torture Rack. However, his knees buckled, and Flair fell on top of him. Flair then pinned Luger with his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E
