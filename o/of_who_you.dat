Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're ready {{to let go of the}} past, embrace change and become more <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes Lander {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} Spit : [...] "People expect us to suck, then we get on stage and blow them away."

According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, giving you a hard time because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many people think that the album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E

Her awards have included an honorary Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, and an honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival. The Los Angeles Times Magazine, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or even my body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength. Otherwise, you’ll lose your idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. Every film I make entails becoming a different woman. And in front of a camera, no less!

500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} season a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews—of 81, signifying [...] "universal acclaim".

He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star," [...] and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being [...] "just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions".|$|E

500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Beautiful" [...] {{was directed by}} Jonas Åkerlund and premiered on December 9, 2002. It opens with Aguilera speaking the line [...] "Don't look at me", followed by scenes of her singing alone in a room intercut with self-image-related sequences of other people. An anorexic girl examines herself in a mirror, eventually punching through it; a thin teenage boy stands lifting weights in a room plastered with images of bodybuilders; and an African-American girl rips out pages of women's magazines including photos of only white women and throws them into a fire. In one sequence, a girl is physically bullied by several peers, and in another, a goth man sits {{at the back of}} a bus while several people get up and move. The video also touches on LGBT issues; one scene features a gay couple, portrayed by Jordan Shannon and Justin Croft, kissing on a bench and ignoring the stares of people who pass them. Another shows a transgender person, played by Robert Sherman, putting on makeup, a wig, and women's clothing. The music video debuted at number 2 on Total Request Live, spending a total of fifty days on the chart and retiring at number 6. It topped MuchMusic's Countdown for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for fifteen weeks. The video received a Special Recognition award, presented by David LaChapelle, from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation at its 14th GLAAD Media Awards. After an a cappella performance of the song, Aguilera stated in her acceptance speech that [...] "this song is definitely a universal message that everybody can relate to– anyone that's been discriminated against or unaccepted, unappreciated or disrespected just because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E

500|$|Although not a ratings success, {{the series}} was a {{critical}} success from its first season. Robert Abele of LA Weekly said [...] "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way that}} stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." [...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star", and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are."

So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world.
