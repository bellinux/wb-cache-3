5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and <b>our</b> <b>dependence</b> on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E
25|$|The {{impending}} {{depletion of}} natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Interestingly enough, shifting <b>our</b> <b>dependence</b> on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).|$|E
25|$|In Shusterman’s and, also, Dewey's opinion, {{the eastern}} {{meditation}} practices repair perception for understanding <b>our</b> <b>dependence</b> on the society’s moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s {{critique of the}} myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation {{has been one of the}} reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we propose}} a new term {{dependence}} model for information retrieval, {{which is based}} on a theoretical framework using Markov random fields. We assume two types of dependencies of terms given in a query: (i) long-range dependencies that may appear for instance within a passage or a sentence in a target document, and (ii) short-range dependencies that may appear for instance within a compound word in a target document. Based on this assumption, <b>our</b> two-stage term <b>dependence</b> model captures both long-range and short-range term dependencies differently, when more than one compound word appear in a query. We also investigate how query structuring with term dependence can improve the performance of query expansion using a relevance model. The relevance model is constructed using the retrieval results of the structured query with term dependence to expand the query. We show that <b>our</b> term <b>dependence</b> model works well, particularly when using query structuring with compound words, through experiments using a 100 -gigabyte test collection of web documents mostly written in Japanese. We also show that the performance of the relevance model can be significantly improved by using the structured query with <b>our</b> term <b>dependence</b> model...|$|R

The most significant limitation is that, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds of these phyla have never been found as fossils, because most animal species are soft-bodied and decay before they can become fossilized.|$|E

40|$|A strong intuition for AGM belief change operations, Gärdenfors suggests, is that {{formulas}} {{that are}} independent of a change should remain intact. Based on this intuition, Farias and Herzig axiomatize a dependence relation w. r. t. a belief set, and formalize the connection between dependence and belief change. In this paper, we introduce base depen-dence as a relation between formulas w. r. t. a belief base. After an axiomatization of base dependence, we formalize the con-nection between base dependence and a particular belief base change operation, saturated kernel contraction. Moreover, we prove that base dependence is a reversible generalization of Farias and Herzig’s dependence. That is, in the special case when the underlying belief base is deductively closed (i. e., it is a belief set), base dependence reduces to dependence. Finally, an intriguing feature of Farias and Herzig’s formalism is that it meets other criteria for dependence, namely, Keynes’ conjunction criterion for dependence (CCD) and Grdenfors’ conjunction criterion for independence (CCI). We show that <b>our</b> base <b>dependence</b> formalism also meets these criteria. More interestingly, we offer a more specific criterion that implies both CCD and CCI, and show <b>our</b> base <b>dependence</b> formalism also meets this new criterion...|$|R
