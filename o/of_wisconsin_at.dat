500|$|In March 1979, {{the editors}} sent a final draft to the DOE for comment. DOE officials, first in {{phone calls and}} then in person, {{attempted}} to dissuade The Progressive from publishing the article {{on the grounds that}} it contained [...] "secret restricted data" [...] as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The Progressives editors were not persuaded, and told the officials that they intended to proceed with publishing Morland's article. The DOE filed a motion to suppress the article with the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in Madison on March 8, 1979. There was only one judge in the Western District <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> <b>at</b> the time, Judge James Doyle, but he recused himself as a friend of the magazine. The case was therefore brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and heard by Warren in Milwaukee.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 Littleton once again {{traveled}} to Europe, this time to research how glass was taught in universities there. He found nothing that he could bring back to the U.S. to help him educate art students at the University <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin.</b> <b>At</b> that time, European glass programs were geared solely toward industrial production. Students were not taught hands-on techniques with the material; the craft of working with hot glass was still taught at the factories, under the apprenticeship system. What Littleton did find in Europe was a kindred spirit in glass art, the German Erwin Eisch, who is recognized today as a founder of European studio glass. [...] Eisch {{had set up a}} small work area in his family’s glass factory in Frauenau for the production of his own glass art. [...] Trained as a fine artist in the academies of Germany, he was largely self-taught as a glass blower and at the time produced his work {{with the help of the}} factory’s craftsmen. The friendship begun when Littleton visited Eisch in Frauenau in 1962 lasted for the rest of Littleton’s life, and had profound influence on the work of each. [...] The two spent some of almost every summer together for the next thirty years.|$|E
