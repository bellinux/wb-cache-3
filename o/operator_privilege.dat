50|$|Additionally, a newer {{protection}} involving timestamping is {{used when}} a server splits {{away from the}} main network (when it no longer detects that IRC services are available), it disallows anyone creating a channel to be given <b>operator</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|K-lines can {{be given}} due to {{inappropriate}} behavior {{on the part of}} the user, such as nickname colliding, mode [...] "hacking", multiple channel flooding, harassing other users via private messaging features, spamming etc., or in the case of older networks without timestamping, split riding, which cannot be corrected through use of channel <b>operator</b> <b>privileges</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|ChanServ, on many IRC networks, is an IRC service which {{maintains}} channel {{registration and}} access information. If a channel is registered with ChanServ, its owners (and those they have designated) can use ChanServ to obtain {{control over the}} channel, gaining channel <b>operator</b> <b>privileges.</b> Most channel service bots also allow other sorts of channel management options, such as topic locks (in addition to +t), mode locks, and providing users automatically with operator status, half-operator status, voice, or other access, as designated by the channel owners. They may also provide some form of automated ban-list management.|$|R

25|$|The 13cm band {{is shared}} with Part 15 users {{as well as}} the Federal {{radiolocation}} service, and ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) devices. Amateur radio <b>operators</b> have secondary <b>privileges</b> to the Federal radiolocation service in the entire band and may not cause interference to these users. Amateur radio <b>operators</b> have primary <b>privileges</b> to ISM devices from 2.390–2.417GHz and secondary privileges from 2.417–2.450GHz. Because of the high number of Part 15 users, the noise level in this band tends to be rather high.|$|R
25|$|The Advanced Class <b>operator</b> license, whose <b>privileges</b> closely {{match those}} of the General class license but {{included}} 275kHz of additional spectrum in the HF bands, was deprecated by the restructuring in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Another {{security}} mechanism is that code files {{can only be}} created by trusted compilers. Malicious programmers cannot create a program {{and call it a}} compiler - a program could only be converted to be a compiler by an <b>operator</b> with sufficient <b>privileges</b> with the 'mc' make compiler operator command.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} limit 2- or 1-letter suffixes to <b>operators</b> {{with advanced}} <b>privileges</b> (e.g. The Republic of Georgia limits one-letter suffixes to “extra” class licenses). As noted above, beginning in 1977 this was generally {{the practice in}} the United States, and many operators holding the highest class license took 2x1 or 1x2 calls.|$|R
50|$|As one of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} tools for managing the Mongol Empire, the operation of the Yam system was regulated by the written law Yassa. Both messengers and station <b>operators</b> enjoyed extended <b>privileges.</b> Even for everybody else, the requirements of the Yam took precedence before their other duties and interests, and they had to support it whenever it became necessary. This kind of support was made possible by the strict discipline within the empire, which also led to a high level of security, often described as Pax Mongolica.|$|R
2500|$|The 5cm band {{is shared}} with the fixed-satellite service in ITU Region 1, and the {{radiolocation}} service. In ITU Region 2 (US) the primary user is military radiolocation, specifically naval radar. Amateur radio <b>operators</b> have secondary <b>privileges</b> to the Federal radiolocation service in the entire band and may not cause interference to these users. Amateur operators are allocated this band are in a co-secondary basis with ISM devices and space research. Amateur, space research, and ISM operators each have the [...] "right to operate". Due {{to the lack of}} a high number of Part 15 users (compared to 2.4GHz), the noise level tends to be lower {{in many parts of the}} US but can be quite congested in urban centers and on mountaintops.|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this project is to show the {{analyses}} of unauthorized subscriptions electricity consumption and provide the option of distribution networks screening on-line through istalment the devices providing remote control. This way of elimination the causes of unauthorized consumption has been not commonly used in the Czech Republic yet, it is pre-pilot project. We should be announced about the ways of measuring the electricity consumption used in past and nowadays. At present, {{there is a significant}} increase in case of unauthorized donations of electricity. Operators of distribution networks pay increased attention to these issues and develop efforts to reduce non-technical losses in the distribution and trade in electricity, which in its consequences lead to increase in costs with an impact in electricity prices. On business conditions and performance of government in the energy sectors and amendment of some laws the definition of certain terms of irregular donation electricity characterized by the provision of energy bill, which is a precondition for their qualifications. The analyses of unauthorized consumption based on on-line measuring with tending to make it easier and cheaper is useful for future, of course it might substitute the pretty expensive ways of measuring actual energy consumption. The result of it should by presentation of numeric energy flux diagram. There is a growing frequency and social insecurity of unauthorized of electricity and it is primarily on the distribution system <b>operator,</b> consistently <b>privileges</b> resulting from the energy bill and other generally binding regulations. The system lead to revealing unjustified interference with measuring equipment for which data on consumption are registered or recorded incorrectly or other useful functions...|$|R
