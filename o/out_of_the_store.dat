[...] Bruce knew Peter White's father Stephen, and apparently did not know that the Carp River settlement was growing moribund as its forge failed, and so appointed Peter White as the new postmaster of Carp River. [...] White ran the Carp River post office <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> he clerked at, which was indeed next door to the house of the Marquette postmaster. Because White's store was more convenient, more citizens began sending mail through the Carp River post office than the next-door Marquette post office, and the postal service, whose officials were in far-away Washington, D.C., soon closed the Marquette office. [...] After some time, White formally changed the name of his post office to [...] "Marquette," [...] and he continued as the town's postmaster for a total of 12 years.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1998, the Arvizo {{family was}} {{detained}} on a shoplifting charge at a J. C. Penney department store in West Covina, California. According to J.C.

In her booking photo from the arrest she appears uninjured, but for the lawsuit she submitted two pictures showing bruises all over her body. The paralegal she hired would later testify at the Jackson trial that Janet told her the beating was actually inflicted by her husband. J.C. Penney hired a psychiatrist to evaluate Janet Arvizo and found her to have rehearsed her children into supporting her story and to be both [...] "delusional" [...] and [...] "depressed," [...] although Janet's own doctor found her to be only the latter. More than two years after the original alleged incident, Janet added a further charge that one of the male officers had [...] "sexually fondled" [...] her breasts and pelvis area for [...] "up to seven minutes," [...] a claim which shocked even her lawyer. Ultimately the department store settled out of court with the family for $152,000.|$|E

One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray and dark blue or black trousers.
