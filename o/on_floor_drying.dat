5|$|The {{geography}} in {{the area}} affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located.

The sandy ground <b>on</b> the valley <b>floor</b> <b>dries</b> up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining boulder clay.

50|$|The cistern {{was then}} drained and the grain {{transferred}} to another vessel called a couch, either a permanent construction, or temporarily formed with wooden boards. Here it was piled 12 - 16 in deep, and began to generate heat and start to germinate. It spent {{a day or two}} here, according to the season and the maltster's practice. It was then spread out <b>on</b> the growing <b>floor,</b> the depth dictated by the temperature, but sufficiently deep to encourage vegetation. It was turned at intervals to achieve even growth and over the next fourteen days or so it is turned and moved towards the kiln. The temperature was also controlled by ventilation. A day or two after the grain was turned out <b>on</b> to the <b>floor,</b> an agreeable smell was given off, and roots soon began to appear. A day or so later the future stem began to swell, and the kernel became friable and sweet-tasting. As the germination proceeded the grain was spread thinner <b>on</b> the <b>floor.</b> The process was halted before the stem burst the husk. At this stage much of the starch in the grain had been converted to maltose and the grain was left <b>on</b> the <b>floor</b> to <b>dry.</b> The art of malting depends on the proper regulation of these changes in the grain. Maltsters varied in their manner of working, and adapted to changes in climatic conditions.|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands at seven dieback sites in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn. ex Smith) forest of Western Australia {{was determined by the}} following two baiting techniques: in situ baiting with live Banksia grandis Willd. seedlings and ex situ baiting of sampled soil and root material. Four areas within each site were sampled, reflecting dieback age and position in the landscape. Approximate dieback ages of 50, 20 and 5 years were determined by aerial photography. The 50 -year-old age class was divided into wet valley <b>floor</b> and <b>dry</b> gravelly slope. Phytophthora cinnamomi was recovered most frequently from the 5 -year-old (dieback fronts) and wet 50 -year-old areas by both baiting techniques. It was recovered from {{more than twice as many}} areas and about five times as many samples when in situ B. grandis baits were used compared with ex situ soil and root baiting. Almost all recoveries from in situ baits were made between October and December. From both methods, it appears that P cinnamomi has a patchy distribution within dieback sites in the northern jarrah forest. It is easily detected only on dieback fronts and wet valley <b>floors.</b> <b>On</b> <b>dry</b> gravelly sites affected 20 years or more ago, P. cinnamomi is rare and may even be absent at some sites. This makes confident detection of the pathogen difficult. In situ baiting at least allows a temporal component to the sampling and will be a useful method of detection in areas where P. cinnamomi is rare or transient...|$|R

These consist of OC 1 /Residence, an apparent-ly aristocratic household, the furnishings of which attest to the wealth of its inhabitants, OC 2 /Workshop, a large and ornately decorated multifunctional workshop, and OC 3 /Tripartite, a building whose tripartite interior division conforms to what we might expect of a religious structure of the Etruscan seventh century.

50|$|The corn mill handled mainly {{oats and}} barley grown locally {{as well as}} {{imported}} maize. The mill is a three-storey building and all the apparatus of the mill, stone, sieves, bucket elevators, fans and a sack hoist are powered by a 7.63-metre (25 ft) waterwheel manufactured by J.Stevenson's Strabane Foundry in 1867. The waterwheel turned at three revolutions a minute generating eight horsepower which was transferred from the waterwheel to the mill apparatus by means of gearing and belting. The building also housed a kiln for drying the grain. Harry Pinkerton from Raphoe, the miller at Newmills for some years after the Second World War, stated that the mill was in operation nearly all year round. From the harvest in late summer right up to April or May the following year the mill was engaged in grinding the locally grown grains. During the summer months, animal-feed was prepared, usually by mixing maize with oats.The first processing of the grain that had been delivered by the farmer to the mill was to dry it. The grain was spread {{to a depth of}} around 15 cm (6ins) <b>on</b> the <b>drying</b> <b>floor,</b> made up of perforated metal plates <b>on</b> the ground <b>floor.</b> These were heated by the kiln <b>on</b> the lowerground <b>floor,</b> which was fired with a mulled coal, a smokeless fuel, somewhat like anthracite. Turf was not used as it gave the oats an unpleasant flavour. The kiln could dry two tonnes of oats a day, but this could be increased to another half tonne by putting on a load over night.|$|R
