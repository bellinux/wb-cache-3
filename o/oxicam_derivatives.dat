40|$|Toxic {{epidermal}} Necrolysis (TEN) {{are serious}} disorders commonly termed as idiosyncratic reactions to drug, {{the most common}} being antiepileptic(phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine and lamotrigine), sulfonamides, trimethoprim, ampicillin, allopurinol and NSAIDS (especially phenylbutazone and <b>oxicam</b> <b>derivatives).</b> Here we report a case of TEN in a patient who developed the lesion after oral administration of ACECLOFENAC. These drugs have rarely been implicated in this disorder. The suspected drug {{in this case was}} aceclofenac. The patient was managed with antibiotics, corticosteroids and parenteral fluids and recovered well...|$|E
40|$|Stevens Johnson’s {{syndrome}} {{is a life}} threatening drug induced hypersensitivity reaction. The drugs that cause SJS commonly are antibacterials (sulfonamides), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<b>oxicam</b> <b>derivatives)</b> and oxide inhibitors (allopurinol). Clinical symptoms are urticarial skin eruptions, arthralgia or arthritis, lymphadenopathy and fever. Treatment of Stevens Johnsons Syndrome includes systemic steroids, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin’s and supportive therapy. A male patient of 58 years was admitted in cardiology unit with chief complaints of skin reactions (Erythema andrashes) all over the body and oral erosions. The patient was diagnosed to have drug induced stevens Johnson’s syndromeandthe suspected drug was amoxicillin potassium clavulanate. By using Naranjo scale and WHO-UMC scale it {{was found to be}} a probable ADR and it was managed by drug dechallenge, dexamethasone, dew on ultra-lotion, diprovate ointment. During treatment patientdeveloped severe breathlessness and died. Hence there is a need of clinical pharmacy services to detect, manage and prevent adverse drug reactions.

40|$|Meloxicam (MEL) is an <b>oxicam</b> <b>derivative</b> and {{a member}} of the enolic acid group of non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs). Most of the reported methods for HPLC analysis of Meloxicam are cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive. Reverse phase chromatographic analysis was performed on a C 18 Hi Q Sil column with methanol–waterorthophosphoric acid (80 : 19. 9 : 0. 1 % v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detection wavelength of 360 nm. System suitability tests essential for the assurance of quality performance of the method were performed. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, specificity and robustness, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). A single sharp peak was obtained for MEL at Rt of 4. 38 ± 0. 02 min. The polynomial regression data for the calibration plots exhibited linear relationship (r...|$|R
