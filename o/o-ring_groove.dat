These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the <b>O-ring</b> <b>groove</b> in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and <b>O-ring</b> <b>groove.</b> The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of the stainless steel feedthrough box for the CC cryostat resulted in distortion of the slotted plates through which the circuit boards must be installed. Due to the <b>o-ring</b> <b>grooves</b> in the plates {{and the presence of}} small pump out passages it is difficult to machine the surface flat after installation. Installing the boards on the distorted surface requires distorting the g- 10 flange and the board which is glued to it to match the surface distortion and achieve a seal. This results in stresses for which the epoxy bond may not be adequate. The purpose of this work is to estimate the shear and normal stresses in the two critical planes between the board and flange and evaluate epoxy joint performance...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{inspection system}} has been developed to inspect the o-ring sealing surfaces on the Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM) case segment joints. A laser digitizing system is {{used to create a}} three dimensional map of the o-ring sealing surfaces. This data is analyzed for any irregularities, which are noted for further inspection and disposition. This paper describes both the hardware and the software used to gather data as well as the methods developed to analyze the data. The RSRM is assembled from four casting segments. Each of the field joints between these segments is sealed with three o-rings. These o-rings are critical for the proper operation of the motor. After launch the booster segments are recovered and reused. As part of the refurbishment process the o-ring sealing surfaces are inspected for any irregularities. The system developed uses a combination of commercial and customized hardware and software. The system uses two computer systems in a real time environment to control a laser, an XYZ precision table, and case rotation and position information. The system is capable of inspecting both the tang end and the clevis end of the RSRM field joint. The <b>o-ring</b> <b>grooves</b> and flat sealing surfaces are inspected...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{vessels are}} a {{commonly}} used device in marine engineering. Until recently the primary analysis method had been hand calculations and empirical curves. New computer advances have made {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) a practical tool {{in the study of}} pressure vessels, especially in determining stresses in local areas such as penetrations, <b>O-ring</b> <b>grooves</b> and other areas difficult to analyze by hand. This project set out to explore applicable methods using finite element analysis in pressure vessel analysis. Having tested three dimensional, symmetric and axisymmetric models, the preliminary conclusion is that finite element analysis is an extremely powerful tool when employed correctly. Depending on the desired solutions, there are different methods that offer faster run times and less error. The two recommended methods included symmetric models using shell elements and axisymmetric models using solid elements. Contact elements were tested to determine their usefulness in modeling the interaction between pressure vessel cylinder walls and end caps. When modeled correctly, contact elements proved to be useful, but the operator also {{needs to be able to}} interpret the results properly. Problems such as local stress risers, unrealistic displacements and understanding how to use such data become extremely important in this kind of analysis. This highlights the key to proper use of finite element analysis. The analyst should be able to approximate the solution using classical methodology (hand calculations) in order to verify the solution...|$|R

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an <b>o-ring</b> in a <b>groove</b> machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two <b>O-rings</b> in <b>grooves</b> around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R

Examination showed that in both the O-rings, loss of material occurred by wear {{over a period of}} time. The wear pattern and the morphology of the worn out surface indicated that there was looseness in the O-rings which resulted in improper seating of the <b>O-rings</b> on the <b>groove.</b> Because of this, during motion of the piston, a sector of the rings had undesirable contact with the moving surfaces leading to accelerated wear on a sector of the rings. Analysis suggests that the failure was facilitated due to oversize of the O-rings and/or undersize of the groove on the piston.

A Variation of this was to either have an o-ring installed or absent on the drill rod that was grooved on the pin. A series of tests were run with both the o-ring grooved Longyear drill rod and the plain pin end rod manufactured by Diamond Drill.

25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an <b>O-ring</b> in a <b>groove</b> in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to propose a {{one-time}} exigent change to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES) Unit 2 Technical Specifications to reflect enforcement discretion granted by the NRC on April 8, 2000 at 1430 hours. The proposed change will allow Unit 2 operation to continue until an outage occurs where leak rate surveillance testing on spectacle flanges 2 S 299 A and 2 S 299 B can be performed. Background The RHR relief valve discharge line penetrations provide the relief path from the RHR Heat Exchanger (shell side) to the suppression pool. This penetration was originally also intended to provide the flowpath for the RHR steam condensing mode, which {{was removed from the}} plant design prior to initial plant operation. During closeout of the Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) outage activities on the Unit 1 RHR relief valve line spectacle flange (1 $ 299 B), plant personnel questioned whether the design requires two or three o-rings per spectacle flange face. The spectacle flange on each face contains three grooves.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large diameter flanges for the supply of water in South Africa. These large diameter pipe flanges are required to accommodate pipes with nominal bores of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types of integral flange designs are considered, namely: flat face, raised face, and a modified raised face with an <b>O-ring</b> <b>groove.</b> The effects of creep-relaxation, flange rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the faces of the flange and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large diameter flanges. It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the sealing ability, circular bolted flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.

40|$|A high-strength, low-weight {{pressure}} vessel dome was {{designed specifically to}} house a high-pressure [2, 000 psi (approx. = 13. 8 MPa) ] electrolyzer. In operation, the dome is filled with an inert gas pressurized to roughly 100 psi (approx. = 690 kPa) above the high, balanced pressure product oxygen and hydrogen gas streams. The inert gas acts to reduce the clamping load on electrolyzer stack tie bolts since the dome pressure acting axially inward helps offset the outward axial forces from the stack gas pressure. Likewise, radial and circumferential stresses on electrolyzer frames are minimized. Because the dome is operated at a higher pressure than the electrolyzer product gas, any external electrolyzer leak prevents oxygen or hydrogen from leaking into the dome. Instead the affected stack gas stream pressure rises detectably, thereby enabling a system shutdown. All electrical and fluid connections to the stack are made inside the pressure dome and require special plumbing and electrical dome interfaces {{for this to be}} accomplished. Further benefits of the dome are that it can act as a containment shield in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure. Studies indicate that, for a given active area (and hence, cell ID), frame outside diameter must become ever larger to support stresses at higher operating pressures. This can lead to a large footprint and increased costs associated with thicker and/or larger diameter end-plates, tie-rods, and the frames themselves. One solution is to employ rings that fit snugly around the frame. This complicates stack assembly and is sometimes difficult to achieve in practice, as its success is strongly dependent on frame and ring tolerances, gas pressure, and operating temperature. A pressure dome permits an otherwise low-pressure stack to operate at higher pressures without growing the electrolyzer hardware. The pressure dome consists of two machined segments. An O-ring is placed in an <b>O-ring</b> <b>groove</b> in the flange of the bottom segment and is trapped by the flange on the top dome segment when these components are bolted together with high-strength bolts. The pressure dome has several unique features. It is made (to ASME Pressure Vessel guidelines) in a high-strength aluminum alloy with the strength of stainless steel and the weight benefits of aluminum. The flange of the upper dome portion contains specially machined flats for mounting the dome, and other flats dedicated to the special feedthroughs for electrical connections. A pressure dome can be increased in length to house larger stacks (more cells) of the same diameter with the simple addition of a cylindrical segment. To aid in dome assembly, two stainless steel rings are employed. One is used beneath the heads of the high-strength bolts in lieu of individual hardened washers, and another is used instead of individual nuts. Like electrolyzers could be operated at low or high pressures simply by operating the electrolyzer outside or inside a pressurized dome...|$|E
