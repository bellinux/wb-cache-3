5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated by the presence <b>of</b> <b>auto</b> production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker {{to compete with the}} Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make equity investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>auto</b> parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' equity either directly or via private equity funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total equity. IFC’s private equity portfolio currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The portfolio is widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. Other equity investments made by the IFC include preferred equity, convertible loans, and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering. When the IFC invests in a company, it does not assume an active role in management of the company.|$|E

5|$|Baseball is {{currently}} the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely {{considered to be the}} highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan {{has one of the most}} successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times. Also, Japan recently won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan, as are forms <b>of</b> <b>auto</b> racing like the Super GT series and Formula Nippon. The country has produced one NBA player, Yuta Tabuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, {{the state}} highway system was {{restructured}} completely, incorporating numbers instead of names. The Olympic Highway became State Road9, the Pacific Highway became State Road1, the National Park Highway absorbed the Naches Pass Highway and remained State Road5, and the Inland Empire Highway became State Road3, but its branch from Dayton to Clarkston remained {{a branch of}} the now non-existent Inland Empire Highway. A system of national highways that improved on the concept <b>of</b> <b>auto</b> trails was formed in late 1925. The final plan for the system—which became the U.S. routes—was approved on November11, 1926. One of the routes included in the plan was US410, which extended from US101 in Aberdeen to US95 in Lewiston, Idaho. Parts of US410 were concurrent with other new highways, including US99 from Olympia to Tacoma and US97 in Yakima. In 1937, the state highway system changed to a primary and secondary system. US410 remained the same, but its concurrent state highways had their designations changed by the state. State Road9 became Primary State Highway9 (PSH9), State Road1 and US99 became PSH1, State Road5 became PSH5, State Road3 became PSH3, and the Inland Empire Highway branch from Dayton to Clarkston became a branch of PSH3.|$|E
