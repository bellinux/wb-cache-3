5|$|The islands {{were under}} Muslim rule from 1348 to 1391. After the {{establishment}} of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1391, Muzaffar Shah I was appointed viceroy of north Konkan. For the administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> he appointed a governor for Mahim. During the reign of Ahmad Shah I (1411–1443), Malik-us-Sharq was appointed governor of Mahim, and in addition to instituting a proper survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> he improved the existing revenue system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> During the early 15th century, the Bhandaris seized the island of Mahim from the Sultanate and ruled it for eight years. It was reconquered by Rai Qutb of the Gujarat Sultanate. Firishta, a Persian historian, recorded that by 1429 the seat of government of the Gujarat Sultanate in north Konkan had transferred from Thane to Mahim. On Rai Qutb's death in 1429–1430, Ahmad Shah I Wali of the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan captured Salsette and Mahim.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months after the {{beginning}} of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the Harbour area with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support.

50|$|There are two road bridges {{that connect}} <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road network in Norway.

The islands were later organized into three encomiendas and were administered from Arevalo. De Loarca visited Romblon in 1582 and conducted the first census <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along its track, several {{hurricane}} {{warnings and}} watches were issued for the Leeward Islands; however, no damage was reported on any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> The storm has its greatest impact in Bermuda where high winds and near-record rainfall downed trees, {{power lines and}} caused flooding.

5|$|At the time, Tulagi was {{the capital}} of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, which {{included}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> of the Solomons except Bougainville and Buka.

5|$|Despite the {{significant}} fortifications in the harbour area, the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, {{and they were}} prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551).

5|$|Fifty years later, the Protestants of London Missionary Society came to New Caledonia, {{which was}} {{followed}} by entry of the French Catholics to the island, in 1843.

50|$|<b>The</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> may {{be derived}} from <b>the</b> bareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> ('da chek lak'), that <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> resembles <b>the</b> red tripletail Perch ('chek lap', 赤鱲), or that the fish was once {{abundant}} in its vicinity.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>island</b> {{has four}} {{distinct}} ecoregions.

5|$|Filipinos {{generally}} {{belong to}} several Asian ethnic groups classified linguistically {{as part of}} the Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian speaking people.

5|$|Glacial {{striation}} and {{the presence}} of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|Having {{established}} control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> between 1651 and 1652 Blake constructed Cromwell's Castle on Tresco, {{named after}} Oliver Cromwell, the Parliamentary leader.
