5|$|The Battle <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays the moment <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> the Great's victory. The vertical format was {{dictated by the}} space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} {{the arms of the}} Stewarts. The basic Stewart coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The buckles used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the canting arms <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three buckles Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John Stewart (d. 1298), younger son <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. Together the couple founded the 'Bonkyl' Stewart branch of the clan, and their descendants tended to use the 'Bonkyl' buckles as their heraldic differencing. One of the couple's sons, Sir Allan Stewart of Dreghorn (d. 1333), founded the Stewart of Darnley branch of the clan, which in time became the earls and dukes of Lennox.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Assyrian Empire, Erbil {{was first}} {{controlled}} by the Medes and then incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire before it became part of the empire <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> the Great after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was fought near Erbil in 331 BC. Subsequently, after the partition <b>of</b> <b>Alexander</b> the Great Empire by his generals (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and {{it was part of the}} Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom. After the 1st c. BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire fought over control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the 1st c. AD, Arbela became an important Christian centre. During the Sassanid period, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (governor). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were persecuted and in 358, the governor became a martyr after he converted to Christianity. A Nestorian school was founded in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in c. 521. During this period, Erbil was also the site of a Zoroastrian fire temple.|$|E
