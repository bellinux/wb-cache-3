40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems {{occur in}} a wide variety {{throughout}} the Mediterranean, especially in sloping and mountainous areas. Recent drivers of change, including the widespread introduction of mechanisation, increased use of (chemical) inputs and (drip) irrigation have considerably added to this diversity. The various systems have very different resource use patterns and environmental and social performances. This article attempts to grasp these differences and to link systems characteristics to options for natural resources management in the spirit of contemporary agricultural policies that seek to promote a more sustainable agriculture. Cluster analysis was employed to classify 28 <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems distinguished by regional typologies developed for six study areas: Tras-os-Montes (Portugal), Cordoba and Granada/Jaen (both in Spain), Haffouz (Tunisia), Basilicata/Salerno (Italy) and West-Crete (Greece). Six types of <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems resulted: (a) very extensive, (b) traditional extensive, (c) semi-intensive low input, (d) semi-intensive high input, (b) intensive and (e) organic. Natural resources management options to address soil erosion, low biodiversity, wildfire risk and excessive water use are explored for each of these systems. In the discussion, it becomes evident that an important quality for a typology lies in its capacity to differentiate likely future development pathways. If options are known, policy-makers can make choices as to what the desired pathway is and what instruments to design to facilitate it...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{with the primary}} purpose of assessing the welfare gain to local residents resulting from olive trees. A secondary but important aim was to underline the multifunctional role of olive farming. In fact, we know that <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> has potentially socially benefits. In particular, it has potentially a lot of positive social effects in rural areas depending on plantation characteristics and farming practices. Therefore, the first section of this paper reviews the main features connected to the multifunctional role of olive farming. Multifunctional role of olive farming is well known in the EU, but it is still needed the institutional intervention in favour of farmers, due to the structural difficulties of olive production sector. Later sections concentrate on a survey carried out in order to estimate the economic value of the rural landscape, focusing in particular on olive trees in a hill region between Italy and Slovenia. From the conducted survey we gauged citizens’ WTP to introduce olive trees in the landscape. Survey data was collected by means of questionnaires. We applied the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) in order to assess the citizens’ Willingness To Pay (WTP) for specific rural landscape features. The paper ends with some conclusions about the positive results obtained in <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> valuation questions. <b>olive</b> <b>plantation,</b> multifunctionality, willingness to pay, rural landscape valuation, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R

50|$|In October 2013 the {{bacterium}} {{was found to}} be infecting olive trees in the region of Apulia in southern Italy.

The bacterium had never previously been confirmed in Europe. Almond and oleander plants in the region have also tested positive for the pathogen. The sub-species involved in Italy is Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca. This shows a marked preference for olive trees and warm conditions and is thought unlikely to spread into Northern Europe.|$|E

50|$|Tell Ezou {{is located}} in a basaltic region with road access from Khirbat Al Hamam, where a well-preserved Bronze Age and neolithic site awaits a more {{extensive}} excavation. It is difficult to classify or schedule as a monument and is situated on private land. The owners were very understanding and the team very well received by the locals during their surveys. They, however, expressed their interest to turn the archaeological site into an <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> or wheat field. This may be his choice but he will have to clear the ancient blocks of basalt left over from prehistory, an obvious risk to the site, but at least Doctor Boustani's team has recorded something here for local, regional and global heritage.|$|R
