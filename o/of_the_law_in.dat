5|$|The two {{earliest}} codes {{were concerned}} with clerical matters, and Æthelstan stated that he acted {{on the advice of}} Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> his reign.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E

50|$|Olaf and Grimketel {{proclaimed the}} {{earliest}} Norwegian church <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> about 1020 at the Moster þing. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> devised by Grimketel, {{was similar to}} that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> England at <b>the</b> time.|$|R
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on the wrong side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E

25|$|Different {{spectral}} variables require different corresponding {{forms of}} expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> general, one may not convert {{between the various}} forms of Planck's law simply by substituting one variable for another, because this would not take into account that the different forms have different units.

25|$|Bar closing {{times were}} {{extended}} to 10 pm in New Zealand on 9 October 1967, {{three weeks after}} a referendum.

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{judicial}} experience, his years in the Alameda County district attorney's office and as state attorney general gave him far more knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> practice than most {{other members of the}} Court.

Over the years he was effective in forging majorities in support of major decisions, and inspiring liberal forces around the nation.|$|E

25|$|The country's {{laws are}} {{published}} in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published. Publishing {{the law in}} Hebrew in the official gazette (Reshumot) {{is enough to make}} it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not understand the meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations, the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).|$|E
25|$|While Conservative Judaism would {{affirm that}} the Torah is Divine in its origin, the revelation at Sinai {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of a relationship and not the final word. Interpretation is understood as our communal attempt to understand the will of a compassionate Divine partner. As we mature we are able to understand God's will for us more clearly. If a law appears unconscionable, we would say that the shortcoming is either our previous understanding or that circumstances have so changed that the rule no longer meets its intended result...The Conservative movement maintains that the purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> the first place is largely to concretize moral values, and so the specific form of the law can and should be changed if it is not effectively doing that. In other words, the Aggadah should control the halakha.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the shops}} {{on the west}} side of Via Roma, which runs southwards from Piazza Mazzini, lay the ghetto which persisted until the {{emancipation}} of the Jews in Piedmont following Charles Albert’s concession of a constitution, the Statuto Albertino, under the revolutionary pressures of 1848. The Synagogue of Casale Monferrato is inside a building at Vicolo Olper 44 that offers no hint from its nondescript exterior that it is a synagogue, built in 1595, and recognized as one of the most beautiful in Europe. The women’s galleries now host an important Jewish museum. Of particular interest are the Tablets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>in</b> gilded wood, dating from the 18th century, numerous Rimonim (finials to scrolls of the Law) and Atarot (crowns for the scrolls of the Law) carved and with silver filigree.|$|E
