5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my <b>own</b> <b>person</b> and not belong to anyone.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your <b>own</b> <b>person,</b> and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with gender}} equality, {{the issue of}} {{parenting}} under the communal way of life was a concern. The parental tendency is to view the child as a personal possession and to dominate them. The founding members of the kibbutz agreed {{that this was not}} conducive to community life. They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their <b>own</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Charles endeavoured {{to raise}} a guard for his <b>own</b> <b>person</b> at York, {{intending}} it, as the event afterwards proved, to form the nucleus of an army, Lord Fairfax was required by Parliament to present a petition to his sovereign, entreating Charles to hearken {{to the voice of}} his Parliament, and to discontinue the raising of troops. This was at a great meeting of the freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heworth Moor on 3 June near York. Charles evaded receiving the petition, pressing his horse forward, but Thomas Fairfax followed him and placed the petition on the pommel of the king's saddle.|$|E

25|$|Increasing {{popularity}} soon diminished caution {{whether the}} new method would help minor ailments and be of benefit to the more seriously injured. Hydropathists occupied themselves mainly with studying chronic invalids well able to bear a rigorous regimen and the severities of unrestricted crisis. The need of a radical adaptation to the former class was first adequately recognized by John Smedley, a manufacturer of Derbyshire, who, impressed in his <b>own</b> <b>person</b> with the severities {{as well as the}} benefits of the cold water cure, practised among his workpeople a milder form of hydropathy, and began about 1852 a new era in its history, founding at Matlock a counterpart of the establishment at Gräfenberg.|$|E
500|$|In {{the process}} of {{planning}} for women's rights conventions, Stone worked against Stanton to remove from any proposed platform the formal advocacy of divorce. Stone wished to keep the subject separate, to prevent the appearance of moral laxity. She pushed [...] "for the right of woman to the control of her <b>own</b> <b>person</b> as a moral, intelligent, accountable being." [...] Other rights were certain to fall into place after women were given {{control of their own}} bodies. Years later, Stone's position on divorce would change.|$|E

[...] "He had led a wild, tough life but it had not turned him either into a rascal or into an uncouth bush dweller," [...] Brelsford writes. [...] "Changa-Changa" [...] endured in the local vernacular as a word roughly meaning [...] "boss", and was still in use in Zambia in the 1970s.

500|$|As {{the sacred}} texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist {{philosophy}} became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer {{to hold that}} in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; [...] "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification [...] "that our true self exists not only in our <b>own</b> <b>person,</b> this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted." ...|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{agreed with}} the President's assertions, and urged him to comment {{publicly}} on the subject, although the other man demurred. When Roosevelt published Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would {{become known as the}} nature fakers controversy: [...] "I wish to express my hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods'... You in your <b>own</b> <b>person</b> have illustrated what can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{practicability}} of ballooning being now fairly established, men {{soon began}} to venture their <b>own</b> <b>persons</b> in the frail cars. A young and enthusiastic naturalist named Rozier leaped into the car of another of Montgolfier's balloons soon after this, and ascended in safety to an elevation of about 300 feet, but on this occasion the balloon was held down by ropes. The ice, however, was broken, and bolder attempts quickly followed.|$|R
500|$|Stone aimed her 1853 {{petitions}} at {{the convention}} that would meet on May 4, 1853, to revise the state constitution. Wendell Phillips drafted both the petition asking that the word “male” be stricken wherever it appeared in the constitution, and an appeal urging Massachusetts citizens to sign it. After canvassing the state for nine months, Stone sent the convention petitions bearing over five thousand signatures. On May 27, 1853, Stone and Phillips addressed the convention’s Committee on Qualifications of Voters. In reporting Stone’s hearing, the Liberator noted: “Never before, since the world was made, in any country, has woman publicly made her demand {{in the hall of}} legislation to be represented in her <b>own</b> <b>person,</b> and to have an equal part in framing the laws and determining the action of government.” ...|$|E
500|$|De Winter's actions during in {{the battle}} have been commended: Edward Pelham Brenton wrote in 1836 that [...] "The Dutch admiral displayed, in his <b>own</b> <b>person,</b> the most undaunted valour ... but was {{compelled}} at length to yield to superior skill, it would be untrue to say superior bravery." [...] while William James noted in 1827 that after the battle [...] ""Batavian prowess" [...] still claimed the respect of an enemy and the applause of the world". De Winter was released from captivity in 1798 after news reached Britain {{that his wife had}} suffered a stroke, and he subsequently became the Batavian ambassador to France, before resuming command of the Dutch fleet {{at the start of the}} Napoleonic Wars. He was a trusted subordinate of Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland between 1806 and 1810, and was honoured by Emperor Napoleon in 1811 before his sudden death in Paris the following year.|$|E
500|$|During the 1930s Wodehouse's {{theatrical}} work tailed off. He wrote or adapted four {{plays for}} the West End; Leave it to Psmith (1930), which he adapted in collaboration with Ian Hay, {{was the only one}} to have a long run. The reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised the play, but commented: [...] "It is Mr Wodehouse's own inimitable narrative comments and descriptions in his <b>own</b> <b>person</b> of the antics of his puppets that one misses. They cannot be got into a play and they are at least half the fun of the novels." [...] In 1934 Wodehouse collaborated with Bolton on the book for Cole Porter's Anything Goes (Porter wrote his own lyrics), but at the last minute their version was almost entirely rewritten by others at the instigation of the producer, who disliked the original script. Concentrating on writing novels and short stories, Wodehouse reached the peak of his productivity in this decade, averaging two books each year, and grossing an annual £100,000.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{writings}} that deal with lesbianism in medieval Europe come from religious texts. The earliest text that shows the Church's disapproval of lesbianism comes from {{the writings}} of St. Paul to the Romans. In his letters, he states:"women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another…and receiving in their <b>own</b> <b>persons</b> the due penalty for their error." ...|$|R
60|$|At this point, it {{is proper}} that I should interpose {{an apology for}} having hastily spoken of such men as Francis of Assisi, even for {{purposes}} of warning, in connection with Mr. Booth.

Free labor ideology dictated that employees be independent, self-reliant, and responsible for their <b>own</b> <b>persons,</b> as well as capable of bargaining for themselves in a competitive marketplace...|$|R
