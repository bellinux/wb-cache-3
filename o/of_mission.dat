5|$|Matlock's next {{assignment}} was as Deputy Chief <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> {{in the capital}} of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam. Even in Africa, knowledge of Soviet Affairs proved useful. With Leonid Brezhnev in power, Soviet foreign policy as of 1968 was dictated by the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that, once a country became Communist, it was never to leave the Soviet sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church of Melanesia, a {{province}} of the Anglican Communion, was established in 1849 by George Augustus Selwyn of New Zealand. Initially, it was the Church of the Province of New Zealand, but in 1975 it became part of an ecclesiastical Province covering Solomon Islands, the Republic of Vanuatu and the French Territory of New Caledonia in the South Western Pacific. The Church of Melanesia in Honiara operates three missions, the Melanesian Board <b>of</b> <b>Mission,</b> the Melanesian Brotherhood and the Mission to Seafarers Society from Honiara. The Melanesian Board <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> oversees the Home Mission and the mission in other regional countries. The Most Reverend. David Vunagi has been archbishop of Melanesia since May 2009, when he formally took over the post at the Cathedral Church of St Barnabas, Honiara.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico.

Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 8 (I-8) is an Interstate Highway in {{the southwestern}} United States. It runs from the {{southern}} edge <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> Bay at Sunset Cliffs Boulevard in San Diego, California, almost at the Pacific Ocean, to the junction with I-10, just southeast of Casa Grande, Arizona. In California, the freeway travels through the San Diego metropolitan area as the Ocean Beach Freeway and the Mission Valley Freeway before traversing the Cuyamaca Mountains and providing access through the Imperial Valley, including the city of El Centro. Crossing the Colorado River into Arizona, I-8 continues through the city of Yuma across the Sonoran Desert to Casa Grande, in between the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.|$|E

According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him {{responsibility for the}} Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP.|$|E
5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type <b>of</b> <b>mission</b> at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046.

5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types <b>of</b> {{research}} missions: <b>missions</b> <b>of</b> discovery, <b>missions</b> <b>of</b> opportunity, and <b>missions</b> <b>of</b> investigation. A <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> discovery involves simulating {{life on a}} Martian environment to uncover unanticipated problems. The <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> opportunity focuses on the technological aspect of life on Mars. Engineers and scientists use their knowledge and data to find solutions for specific situations. One example <b>of</b> a <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> opportunity is testing new technologies. The <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> investigation tests the tools and approaches needed to carry out exploration of Mars; it focuses on the main conflicts that have been anticipated. When simulating a crisis, {{the plan is to}} isolate the situation and limit the elements that play a role. In any situation, there will be many minor elements that cannot all be accounted for. The simulated explorations allow these minor details to be uncovered and fixed.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops an {{exit strategy}} for missions, drawing upon {{the experience of the}} Wesleyan Church in Africa. This is approached in four sections: a literature review, a summary <b>of</b> Wesleyan <b>mission</b> work in Africa, a model for mission work that has been developed within the Wesleyan Church, and applications of the model. The model proposes five stages through which the work <b>of</b> <b>missions</b> progresses: the development of converts, disciples, pastors, leaders and partners. The fourth chapter includes a discussion of related models: the Three Eras <b>of</b> <b>Missions</b> and the Two Types <b>of</b> <b>Missions.</b> At the completion of the 5 Stages <b>of</b> <b>Missions</b> the establishment <b>of</b> a mature national church, fully engaged in international missions and international church leadership, has been achieved. This dissertation concludes that final departure may not be necessary for all missionaries. However, complete handover of leadership is essential.

5|$|The {{history of}} San Diego State University {{began in the}} late 19th century with the {{establishment}} of a normal school in San Diego, California. Founded on March 13, 1897, the school opened on November 1, 1898 with a class of 135 students. By 1921, the school had become San Diego State Teachers College, allowing it to grant certificates and degrees. Due to the increased student enrollment, the college was relocated to its current location at the east side <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> Valley, with classes beginning in February 1931. The government works programs during the Great Depression assisted in construction of numerous buildings on the new campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{this stretch of}} SR52 had many effects on the {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on the western part <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR52.|$|E
