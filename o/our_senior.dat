The Kennel Club states that [...] "Professor Sampson is <b>our</b> <b>senior</b> representative and spokesman on the health and genetic issues affecting dogs.

According to Zehr, the group would play several shows a week that were booked under different band names to get around local clubs' rules preventing artists from playing that close to each other. Their playing then got the attention of Mike Denneen, Boston-based producer of Fountains of Wayne, who agreed to help them produce a 2-song demo record.
