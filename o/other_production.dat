5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops {{to be used to}} this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than <b>other</b> <b>production</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Leblanc {{process was}} {{effectively}} {{replaced by the}} Solvay process without a hydrochloric acid by-product. Since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated <b>other</b> <b>production</b> methods, {{some of which are}} still used today. After the year 2000, hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing by-product hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{employed}} low-fidelity recording equipment, {{which allowed}} him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording Illinois. Typically, his process involved recording to 32kHz 8-track tape using inexpensive microphones such as the Shure SM57 and AKG C1000. He then employed Pro Tools for mixing and <b>other</b> <b>production</b> tasks.|$|E

5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and <b>other</b> <b>production</b> benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. <b>Other</b> <b>production</b> houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with <b>other</b> <b>production</b> deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E

5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and <b>other</b> <b>production</b> sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, {{a far cry from}} the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be convinced by <b>other</b> <b>production</b> staff to cast him.|$|E

5|$|Costume {{designer}} Sue Blane was not keen {{on working}} for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of The Maids, where Curry had worn a woman's corset in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the corset from the <b>other</b> <b>production</b> for Rocky Horror. Blane admits {{that she did not}} conduct research for her designing, had never seen a science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.|$|E
5|$|De Laurentiis {{felt the}} only way to save the {{production}} was to find a new director and have the script rewritten. The <b>other</b> <b>production</b> companies were not content with De Laurentiis stopping production, which led Les Films Marceau-Cocinor to terminate its contract with Italy Film. A.S. Film Produccion confiscated the footage and took cameras, costumes, and weapons that had been rented by Italy Film, which nearly bankrupted the company. De Laurentiis restarted production with financial backing from distributor Paramount Pictures, and hired Mario Bava as director. The budget was also cut to 200 million lire, {{less than half of the}} original budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket line against Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself.

5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had <b>other</b> <b>production</b> commitments.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the <b>other</b> <b>production</b> plants and became the prototypes {{for a new generation of}} plants.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{teething}} {{problems with the}} Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to <b>other</b> <b>production</b> facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs had been built by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According to audit records in Berlin, {{by the end of}} the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had been spent on Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s had been built.|$|E
5|$|The main {{production}} company behind Audition was the Japanese company Omega Project. Omega were originally behind {{the production of}} Hideo Nakata's film Ring; {{this was a great}} success in Japan and, subsequently, the rest of Asia. Omega had problems setting up the release of Ring in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of the Ring. The following year, in 1998, Omega partnered again with AFDF Korea and <b>other</b> <b>production</b> companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami's 1997 novel Audition. Omega wanted to create a film different than supernatural-themed Ring, and chose to adapt Murakami's novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known for working on horror films. Prior to Audition, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father (Shohei Imamura) on The Eel, which won the Palme d'Or in 1997.|$|E
