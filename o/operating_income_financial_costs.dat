40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hypotheses}} that implementing effective {{total quality management}} (TQM) programs improves the operating performance of firms. The winning of quality awards {{is used as a}} proxy for the effective implementation of TQM programs. Changes in various performance measures for a test sample of quality-award winners are compared against a sample of control firms. Our statistical tests provide strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards outperform the control firms on operating income-based measures. Over a 10 -year period, from 6 years before to 3 years after the year of winning the first quality award, the mean (median) change in the <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> for the test sample is 107 % (48 %) higher than that of the control sample. There is reasonably strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards do better on sales growth than the control firms. Over the 10 -year period, the mean (median) change in sales for the test sample is 64 % (24 %) higher than that of the control sample. We also find weak evidence that firms in our test sample are more successful in controlling costs when compared with the firms in the control sample. In addition, the results indicate that firms in our test sample increased their capital expenditures more than the control sample over the time period prior to winning quality awards. Compared with the control sample, the test sample shows higher growth in both employment and total assets. total quality management, quality awards, <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> sales, <b>costs,</b> <b>financial</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Due to the {{deregulation}} of the financial market in 80 s decade, the financialization of wealth has become a globalized systemic pattern, giving companies greater access to financial innovations. In view of the above, {{the objective is to}} analyze whether the appreciation of capital through the financial system is preferred over the capital appreciation through production. Methodology. This is a descriptive research slitting with cross-sectional perspective, in which we considered information belonging to 106 listed non-financial companies in Brazil (2004 – 2012). Findings.

40|$|Although {{healthcare}} in Australia {{is largely}} publicly funded, there are out-of-pocket {{costs associated with}} diagnosis, treatment and survival, even in the public system. In Australia, people with cancer report relatively high out-of-pocket health costs and a heavy burden of out-of-pocket costs relative to income. These costs include travel, hospital stays, specialist fees, parking, treatment prescriptions and over-the-counter medications for supportive care. The financial impacts of the disease extend to reduced or lost employment, early retirement and reduced <b>incomes.</b> The <b>financial</b> <b>costs</b> of cancer in Australia are also unequally distributed in that some cancer types are more costly to the individual. Those living in rural and remote areas also face greater out-of-pocket costs, as do those who use the private health system. Cancer-related costs are not restricted to those experiencing a diagnosis of cancer, but also extend to carers and families and can be enduring. While reducing costs is an important long-term goal, ameliorating financial impacts is also important in the short term.

50|$|The cost of {{treatment}} {{of some of}} these diseases, however, such as Buruli ulcer, can amount to over twice the yearly income of an average household in the lowest income quartile, while for the highest income quartile, the burden is slightly less than the average household <b>income.</b> These enormous <b>financial</b> <b>costs</b> often cause deferral {{of treatment}} and financial ruin, but there is inequality between the wealthy and poor in terms of economic burden. These diseases also cost the government in terms of health care and lost worker productivity through morbidity and shortened life spans. In Kenya, for example, deworming is estimated to increase average adult income by 40 percent, which is a benefit-to-cost ratio of 100. Each untreated case of Trachoma is estimated to cost US$118 in lost productivity. Each case of schistosomiasis causes a loss of 45.4 days of work per year. Most of the diseases cost the economies of various developing countries millions of dollars. Large scale prevention campaigns are predicted to increase agricultural output and education levels.|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} use (and indeed tremendous {{growth in}} volume) of forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps as hedges against interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk indicates that hedging does add {{value to the}} firm. The purpose this research was to empirically examine the value of off-balance-sheet hedging. The benefits of off-balance-sheet hedging were found to accrue from reducing (1) taxes, (2) expected <b>financial</b> distress <b>costs,</b> and (3) agency costs. Taxes. Hedging reduces the firm's tax liability by reducing the variability in taxable income. The value of hedging to the firm is a positive function of the convexity of the tax function and the variability of taxable <b>income.</b> Expected <b>Financial</b> Distress <b>Costs.</b> The value of hedging is a positive function {{of the degree to}} which hedging reduces the probability of financial distress and the <b>costs</b> of <b>financial</b> distress. Agency <b>Cost.</b> Due to the fact that bondholders and some managers hold fixed claims while shareholders hold variable claims, shareholders desire more risky projects than do bondholders or managers. Hedging reduces this conflict by allowing shareholders to undertake higher risk projects while protecting the holders of fixed claims. Firms can achieve the same benefits of hedging by using alternative strategies. Among the various alternatives to hedging are modifying the firm's capital structure, purchasing insurance, and modifying dividend policy. The amount of off-balance-sheet hedging activity undertaken by a specific firm is therefore a function of the value of hedging to the firm and the degree to which the firm has used alternatives to hedging. Using a regression analysis, this paper provides empirical evidence on the preceding relations. This study provides (1) the first empirical evidence into the reasons for a value-maximizing firm using off-balance-sheet hedging instruments, and (2) empirical insights into the way in which the firm's hedging decision interrelates with the capital structure, dividend, and insurance decisions...|$|R
