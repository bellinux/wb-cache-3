25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|E

25|$|Modern Spanish {{no longer}} uses the {{apostrophe}} to indicate elision in standard writing, {{although it can}} sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose. Instead Spanish writes out the spoken elision in full (de enero, mi hijo) except for the contraction del for de + el, which uses no apostrophe. Spanish also switches to a form that {{is identical to the}} masculine article (but is actually a variant of the feminine article) immediately before a feminine noun beginning with a stressed a instead of writing (<b>or</b> <b>saying)</b> an elision: un águila blanca, el águila blanca, and el agua pura but una/la blanca águila and la pura agua. This reflects the origin of the Spanish definite articles from the Latin demonstratives ille/illa/illum.|$|E

25|$|Many criticisms {{focus on}} {{versions}} of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's anthropic cosmological principle, which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence {{of life as a}} necessary prerequisite for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger {{versions of the}} anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.|$|E

[...] Traditionally, this means the students must do a [...] "class set" [...] of pushups, one for each year of their class. [...] The Class of 1945 did only 45 pushups and an extra pushup has been added for each subsequent year; the Fighting Texas Aggie Class of 2012 now does 112. [...] Pulling out privileges of the class directly above is considered [...] "Good Bull", but pulling out two classes or more is [...] "Bad Bull." [...] Members of the Corps of Cadets generally take privileged words more seriously than non-reg students.|$|E

[...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God".

500|$|Jwé (play) {{is a form}} {{of rural}} Lucian folk music {{associated}} with beach parties, wakes, débòt dances and full moon gatherings. [...] Jwé is performed as an informal, social event that provide the chance for Lucians to show off their verbal skills, and communicate their comedic, social and political commentaries without offending people. [...] Jwé includes both songs for men and women, both of which can be singers, though most Lucian folk instrumentalists are male. A jwé performance is considered good if the audience participates enthusiastically by clapping, responding to the leader and singing and dancing. Some Lucians avoid jwé altogether because of its sexually raunchy lyricism and atmosphere; nevertheless, elements of jwé have entered mainstream Lucian culture, {{such as the use of}} lang dévivé, <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> the opposite of what is meant.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Qandil {{moved to}} the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began hosting a program on Dubai TV called Qalam Rosas ("Pencil"). The program was {{virtually}} a continuation of Ra'is al-Tahrir, a highly watched show dealing with the Arab world's major political, economic and social affairs of the day. Qalam Rosas would normally open with Qandil interviewing an Arab intellectual and discussing a current event. The show would then continue to a round table discussion with other journalists analyzing various social and political events and movements concerning {{the citizens of the}} Arab world. At its closing, Qandil would summarize the show with a well-known maxim <b>or</b> <b>saying.</b> The London-based Arab Media Watch organization awarded Qandil the 2006 Media Accomplishment Award to commend him for his [...] "creativity and participation in the media world" [...] {{over the course of his}} five decade career.
