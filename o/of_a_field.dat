Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions.

5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters.

5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
