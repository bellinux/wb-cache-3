2500|$|... "River" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track, of which Nicky suggested its title {{as the music}} made him think of one when he heard it. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles if she preferred another, but she liked his title and went with it. Nicky spoke about Enya's style of composing for song: [...] "There are five synths Midi'd but then she plays chords over these random arpeggiators with notes popping in and <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> don't expect them. Somehow she makes that work". [...] "The Longships" [...] makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who first invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841. [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'Ã³ige", translated from Gaelic as [...] "The Brighter Days of My Youth", is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya's childhood, and receives a dedication in Gaelic to her grandparents.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Styx {{was accused}} of putting the {{backward}} message [...] "Satan move through our voices" [...] on the song [...] "Snowblind", from Paradise Theatre. Guitarist James Young called these charges [...] "rubbish," [...] and responded, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a statement, we'll {{do it in a way}} that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." [...] The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message. In 1983, the band released a concept album, Kilroy Was Here, satirizing the Moral Majority.|$|E

50|$|By 2013, Baner had {{returned}} as drummer {{for the release}} of the band's fourth studio album, Come <b>Out</b> From <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Hide. Come <b>Out</b> From <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Hide featured professionally-recorded versions of several of the songs first heard on Lucid Dreams, as well as several songs that had not been previously recorded. Come <b>Out</b> From <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Hide displays strong influence from Carton's travels to France and Africa. Carton (who wrote all fifteen songs for the album) also made an effort to vary the construction of the music and include diverse topics - not just love songs. The attempts at variety were praised, and the songs were once again compared to musical theater, but as with Hidden Deep in the Green, critics found the songs to be too much alike.|$|R

"You'll excuse my {{naming of}} it, sir," [...] he said, {{regarding}} with much commiseration the mere {{surface of the}} vicar's face; [...] "but perhaps you don't know that your chin have bust <b>out</b> a-bleeding <b>where</b> <b>you</b> cut yourself a-shaving this morning, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah well, {{you have}} pluck in you, I see, only {{it needs a}} {{considerable}} stirring. Come, {{this is a good}} quarrel of ours. Let us fight it <b>out.</b> Stand <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, and I will give the word of command. Now; ready, aim, fire!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, but it's a {{very dark}} daylight. Don't leave your warm bed for the {{dampness}} and cold <b>out</b> here; stay <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are; I'll get breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{twenty miles}} to leeward of the Inlet, and perhaps eight off the shore. At least, I {{should like to}} believe we are. How is it you look so fresh, instead of worn <b>out?</b> <b>Where</b> did <b>you</b> learn to make {{yourself}} {{at home in a}} boat?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} is the wench afraid of?" [...] said the other fellow. [...] "I tell you you shall come to no harm; but if you will not leave the road and come with us, d--n me, but I'll beat your brains <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Tytherleigh rested {{an elbow}} on the table, and {{thrusting}} {{his fingers through}} his hair, stared down at the note-book in which he had been writing down her answers.

6000|$|I {{have had}} a great deal of {{pleasant}} time with Rice lately, and am getting initiated into a little band. They call drinking deep dyin' scarlet.

6000|$|... "The ape-men," [...] he cried. [...] "My God, what brutes! Don't {{raise your}} voice, for {{they have long}} ears--sharp eyes, too, but no power of scent, so far as I could judge, so I don't think they can sniff us <b>out.</b> <b>Where</b> have <b>you</b> been, young fellah?

6000|$|... "'Tis true mayhap {{that you}} would not be here, now, mejuffrouw," [...] he said blandly, [...] "but I could only act for the best, and as speedily as I could. The moment I heard that you were in the hands of brigands I moved heaven and earth to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were. I only heard this morning that you were in Rotterdam...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I {{know that}} very well, and I was {{determined}} to find <b>out</b> <b>WHERE</b> <b>you</b> had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne. It {{is a very large}} one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly," [...] {{interrupted}} Lieutenant D'Hubert, with {{an innocent}} laugh, [...] "I {{think you ought}} to be. I had no end of trouble to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were. It wasn't exactly the place for you to disport yourself in under the circumstances. If the general had caught you there making eyes at the goddess of the temple.... Oh, my word!... He hates to be bothered with complaints against his officers, you know. And it looked uncommonly like sheer bravado." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad or sane," [...] said Geoffrey, [...] "say {{those words}} {{once more and}} I will stamp the life <b>out</b> of <b>you</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. You say that God promised her to you--promised that woman to a hound like you. Ah, be careful!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Neither gammon nor spinach. You owe {{me three}} hundred pounds, you've owed it me for years, {{and you have}} the impudence to take this {{attitude}} with me, have you? Now, I never bluster; I say what I mean. You just listen to me. Either you pay me what you owe me at once, or I call this meeting and make what I know public. You'll very soon find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. And a good thing, too, for a more unscrupulous--unscrupulous---" [...] he paused for breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll {{allow me}} to tell you exactly what I think," [...] I ventured, [...] "frankly I think you have made a mistake. There's that matter of Reggie Sidley. He was {{worrying}} me all yesterday morning to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were, and when I evaded the point he told me straight that he didn't believe you were the Bundercombes at all. He is always in and out of this place, and if he sees your name on the register--or his mother, Lady Enterdean, sees it--it seems to me it's about all up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You need feel {{no fear of}} my {{attempting}} to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, and of my trying to persuade you to return to me. I am not quite foolish enough to do that. You {{are not in a}} fit state of mind to return to me. You are all wrong, all over, from head to foot. When you get right again, I am vain enough to think that you will return to me of your own accord. And shall I be weak enough to forgive you? Yes! I shall certainly be weak enough to forgive you.|$|E

5000|$|Lead singer Lexi Valentine {{said that}} the album [...] "is about finding <b>out</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{want to go and}} getting there without {{stopping}} for anything â but taking those things that matter along the way" [...] when asked about the record. She also stated that [...] "It's also about power, strength and heart. And being honest with yourself. The sound is hopeful, bright, and at peace with life's twists and turns." ...|$|R
