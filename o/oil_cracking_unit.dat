40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> on {{fluorescence}} color, homogenization temperature (Tho) and trapping pressure (Pt) of oil inclusions from deeply buried reservoirs (DBRs) (3672 – 4359 m) {{in the northern}} Dongying Depression were determined based on fluorescence spectroscopy and homogenization temperatures of oil inclusions, kinetic modeling of crude <b>oil</b> <b>cracking,</b> and petroleum inclusion thermodynamics modeling. The modeling results demonstrate that fluorescence color, Tho and predicted Pt have strong relationships with the transformation rate via <b>cracking</b> of <b>oil</b> to gas (Tr), and the formation temperature (Tf) that the inclusions experienced. The fluorescence color is hardly influenced at all during {{the initial stages of}} <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> (Tr < 13 %, Tf < 160 °C), but fluorescence color begins to shift toward shorter wavelengths (blue shift) during progressive <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> (Tr < 24 %, Tf < 190 °C). With further <b>oil</b> <b>cracking,</b> the fluorescence color may either experience no change or continue its blue shift. Eventually the fluorescence color will disappear as the aromatic compounds are completely cracked. The Tho increases at first (Tr < 24 %, Tf < 190 °C), but then decreases or even becomes negative during major <b>oil</b> <b>cracking.</b> The reconstructed Pt values show a corresponding reverse trend. Oil inclusions from DBRs and other shallow reservoirs in the Dongying Depression show an obvious blue shift in fluorescence color at a depth of approximate 4000 m (Tf = 160 °C) and generally contain solid bitumen below 4000 m, supporting the effect of <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> on fluorescence variation, consistent with the modeling result. The Tho from DBRs in the Minfeng area increases with increasing burial depth (Tf < 190 °C), which is also consistent with the modeling results. However, the Tho of oil inclusions with blue-white fluorescence from DBRs in the Shengtuo area did not show such a trend. Recent trapping, high trapping pressure and higher-maturity oil may have led to a low-degree of <b>oil</b> <b>cracking,</b> and thus less modification of Tho in the Shengtuo area. <b>Oil</b> <b>cracking</b> results in consistent volume ratios of pyrobitumen to oil inclusions (Fvpy) in the same fluid inclusion assemblage, and the Fvpy value increases with <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> level, which can be used to recognize if <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> has occurred in oil inclusions and what level of <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> they have experienced. As the <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> model used in this study did not account for the role of pressure, it is more applicable for oil inclusions that were trapped under normally pressured conditions. Oil inclusions trapped under overpressured conditions will be less influenced by <b>oil</b> <b>cracking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> gas resources {{is necessary and}} urgent in the gas exploration of these basins at high to over stage in China. A marine crude oil sample was pyrolyzed using sealed gold tubes system in our study. The pyrolysates including gas, liquid, and solid were quantitatively analyzed. Based on the pyrolysis data and kinetic calculation, the yield correlativity among gas, liquid, and solid products was regressed with high correlative coefficients to establish a prediction model suitable for the resource estimation of <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> gas. The verification formula for this model was also established {{on the principle of}} mass conservation. The affecting factors and the application preconditions of this model were discussed. Finally the model was extrapolated to the {{prediction of}} <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> gas resources of Feixianguan formation in NE Sichuan basin, SW China. The prediction value of <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> resources is about 6. 84 × 1012 [*]m 3, and generation intensity of <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> gas is about 97. 5 × 108 [*]m 3 /km 2, and the paleo-oil reserves is about 97 × 108 [*]t.

40|$|It is the {{consensus}} that sapropelic matter generated oil initially, subsequently, the <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> into {{gas in the}} process of hydrocarbon generation evolution; however, there exist a dispute considering how much gas is generated directly by kerogen as well as how to identify it. The experimental samples are low mature sapropelic shale from the Xiamaling Formation in North China; the experimental devices are high-temperature and high pressured golden tube system and normal autoclave thermal simulation; gas generation simulation experiments of original kerogen, residual kerogen and oil from the same shale are developed. It is concluded that: (1) the gas generated from kerogen directly accounts for about 20 % after the oil generation peak period. The main gas generating stage is from 422  °C to 566  °C (RO =  1. 3 %– 2. 5 %), and the amount produces 85. 5 %. (2) The value of ln (C 1 /C 2) and ln (C 2 /C 3) increase with the growth of evolution degree for both kerogen <b>cracking</b> gas and <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> gas. However, at over-mature period, the value of ln (C 2 /C 3) increases for the kerogen cracking gas while the value for <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> gas remains constant, and the value of ln (C 1 /C 2) at low heating rate is greater than that at a high heating rate. (3) The new <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> gas discrimination chart is established whilst taking into considering the evolution degree. The gas from the Sinian and Cambrian in the Sichuan Basin is <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> gas from the preceding understanding.

40|$|Due to high thermal stability, diamondoids resist <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> {{and become}} more concentrated, while {{biomarkers}} crack and decrease in concentration. Therefore, the extent of <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> can be investigated by plotting both diamondoid and biomarker concentrations. Furthermore, mixtures of high- and low-maturity oil can be identified when concentrations of both biomarkers and diamondoids are high. Forty-one crude oil samples from the North Slope of Alaska have variable diamondoid and biomarker concentrations, which indicate different extents of <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> (Figure 1). Some of the samples are mixtures of high- and low-maturity components because they contain high concentrations of both diamondoids and biomarkers.

The CSIA analyses were used to correlate the high-maturity components, while biomarkers, especially those providing information on {{the age of the}} source rock, were used to correlate the lower-maturity components.

30|$|According to thermal {{cracking}} and secondary reactions of heavy hydrocarbons {{occurring in the}} FCC process, {{it is believed that}} radical reactions for hydrocarbon precracking happen mainly on catalyst matrix at high temperature in the first reaction zone of the catalyst riser. Because chain paraffin reacts to mainly form ethylene, methane and α-olefins by radical reactions, heavy <b>oil</b> <b>cracking</b> on matrix easily forms dry gas and coke in this section. Dominant reactions in catalytic cracking take place in the secondary reaction zone of the catalyst riser. The cracking reactions in this section are based on the carbenium reaction mechanism and dependent on catalyst zeolites.
