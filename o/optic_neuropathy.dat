5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review aims {{to provide}} an update of {{applications}} of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) for disease modeling, cell/gene therapy, and drug screening for <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a characteristic of <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> Human iPSCs can serve as a model to investigate disease pathology and potential repair mechanisms. In recent years, significant {{progress has been made in}} generating RGCs from iPSCs. Various groups have reported the potential of iPSCs for modeling <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies,</b> such as glaucoma. The literature also highlights the potential to use iPSC-derived cells for high-throughput drug and toxicity screening. SUMMARY: The present review summarizes current work in the field of iPSCs in <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> Future studies to characterize iPSC-derived RGCs in a more in-depth manner will help expand the use of iPSCs to model and treat optic neuropathic diseases. Furthermore, iPSC modeling can be used in drug development by offering a new avenue to test novel therapeutic drugs for <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

Point mutations in various complex I subunits derived from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can also result in Leber's Hereditary <b>Optic</b> <b>Neuropathy.</b> There {{is some evidence}} that complex I defects {{may play a role in}} the etiology of Parkinson's disease, perhaps because of reactive oxygen species (complex I can, like complex III, leak electrons to oxygen, forming highly toxic superoxide).|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> However, a normal study does not rule out <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis.

40|$|International {{audience}} Dominant <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies</b> causing fiber loss in {{the optic}} nerve {{are among the most}} frequent inherited mitochondrial diseases. In most genetically resolved cases, the disease is associated to a mutation in OPA 1, which encodes an inner mitochondrial dynamin involved in network fusion, cristae structure and mitochondrial genome maintenance. OPA 1 cleavage is regulated by two m-AAA proteases, SPG 7 and AFG 3 L 2, which are, respectively involved in Spastic Paraplegia 7 and Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia 28. Here, we identified a novel mutation c. 1402 C>T in AFG 3 L 2, modifying the arginine 468 in cysteine in an evolutionary highly conserved arginine-finger motif, in a family with optic atrophy and mild intellectual disability. Ophthalmic examinations disclosed a loss of retinal nerve fibers on the temporal and nasal sides of the optic disk and a red-green dyschromatopsia. Thus, our results suggest that neuro-ophthalmological symptom as optic atrophy might be associated with AFG 3 L 2 mutations, and should prompt the screening of this gene in patients with isolated and syndromic inherited <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|This type of inheritance, {{also known}} as {{maternal}} inheritance, applies to genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers can pass on mitochondrial DNA conditions to their children. An example {{of this type of}} disorder is Leber's hereditary <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> It is important to stress {{that the vast majority of}} mitochondrial disease (particularly when symptoms develop in early life) is actually caused by an underlying nuclear gene defect, and most often follows autosomal recessive inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Given its rarity, {{the optimal}} {{treatment}} for acute <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy</b> in Behçet's disease {{has not been}} established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment {{may be required to}} prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathy.</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Recent {{studies have}} shown that focal {{narrowing}} of retinal arterioles in the parapapillary region occurs in eyes with <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies</b> such as glaucoma. This study evaluated whether these vessel constrictions detected ophthalmoscopically have an equivalent in angiographic imaging of the fundus.  METHODS—Fluorescein angiograms and colour wide angle fundus photographs of 33  patients with open angle glaucoma and 76  subjects with normal optic nerves were examined for focal narrowing of retinal arterioles. The angiograms had primarily been taken for other reasons such as age related macula degeneration.  RESULTS—All focal narrowings of retinal arterioles detected on fundus photographs showed a localised constriction of vessel filling in the fluorescein angiograms. Degree of vessel narrowing on the fundus photographs and degree of constriction of the fluorescein vessel filling were significantly (p< 0. 001) correlated with each other.  CONCLUSIONS—Focal narrowing of retinal arterioles in the parapapillary region of eyes with <b>optic</b> <b>neuropathies</b> represents a real stenosis of the vessel lumen and is not due to an ophthalmoscopic artefact.    Keywords: fluorescein angiography; focal vessel constriction; glaucoma; optic dis...|$|R
