25|$|When it {{came time}} for the Roosevelt family to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, Alice buried a Voodoo doll of the new First Lady, Nellie Taft, in the front yard. Later, the Taft White House banned her from her former residence—the first but not the last {{administration}} to do so. During Woodrow Wilson's administration (from which she was banned in 1916 for a bawdy joke at Wilson's expense), Alice worked against the entry of the United States into the League of Nations.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the United States {{government}} {{responded to}} the Y2K threat by passing the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, by working with private sector counterparts {{in order to ensure}} readiness, and by creating internal continuity of operations plans in the event of problems. The effort was coordinated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House by the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, headed by John Koskinen. The White House effort was conducted in co-ordination with the then-independent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and an interim Critical Infrastructure Protection Group, then in the Department of Justice, now in Homeland Security.|$|E
25|$|Van Maanen 2 (van Maanen's Star) {{is a white}} dwarf. It is a dense, compact stellar remnant that is {{no longer}} {{generating}} energy, having about 68% of the Sun's mass but only 1% of the Sun's radius. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs known, it is, at 13.9 light-years, the third closest to the Sun, after Sirius B and Procyon B, in that order, and the closest known solitary white dwarf. Discovered in 1917 by Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen, Van Maanen 2 was the third white dwarf identified, after 40 Eridani B and Sirius B, and the first that was not a member of a multi-star system. A spectrographic plate made in 1917 shows evidence of planetary matter around the star.|$|E
25|$|The Ossian H. Sweet House is {{a privately}} owned house located at 2905 Garland Street in Detroit, Michigan. Designed by Maurice Herman Finkel, the residence's second owner was {{physician}} Ossian Sweet, an African-American, and <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> a confrontation in 1925 between the Sweet {{family and a}} mob attempting to force them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predominantly <b>white</b> neighborhood. <b>The</b> house was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and listed on <b>the</b> National Register <b>of</b> Historic Places in 1985.|$|R

25|$|Charles Carroll {{was portrayed}} by actor Terrence Currier in the 2004 film National Treasure with Nicolas Cage. He is {{accurately}} {{described as the}} last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Although the film does not explicitly state it, it is implied that Carroll died in Washington, D.C. It is inaccurately stated that Carroll was a Mason; historians of freemasonry agree {{that there is no}} evidence that he was, though his son (also named Charles Carroll) is known to have been a member. A scene which did not make the final cut of the film (but appears as a deleted scene on the DVD) shows then-President Jackson rushing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House to find Carroll's body in a carriage. Carroll is mentioned in the movie Gone with the Wind.|$|E
25|$|Much of hippie style {{had been}} {{integrated}} into mainstream American society {{by the early}} 1970s. Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival and Monterey Pop Festival and the 1968 Isle of Wight Festival became the norm, evolving into stadium rock in the process. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the 1971 May Day Protests as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington DC. President Nixon himself actually ventured <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House and chatted {{with a group of}} the 'hippie' protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in 1973. During the mid 1970s, {{with the end of the}} draft and the Vietnam War, a renewal of patriotic sentiment associated with the approach of the United States Bicentennial and the emergence of punk in London, Manchester, New York and Los Angeles, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was a revival of the Mod subculture, skinheads, teddy boys and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the goths (an arty offshoot of punk) and football casuals. Acid rock gave way to prog rock, heavy metal, disco, and punk rock.|$|E
25|$|Back in 1973, Wolverine {{contacts}} Xavier and Beast then recruit Quicksilver {{to release}} the young Magneto from his prison underneath the Pentagon, {{where he had been}} captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the Paris Peace Accords but then decides to take matters at his own. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to be able to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their White House unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium around the White House as a barricade. Using his powers, Magneto pulls the safe room <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President Richard Nixon and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future.|$|E
5|$|However, before <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice <b>White,</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Gear Company and <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Gears NBL team, pulled <b>the</b> team <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league. <b>White</b> {{planned to}} create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and <b>the</b> players <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who {{ended up on the}} Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|R
25|$|After the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent {{paramilitary}} groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office: <b>the</b> <b>White</b> League, {{which started in}} Louisiana in 1874; and the Red Shirts, which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect Wade Hampton as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as <b>the</b> military arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South. In addition, {{there were thousands of}} Confederate veterans in what were called rifle clubs.|$|R
50|$|Crass was an {{organizer}} and educator with the Catalyst Project from 2000 through 2011. The Catalyst Project, {{based in the}} San Francisco Bay Area, grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Challenging <b>White</b> Supremacy workshop, which was founded by Sharon Martinas and Mickey Ellinger in 1992. Crass worked with Challenging <b>White</b> Supremacy after <b>the</b> 1999 WTO mass actions in Seattle, Washington to help strengthen anti-racist politics and practice in <b>the</b> mostly <b>white</b> sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Global Justice Movement. Movement elders Elizabeth 'Betita' Martinez, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and Paul Kivel were also key mentors to the younger generation organizers in Catalyst Project.

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{incendiary}} exchange between Roosevelt and MacArthur occurred over an administration proposal to cut 51% of the Army's budget. [...] In response, MacArthur lectured Roosevelt that [...] "when {{we lost the}} next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spat out his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur, but Roosevelt." [...] In response, Roosevelt yelled [...] "you must not talk that way to the President!"

50|$|Consequently, {{the city}} was divided into white and black suburbs. <b>The</b> <b>white</b> suburbs were mostly wealthy and well-{{developed}}, and located in the nicest areas in the Johannesburg region. Black South Africans lived in poorly developed townships and suburbs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> suburbs. Many large freeways were built to link Johannesburg with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> South Africa, although this permitted the further outward expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city along the N1, N3, and M2 roadways.

50|$|As Jerry in his can rolls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, Tom {{is carried}} out by the rolling fish cans and off the pier, until he glides through the air and stops as his tail, then his arm, and then his body {{register}} that gravity is imminent. Tom dangles in midair, has his face stretched, and finally falls into the sea. Tom soon jumps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>white</b> with fear, followed by a huge, hungry shark. The cat grabs onto an offshoot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pier and pulls himself down so as to flip himself just <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking shark below him. The cat then gets splattered with a drop of water and jumps back onto the pier as the shark laughs evilly. Tom responds by throwing an anchor onto the receding sharks head, causing it to badmouth the cat as Tom taunts it.|$|R

He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House on a gurney." ...|$|E

5|$|On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for {{the first}} time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to {{activate}} Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>white</b> pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|R

25|$|Theodore Roosevelt hired {{architect}} Charles Follen McKim {{to reorganize}} the layout and use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.
