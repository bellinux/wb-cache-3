5|$|According to Michel Beluet, {{the former}} {{director}} of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who claimed that more than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> respondents tithed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with money to be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to use the money to build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of the Wanli era and those of his two successors, an {{economic}} crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empire's chief medium of exchange: silver. The Portuguese first established trade with China in 1516, trading Japanese silver for Chinese silk, and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle Macau as their permanent trade base in China. Their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the Spanish, while even the Dutch challenged them for control of this trade. Philip IV of Spain (reigned 1621–1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from New Spain and Peru across the Pacific through the Philippines towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined silver through Spanish ports. In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, cutting off another source of silver coming into China. These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline. In the 1630s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce; and, by 1643 <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> an ounce. For peasants this meant economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million. <b>Only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{new method}} of solar cell {{production}} enables silicon {{to be used}} that is 1,000 times less pure and requires <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the energy to manufacture compared to traditional methods. While the energy efficiency is currently too low (3.6%) for commercial use, this new process could be refined in the future, potentially slashing the cost of solar energy.|$|E
25|$|The Kalmyks {{were the}} last Mongol nomads to {{penetrate}} European territory, having migrated to Europe from Central Asia {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. In the winter of 1770–1771, approximately 200,000 Kalmyks began the journey from their pastures on the left bank of the Volga River to Dzungaria, through the territories of their Kazakh and Kyrgyz enemies. After several months of travel, <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the original group reached Dzungaria in northwest China.|$|E

25|$|Titanic had 16 sets of davits, each able {{to handle}} four {{lifeboats}}. This gave Titanic the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats {{which would have been}} enough for 4,000people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178people, <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> Titanic total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000tons to only carry 16lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.|$|E
25|$|KMSP-TV {{took over}} the ABC {{affiliation}} from WTCN-TV on April 16, 1961. Throughout its years with ABC, KMSP was notorious for having a sub-standard news department with large staff turnover. Ratings were dismal with KMSP obtaining <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the viewing audience of each of their two competitors, CBS affiliate WCCO-TV and NBC affiliate KSTP-TV. The station's transmitter was moved in 1971 to a new tower constructed by KMSP in Shoreview, while the studios and offices relocated in 1972 to Edina on York Avenue South, across from Southdale Shopping Center.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Muslim, his or her estate shall be {{distributed}} according to sharia law. This is called the Faraid or the Islamic law of Inheritance. A Muslim is allowed to make a will, called a wasiat, but <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> his estate shall be disposed of according to the will. Furthermore, the requirement under sharia law is that disposition according to wills shall not benefit any person opposed to Islam as a religion.

25|$|The club's {{board of}} {{directors}} has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. <b>Only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure {{of the terms of}} the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune {{to a lot of the}} in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, {{even the}} {{electorate}} that elected <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the deputies had a non-proportional ethnic composition. The Magyars {{who made up}} 54.5% {{of the population of}} the Kingdom of Hungary represented a 60.2% majority of the electorate. Ethnic Germans made up 10.4% of the population and 13.0% of the electorate. The participation of other ethnic groups was as follows: Slovaks (10.7% in population, 10.4% in the electorate), Romanians (16.1% in population, 9.9% in the electorate), Rusyns (2.5% in population, 1.7% in the electorate), Croats (1.1% in population, 1.0% in the electorate), Serbs (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate), and others (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate).|$|E
25|$|Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> its army {{to attack}} Serbia. After {{suffering}} heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving {{them from the}} country {{by the end of}} 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary, in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy. Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.|$|E

25|$|Labour {{has had a}} {{relatively}} high turnover of four leaders during this term in opposition, attributed in part to changes within public media and the political environment. Goff led Labour into a second electoral defeat in 2011 and was succeeded by David Shearer (2011–2013). Shearer resigned after losing the confidence of caucus. David Cunliffe (2013–2014) was elected in the subsequent leadership election. Cunliffe was disliked by some factions within the Labour caucus but had strong support from the party membership. In the leadership contest he won first-preference votes from <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> Labour MPs. Cunliffe resigned following a further election loss in 2014. He was replaced by Andrew Little (2014–2017). Little resigned in 2017 following new polling showing the party sinking to a record low result. He was replaced by Jacinda Ardern (2017–present).|$|E
25|$|In the War in Defense of the Constitution, pro-Russian {{conservative}} Polish magnates, the Confederation of Targowica, {{fought against}} Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians {{would help them}} restore the Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the Grodno Sejm, last Sejm of the Commonwealth, {{in the presence of}} the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province South Prussia, with Posen (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.|$|E
25|$|By now, the {{imminent}} threat of invasion {{had all but}} passed as the Luftwaffe had failed to gain the prerequisite air superiority. The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued {{with the objective of}} breaking the morale of the civilian population. The attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the Luftwaffes effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen moved to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. The shortage of bombers caused OKL to improvise. Some 50 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as Leichte Kampfflugzeuge ("light bombers") and sometimes called Leichte Kesselringe ("Light Kesselrings"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, <b>only</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> German bombs hit their targets.|$|E
