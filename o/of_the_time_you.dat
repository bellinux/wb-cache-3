500|$|Fey {{is known}} for her deadpan humor and delivery; her [...] "sardonic wit" [...] has become a {{trademark}} of hers, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey's work. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey [...] "project both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" [...] in her performances, while The Chronicles Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in [...] "delectable, situational and ironic comedy". On Fey's comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee [...] "has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it." [...] Michaels concluded, [...] "It's not fearful. It's strong and confident and you recognise the voice and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> agree with it." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey [...] "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that [...] "Glasses make anyone look smarter".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{welcomed the}} ability to dual-wield weapons and magic. An editor for PC PowerPlay felt that the dual-wielding ability [...] "transforms the {{tactical}} scope of each combat encounter". Shibley noted that the dual-wielding option gave the player more freedom to experiment with combat, writing that, [...] "{{the ability to}} apply a spell to each hand... generates huge potential for getting creative with your spell combinations". However, many reviewers were critical of the melee combat, feeling {{that it had not}} been improved upon as much as other areas in the game. Justin McElroy of Joystiq felt that, [...] "what should be thrilling fights in Skyrim are often weighed down by the same clunky melee system Oblivion suffered from". Onyett described the melee combat as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "floaty", and that [...] "many times it feels like you're slicing air instead of a mythical creature's flesh". Francis agreed with this sentiment, stating that, [...] "too much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits".|$|E

Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you". Benji Wilson from The Daily Telegraph also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they [...] "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an [...] "ocean-going stinker".|$|E

2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners.

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> easiest way <b>of</b> seeing this is the following: imagine that you play this game repeatedly, around 1 / 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> your first choice is right, and then you do not win the car because you change doors; in the other 2 / 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> your first choice is wrong, and changing to the door the host did not open will make you win the car.
