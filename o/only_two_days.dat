5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> {{before the opening}} of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ.

5|$|Expected to last <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees.

However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn.
