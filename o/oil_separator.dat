40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the current management of <b>oil</b> <b>separators</b> in smaller businesses in Falun municipality. Main research questions included whether the <b>oil</b> <b>separators</b> are handled properly concerning maintenance, drainage, and inspection. A number of interviews were carried out with operators of <b>oil</b> <b>separators</b> within small businesses in Falun municipality and representatives from the Swedish Professional Association STOR and Ragn-Sells. In addition, literature and public documents such as reports from Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and municipalities were compiled and evaluated. The results show that there are considerable problems with the management of <b>oil</b> <b>separators.</b> Problems are identified in all areas, ranging from deficiencies in theoretical knowledge, maintenance, drainage and inspection. Other municipalities than Falun have identified similar problems. To solve the problem regarding <b>oil</b> <b>separators,</b> operators must be more conscious about their responsibilities and the demands as a result of existing laws. Theoretical knowledge is required, but also documented information must be accessible. An increased knowledge level could be reached through increased supervision and information from municipalities and environmental administrations...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the compressor, oil {{is added to the}} refrigerant during installation or commissioning. The type of oil may be mineral or synthetic to suit the compressor type, and also chosen so as not to react with the refrigerant type and other components in the system. In small refrigeration systems the oil is allowed to circulate throughout the whole circuit, but care must be taken to design the pipework and components such that oil can drain back under gravity to the compressor. In larger more distributed systems, especially in retail refrigeration, the oil is normally captured at an <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> immediately after the compressor, and is in turn re-delivered, by an oil level management system, back to the compressor(s). Oil separators are not 100% efficient so system pipework must still be designed so that oil can drain back by gravity to the <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> or compressor.|$|E

Feedwater was taken directly from the condensate tank's hot contents rather than from the main tank's cold contents.|$|E
50|$|It is {{critical}} that {{the parts of the}} PCV system be kept clean and open, otherwise air flow will be insufficient. A plugged or malfunctioning PCV valve by itself cannot damage an engine; however the blowby will flow up in a reverse fashion up through the crankcase air inlet and if there isn't a separate catch can or <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> at that inlet, then the blowby will contaminate the air intake manifold. On boosted engines this can be a real problem. A poorly maintained engine's PCV system will eventually contaminate the air intake manifold with oil sludge and if both the pcv valve and the crankcase air inlet are blocked then the crankcase pressure will build to a level that will damage seals and eventually the motor.|$|E

As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and <b>oil</b> <b>separator.</b> The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point.

50|$|A {{primitive}} {{approach to}} condensation simply injected the spent steam into the tender tank, {{relying on the}} mass of water for cooling. More sophisticated tenders, such as those used in the South African Railways Class 25 locomotives designed for service in the Karoo, replaced most of the water tank with a huge radiator, in which the steam was cooled and condensed. Exhaust steam, after passing through an <b>oil</b> <b>separator,</b> was conveyed to the tender, where it powered a low-pressure turbine used to drive the radiator fans. The steam then passed into the radiator. The condensate was injected into the boiler with another turbine-driven pump. This was a quite complex bit of machinery, also requiring another turbine in the smokebox to provide the exhaust draft normally obtained by blowing the exhaust steam up the stack. Eventually the SAR examples were converted to conventional locomotives by replacing the radiator with a long water tank.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic <b>oil</b> <b>separator</b> box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|E
