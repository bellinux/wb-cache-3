5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
5|$|At school, Peter is {{attacked}} {{with water}} balloons by Flash Thompson and his sidekick Kenny Kong, which he dodges until he realizes it might reveal his secret identity as Spider-Man. Gwen steps in and gets everyone {{to laugh at}} Flash instead. Gwen and Peter go to the Connors lab and help Eddie clean up from a previous battle with Electro. Martha announces that Curt's arm had grown back and they celebrate until they realize scales are growing on his arm, determining that the reptilian half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> his taking over. Peter tries to comfort the Connors's son, Billy, but gets interrupted when Curt transforms into a hulking, humanoid lizard and runs off.|$|E
5|$|Canavan {{became the}} acting {{laboratory}} director at Boston Psychopathic after his death. In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries at the base <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> were small, but {{the significance of this}} finding was unclear. The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E

5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries {{to pull the plug}} on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that {{he was the one who}} put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.|$|E
5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a piece <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E
25|$|Phineas Gage, who {{suffered}} destruction {{of one or}} both frontal lobes by a projectile iron rod, is often cited as an example illustrating that the brain causes mind. Gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his accident. This physical event, the destruction of part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain,</b> therefore caused some kind of change in his mind, suggesting a correlation between brain states and mental states. Similar examples abound; neuroscientist David Eagleman describes the case of another individual who exhibited escalating pedophilic tendencies at two different times, and in each case {{was found to have}} tumors growing in a particular part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E

When the old lion roars, the young whelps growl. I growled assentingly, and the talk ran on from books in general to his own in particular.|$|R

25|$|Following Haarmann's execution, {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> {{were removed}} for forensic analysis.

25|$|Physical {{deficiencies}} {{are different}} from head trauma, because physical deficiencies lean more toward passive physical issues. Surgery that removes {{part of the brain}} is active and thus head trauma, while the surgery also causes the surrounding areas to atrophy, which is passive. Henry Molaison is an example of physical deficiencies, because parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> began to atrophy after his surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} at the Center for Bioinformatics Space Life Sciences at the NASA Ames Research Center examined Peek {{with a series of}} tests including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The intent was to create a three-dimensional view <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> structure and to compare the images to MRI scans done in 1988. These were the first tentative approaches in using non-invasive technology to further investigate Kim's savant abilities.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Page robbed, {{raped and}} killed a female student in Denver. He later {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder and was a {{candidate}} for the death penalty. Professor A. Raine from the University of Pennsylvania was an expert witness for defense and brought Page into a laboratory to assess his brain function. Brain imaging scans revealed a distinct lack of activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex. Professor Raine argued for a deep-rooted biological explanation for Mr. Page’s violence, who escaped death penalty partly on the basis <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> pathology.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1990, the IRA {{attempted}} to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one of her eyes. The couple's daughter {{was found to be}} suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets were within millimetres <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Charles Whitman, for instance, was a {{young man}} who studied {{architectural}} engineering at the University of Texas. Whitman had no history of violence or crime. As a child, he scored 138 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test, placing in the 99th percentile. He was an Eagle Scout, volunteered as a scoutmaster, and served in Marine Corps. In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his final note complained of inability to control his thoughts and requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain,</b> a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.|$|E

25|$|Michael Oft’s was {{a teacher}} in Virginia who had no prior {{psychiatric}} nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and other clients at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist advised a brain scan, which showed a tumor growing {{at the base of}} his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain.</b> After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.|$|E
25|$|After Queen Marie-Thérèse's {{death in}} 1683 and the king's secret {{marriage}} to Mme de Maintenon, devotion {{came to the}} fore at court. The king's enthusiasm for opera dissipated; he was revolted by Lully's dissolute life and homosexual encounters. In 1686, to show his displeasure, Louis XIV made a point of not inviting Lully to perform Armide at Versailles. Lully died from gangrene, having struck his foot with his long conducting staff during a performance of his Te Deum to celebrate Louis XIV's recovery from surgery. He refused to have his leg amputated so he could still dance. This resulted in gangrene propagating through his body and ultimately infecting the greater part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain,</b> causing his death. He died in Paris and was buried in the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where his tomb with its marble bust can still be seen. All three of his sons (Louis Lully, Jean-Baptiste Lully fils, and Jean-Louis Lully) had musical careers as successive surintendants of the King's Music.|$|E
25|$|Bhumibol {{was again}} {{admitted}} to Siriraj Hospital in September 2009, apparently suffering from flu and pneumonia. In 2011, {{it was revealed}} as part of WikiLeaks's leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and depression. He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012. Bhumibol suffered minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brain</b> {{for which he was}} treated in July 2012. Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013, and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013, but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015. Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015, but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months. The King temporarily left hospital to visit Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016 but returned later that day.|$|E
