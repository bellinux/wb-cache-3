5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Robert Lipton walks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> with Philip and {{he notices}} Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). Robert asks why Oscar did not call after the fundraiser and heavily hints at his {{attraction}} to Oscar, which Oscar has repeatedly suggested to be the case. Oscar appears taken aback, but flattered and tempted.|$|E

After the crowd has dispersed, Black and Surova find Medikov's body at a table, his face shot off.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} underwent major renovations and additions in 1956 and 1966 {{to accommodate}} the growing faculty (see architecture section below). In 1967, the 12inch telescope at the observatory made its last professional photometric observations. The University of Illinois' Astronomy Department moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 1979. The same year the observatory received recognition by the National Register of Historic Places, 1986, thousands gathered at the site to observe Comet Halley's journey into the inner solar system.|$|E

2500|$|Two Liberty Place {{was less}} warmly {{received}} by critics. Goldberger said {{that despite the}} similarity in appearance, Two Liberty was [...] "as much of a slab as a tower, with a spire that {{looks as if it}} was plopped awkwardly on top instead of having grown naturally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> overall form." [...] He also criticized giving One Liberty Place a smaller, similar twin which he said gives the complex an odd look.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} was confirmed, a slide was added during <b>the</b> theatre show <b>of</b> his movie Deepam which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who {{witnessed}} it with absolute shock and disbelief. A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for a genius promotion for some upcoming project.|$|R
5|$|A life-size {{sculpture}} of the {{coat of arms}} was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986. Rosen took some liberty with the design, such as adding farm tools to emphasize the city's agricultural and trading history, as well as adding previously undocumented detail; the left supporter also takes on more of the look of an explorer (e.g., Henry Hudson) than a farmer. The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan {{as part of the}} park across Broadway from the then-newly renovated Union Station, which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 2010. The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway.|$|E

Wolverine confronts Magneto, but is thrown way into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Magneto rips it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{with the intention of}} killing Nixon.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion—including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then {{compacts}} him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
5|$|Matthew died in 1973, {{sparking}} {{an internal}} conflict over who would succeed him {{as head of}} the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members locked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.|$|E
5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below the desks so Charles, who {{is sitting in the}} conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

50|$|As U.S. Army troops {{neared the}} Dachau sub-camp at Landsberg on 27 April 1945, the SS {{officer in charge}} ordered that 4,000 prisoners be murdered. Windows and doors of their huts were nailed shut. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> were then doused with {{gasoline}} and set afire. Prisoners who were naked or nearly so were burned to death, while some managed to crawl <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> before dying. Earlier that day, as Wehrmacht troops withdrew from Landsberg am Lech, towns people hung white sheets from their windows. Infuriated SS troops dragged German civilians {{from their homes and}} hanged them from trees.|$|R
5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman jumping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> onto a van {{in an attempt}} to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin {{personally}} warns the King {{about the}} plot; whereupon Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, {{to find that}} the imposter Alembick has smuggled it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to his accomplices. With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, and is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria. A letter obtained from one of the thieves, reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country. In Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. He continues to Klow on foot, and (with the help of Snowy), restores the sceptre to the King.|$|E

While there, they make a fascinating discovery that the Orb of Isis is a music box which had gone overlooked by scientists and museum staff. Lisa concludes that what her father said about risks was right– until the alarm goes off and guard dogs chase them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, an NVA {{soldier who}} {{had participated in}} the attack was interrogated by a US {{intelligence}} officer. [...] The NVA soldier, a Sapper, described the attack in precise detail, noting that, when the unit crested the hill and approached the site, USAF personnel, in uniform, ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> with M-16s, and it was clear they {{had no idea how to}} fire <b>the</b> weapons. [...] <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> USAF contingent, not all were killed; some were captured, and the NVA lieutenant leading the attack ordered the prisoners thrown over the cliff to their deaths; he also ordered <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site's communications equipment.|$|R
50|$|Another major clash {{took place}} near the Sodeco area in Achrafieh where the Christian militias fought ferociously and drove <b>the</b> Syrians <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rizk <b>Building.</b> At this time, Israel was <b>the</b> primary backer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese Front's militias.|$|R
25|$|On April 6, 2010, Arizona {{officials}} executed {{search warrants}} at governmental offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towns <b>of</b> Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah. According to one report, the warrants involved <b>the</b> misuse <b>of</b> funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department {{to be shut}} down. According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> while <b>the</b> search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow. Despite these protests, public safety {{did not appear to}} be affected, as the county law enforcement agencies involved routed calls for emergency service through the county offices. A search warrant was also executed at Jake Barlow's residence.|$|R
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Topusko, {{which was}} besieged by the Serb rebels on 28 July. The same day, heavy fighting also erupted near Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica. In Dvor, Sundać and several soldiers from his platoon {{arrived at the}} regional SAO Krajina military headquarters threatening the commanding officer, holding him responsible for losses the platoon had suffered in the fighting. The group also demanded that the authorities turn any prisoners over to them, but the demand was refused. Finally, {{they went to the}} medical centre in Dvor, where they forced eight wounded Croat civilians and two policemen, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and beat them in front of 100 onlookers. There are conflicting reports that all ten were killed, or that only an unspecified number of female patients were killed. On 29 July, the remaining Croatian civilian population in Struga, Unčani, Divuša and Golubovac Divuški accepted an offer made by the JNA to evacuate them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. When the column of evacuating civilians reached Kozibrod, the population of that village also joined them, followed by the police and ZNG troops stationed in Kozibrod. The move left the SAO Krajina and the JNA in control of the bulk of Banovina.|$|E
5|$|In 1731, the {{government}} purchased houses {{at the site}} of the present building and construction of a new building started the next year. The Sabor first met in the new building on 6 May 1737. The building was originally designed to accommodate archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, {{the government}} of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban's office, the court and the archives moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 1807, when a building across St. Mark's Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a new building at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located on a corner of the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.|$|E
50|$|But time {{began to}} run <b>out.</b> All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{materials}} had arrived during the first night, and remarkably, the spire was built during the second. It became clear to Raud that the church would be finished on the third day.|$|R
