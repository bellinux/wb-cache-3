40|$|Abstract: Software testing plays {{a crucial}} role in {{software}} development life cycle. Constantly increasing product complexities accompanied by time-to-market pressures of delivering high quality software products achieving optimum cost points bring even more focus on software testing. Usage of measurement and metrics to drive software testing endeavors effectively has been a common practice. More and more organizations have deployed comprehensive metrics programs to enable their test managers make informed decisions based on objective evidences. There are a gamut of metrics invented by the research community and a good subset of them in adoption by the software practitioner fraternity, however project managers still face challenges in applying these metrics and take optimum benefits out of this adoption. Given that every project and program has its own environmental characteristics, metrics adoption needs to be viewed in a project-specific environmental context. Moreover, the interpretation of metrics cannot be done in isolation and needs to be taken in conjunction with other associated metrics. Decisions taken based on individual metrics in isolation are likely to be misleading and sub-optimum. Though the literature has been full of varied kinds of metrics, practical guidelines towards adoption of these metrics are not available in a systematic form as a consolidated <b>one-stop-shop</b> <b>solution.</b> There is a need to devise a guidance framework or a recommendation model for metrics adoption that projec...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a view of}} the changing structure of corporate R&D in telecommunications - one that is close to Adam Smith's insightful and enduring idea of division of labor - that perhaps we are witnessing the beginnings of vertical disintegration and unbundling of important segments of the industry's R&D activity. The paper maintains that the emergence of an independent software industry - aided by the convergence of computer, telecommunications and imaging technologies - and the rapid growth of technology-based alliances {{are at the heart of}} this trend. So extensive is the vertical disintegration of R&D that, in 1997, the top 10 independent software vendors in the US spent more on R&D than the combined spending by AT&T and Lucent whose sales were well over three times as large. It appears that the source of future innovation in the telecommunications industry lies not in its services segment but rather in telecommunications and Internet equipment firms and independent software firms. Increasingly, the fortunes of large service providers like AT&T will depend less on innovation and more on their ability to configure and market complete <b>one-stop-shopping</b> <b>solutions</b> to customers by combining internal resources with outsourced technologies, products and services.

40|$|SMEs {{in need of}} {{computational}} resources exceeding {{their own}} capacity tend to use public Cloud infrastructures. The main reasons being expected lower costs than those of an own infrastructure and an increased flexibility when scaling the number of computing resources. Applications often are web-servers, shops, back-ends for mobile apps etc. SMEs running industrial simulation codes on Cloud resources can be observed less frequently. Three reasons can be identified: (i) industrial simulation codes are complex and the learning curve is rather steep than flat. (ii) The simulation codes are often designed for parallel execution in HPC environments. (iii) Industrial simulation codes are protected by software licenses that in general are tailored for executing the simulation locally. The European funded Fortissimo project aims at supporting SMEs {{when they need to}} perform simulations using HPC Cloud resources. To achieve this goal Fortissimo executes three sets of 20 experiments where Independent Software Vendors, Cloud Providers, SMEs and experts work together implementing and testing a one-stop-shop for SMEs that delivers computational resources, applications and the corresponding software licenses in an integrated way. This paper describes how the MORE. CLOUD experiment, one of the first 20 Fortissimo experiments, is achieving the goal of realizing this one-stop-shop for the involved SME and its applications, together with an ISV. First the SME initial situation is described, identifying the opportunities and benefits. Then the situation of the ISV with respect to changing requirement of its customers and new business opportunities in Cloud computing is presented. Furthermore, the paper introduces the software licensing technology needed to support both SME and ISV and the extensions developed to make the <b>one-stop-shop</b> a viable <b>solution</b> for all parties involved...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary Internet-based and {{wireless}} technologies enable the main {{requirements for the}} provision of mobility services. Having identified the operational and business-related requirements resulting from the state-of-the-art analysis done within Work Package 3, Deliverable 5 highlights technological aspects including potentials and opportunities to be considered for the deployment of MaaS. Based on expert interviews, together with literature findings, a detailed analysis of required technologies for MaaS was conducted. As the deployment of MaaS strongly relies on the provision of ICT technologies, the main focus within this deliverable was placed on related requirements, although user requirements (e. g. usability aspects and service design) were also discussed. Already employed technologies within MaaS and MaaS-related services were identified. All technology-related findings helped to develop a comprehensive MaaS system architecture, presented in this deliverable. Required technologies along the value chain starting from data generation up to the final end-user service provision are studied in more detail. For instance the provision and integration of different mobility data sources open the way towards high quality MaaS systems. Therefore access to data is a main requirement presented in this document that highlights several state-of-the-art strategies. ‘Open’ data market places and the harmonized deployment of data standards are enablers for MaaS services, to mention but a few. Going one step further in the value chain, integrated service provision requires a comprehensive analysis of existing technical solutions, approaching the conceptual idea of implementing the <b>one-stop-shop</b> principle. Technical <b>solutions</b> that are already mature and would give a major added value to MaaS service generation are analysed and reviewed in this document. This includes for instance the idea of interlinking different services by their subscriptions, supporting the provision of open application interfaces to developers and/or using common web-service standards simplifying the processes of integrating and combining different proprietary services. Beside the elaboration of the MaaS system architecture and its technical requirements, the use of wireless networks as infrastructural requirements for MaaS allowing the seamless accessibility to mobility services is analysed. Both advantages and disadvantages in terms of availability for MaaS within different regions are discussed. For instance, new telecommunication technologies, like 5 G, enabling an even higher quality service experience to users (based on e. g. higher data rates), seem to be promising for the extensive use of MaaS. Since mobile telecommunication provides an enabling key technology allowing individual access to information and digital services, new opportunities for digital transport service provision are highlighted. Both the telecommunication and transport industries show similar characteristics in approaching linking cross-border transport and mobile network services. In this respect, roaming requirements use other ‘foreign’ transport but also telecom providers, here discussed in the MaaS context. An overview of prevailing technologies relevant for MaaS, dealing with data, service but also wireless network requirements, is presented. Wherever information could be derived from the state-of-the-art analyses, key technologies were assessed and opportunities highlighted. In the final part of deliverable 5, recommendations derived from the resulting technology requirements are presented. Based on the main requirement issues, recommendations can be used as supporting implementation guidance for stakeholders, clustered into the following themes: Open Data-related specifications, Wireless Communication networks, Standardisation/Regulation/Management requirements and Licensing...|$|R
