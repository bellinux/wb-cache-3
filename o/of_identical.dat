5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} {{genetics}} of schizophrenia {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> twins such as the Minnesota Study <b>of</b> <b>Identical</b> Twins Reared Apart.|$|E

5|$|After Zobel {{arrived at}} the Engineering Department of AT he used his {{mathematical}} skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters {{now known as the}} image method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> sections.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{comparison}} is given between two conditions {{used to define}} logical constants: Belnap's uniqueness and Hacking's deducibility <b>of</b> <b>identicals.</b> It is shown that, in spite of some surface similarities, there is a deep difference between them. On the one hand, deducibility <b>of</b> <b>identicals</b> {{turns out to be}} a weaker and less demanding condition than uniqueness. On the other hand, deducibility <b>of</b> <b>identicals</b> is shown to be more faithful to the inferentialist perspective, permitting definition of genuinely proof-theoretical concepts. This kind of analysis is driven by exploiting the Curry–Howard correspondence. In particular, deducibility <b>of</b> <b>identicals</b> is shown to correspond to the computational property of eta expansion, which is essential in the characterization of propositional identity...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E

5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E

Miroslava Vavrinec retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury 7 years before she married Federer. They were married at Wenkenhof Villa in Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by {{a small group of}} close friends and family. In July 2009, Mirka gave birth to identical twin girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva. The Federers had another pair <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> twins in 2014, this time boys whom they named Leo and Lennart (known as Lenny).|$|E

5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, {{have more than}} 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E
5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published.|$|E

5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> ("hard-rhyme") {{or similar}} ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain <b>of</b> <b>identical</b> filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E
