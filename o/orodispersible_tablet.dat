Results: The tablet formulation containing 16 % w/w treated agar, 15 % w/w sodium bicarbonate and 15 % w/w tartaric acid emerged as the overall best formulation (with an in vitro dispersion time of approximately 55 s, t 50 % = 9. 24 min and t 70 % = 18. 12 min), based on the in vitro drug release characteristics, compared to commercial conventional tablet formulation (which shows 16. 48 and 29. 24 min respectively for t 50 % and t 70 %). Short-term stability studies (at 40 ± 2 o/ 75 ± 5 % relative umidity) on the best formulation indicated that there are no ignificant changes in drug content and in vitro dispersion time p< 0. 05). IR-spectroscopic studies indicated that there are nodrug–excipient interactions. Conclusions: The present study clearly demonstrates that <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> of diethylcarbamazine citrate could be successfully prepared by direct compression method in a cost effective manner employing treated agar. The use of effervescent mixture further assists in taste masking. Undoubtedly the availability of various technologies and the manifold advantages of <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> will surely enhance the patient compliance providing rapid onset of action...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ofloxacin is an {{antibacterial}} agent {{used to treat}} infections. It is extremely bitter in taste and taste should be masked to formulate it in a palatable form. The purpose of present research work was to formulate tasteless complexes of ofloxacin with indion 204 ion exchange resin. The drug loading onto ion-exchange resin was optimized for mixing time, activation, effect of pH, mode of mixing, ratio of drug: resin and temperature. The resinate was evaluated for taste masking and in vitro drug release. DSC analysis study supported complex formation. ofloxacin- indion 204 complex of ratio 1 : 1. 5 was developed into <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> using different superdisintegrants with varying concentration and was evaluated for weight variation, hardness, friability, wetting time, water absorption ratio, content uniformity, disintegration time and dissolution and was found superior over conventional formulation. The F 5 batch with disintegration time 19. 33 Sec ± 3. 78 and dissolution within 45 minutes 89. 642 ± 2. 20 was selected as optimized formulation. By an appropriate selection and combination of excipients, {{it was possible to}} obtain orodispersible and taste masked tablets.

40|$|In {{the present}} study strong cation {{exchange}} resin (Amberlite IRP 69) was used to improve the physicochemical properties of ranitidine hydrochloride such as taste and bulk properties and to sustain dissolution rate. Drug-resin complexes were prepared using batch method. Drug loading was done under different processing conditions such as temperature, pH, drug-resin ratio, and drug concentration to get the optimum condition for resinate preparation. Resinate prepared under optimized condition was tested for taste, bulk properties and release rate. Degree of bitterness of ranitidine was found to reduce to zero after complexation with resin. Improvement in flow properties was also observed. Angle of repose for resinate {{was found to be}} 33. 21 o as compared to 42. 27 o for ranitidine HCl. Effect of dissolution medium and particle size on in vitro release of drug from resinate was also investigated. Resinate with drug to resin ratio of 2 : 3 and particle size&# 62; 90 &#x 00 B 5;m showed about 90 &#x 0025; of drug release within 12 h. The <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> formulated from the resinate containing 10 &#x 0025; croscarmellose sodium disintegrated within 35 sec in oral cavity and showed similar dissolution profile as the resinate.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare patients’ {{preference}} for olanzapine <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> (ODT) with oral conventional tablet (OCT). Methods. A 12 -week randomized, crossover, multinational, open-label study was conducted to estimate the proportion of patients preferring ODT or OCT. Outpatients with stable schizophrenia on OCT monotherapy were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to ODT or OCT. Compliance and drug attitude were measured using the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI- 10) and Medication Adherence Form (MAF) scales; tolerability and safety by Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP- 5) questionnaire and adverse event summary. Results. A total of 175 patients answered a preference question: 106 (61 %) preferred ODT and 48 (27 %) preferred OCT (P< 0. 001 adjusted for treatment sequence); 21 (12 %) expressed no preference. There was no significant change in DAI- 10 with either formulation. MAF was above 75 % in 94 % vs. 93 % of patients on ODC and OCT, respectively. Compliance as measured by tablet count was above 98 % on both formulations. The adverse event profiles did not differ between formulations. Mean weight increase over 6 weeks on ODT was 0. 8 kg and on OCT was 0. 6 kg. Conclusions. Given the importance of patients’ preference for treatment planning and success, the ODT formulation should be routinely considered as a treatment option...|$|E

40|$|Disintegrants are an {{essential}} component to tablet formulations. While rapidly disintegrating tablets do not necessarily ensure fast bioavailability, slowly disintegrating tablets almost always assure slow bioavailability. The ability to interact strongly with water is essential to disintegrant function. Combinations of swelling and/or wicking and/or deformation are the mechanisms of disintegrant action. Super disintegrants offer significant improvements over starch. But hygroscopicity may {{be a problem in}} some formulations. Tablet disintegration has received considerable attention as {{an essential}} step in obtaining fast drug release. Disintegration remains a powerful influence and precursor for drug absorption. Disintegration of tablet or capsule is depending upon the type and quantity of disintegrants. The development of <b>Orodispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> provides an opportunity to take an account of tablet disintegrants. Therefore, there is a huge potential for the evaluation of new disintegrants or modification of an existing disintegrants into superdisintegrants, so as to formulate <b>Orodispersible</b> <b>tablets.</b> The present study comprises the various kinds of disintegrants and superdisintegrants, which are being used in the formulation to provide the safer, effective drug delivery with patient's compliance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to formulate and optimize an orodispersible formulation of meloxicam using a 22 factorial design for enhanced bioavailability. Methods: The tablets were made by non-aqueous wet granulation using crospovidone and mannitol. A 22 factorial design was used to investigate the amount of crospovidone and taste masking, soothening hydrophilic agent (mannitol), as independent variables, and disintegration time as dependent response. Formulated <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated for weight variation, friability, disintegration time, drug content, wetting time, water absorption ratio and in vitro drug release. Results: The results show that the presence of a superdisintegrant and mannitol is desirable for orodispersion. All the formulations satisfied the limits of orodispersion with a dispersion time of less than 60 sec. For example, formulation F 4 showed a disintegration time of 32. 1 sec, crushing strength of 4. 93 kg/cm 2, drug content of 98. 5 % and fast drug release rate of 99. 5 % within 30 min, as compared with the conventional tablet (49. 5 %). Conclusion: It is feasible to formulate <b>orodispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> of meloxican with acceptable disintegration time, rapid drug release and good hardness, which could be amenable to replication on an industrial scale...|$|R
