40|$|Multiphase flows are {{of great}} {{interest}} to a large variety of industries because flows of two or more immiscible liquids are encountered in a diverse range of processes and equipment. However, the advent of high viscosity oil requires more investigations to enhance good design of transportation system and forestall its inherent production difficulties. Experimental and numerical studies were conducted on water-sand, oil-water and oilwater- sand respectively in 1 -in ID 5 m long horizontal pipe. The densities of CYL 680 and CYL 1000 oils employed are 917 and 916. 2 kg/m 3 while their viscosities are 1. 830 and 3. 149 Pa. s @ 25 oC respectively. The solid-phase concentration ranged from 2. 15 e- 04 to 10 %v/v with mean diameter of 150 micron and material density of 2650 kg/m 3. Experimentally, the observed flow patterns are Water Assist Annular (WA-ANN), Dispersed Oil in Water (DOW/OF), <b>Oil</b> <b>Plug</b> in Water (OPW/OF) with oil film on the wall and Water Plug in Oil (WPO). These configurations were obtained through visualisation, trend and the probability density function (PDF) of pressure signals along with the statistical moments. Injection of water to assist high viscosity oil transport reduced the pressure gradient by an order of magnitude. No {{significant differences were found between}} the gradients of oil-water and oil-water-sand, however, increase in sand concentration led to increase in the pressure losses in oil-water-sand flow. Numerically, Water Assist Annular (WA-ANN), Dispersed Oil in Water (DOW/OF), <b>Oil</b> <b>Plug</b> in Water (OPW/OF) with oil film on the wall, and Water Plug in Oil (WPO) flow pattern were successfully obtained by imposing a concentric inlet condition at the inlet of the horizontal pipe coupled with a newly developed turbulent kinetic energy budget equation coded as user defined function which was hooked up to the turbulence models.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate the restart behaviour of pipeline containing gelled waxy oil. The model {{takes into account the}} compressible, multi-phase and multi-plug flow characteristics of the gelled oil at start-up. The pipe is initially filled by the gelled oil in the form of plugs separated by pockets of gas. Displacement of the gelled oil is achieved by pumping in another fluid under constant applied pressure. The simulation results obtained show that the initial gas pressure and the location of the gas segment influence the flow of the downstream <b>oil</b> <b>plug,</b> but has little effect on the flow of the upstream oil flow and the clearance time. The length of the gas section has different effects on the oil flow rates and clearance time depending on the initial liquid hold up present in the pipe. The model is robust and insensitive to the specific constitutive model assumed for the gelled oil. It appears to produce a more realistic prediction of the restart flow than other previous models based on restrictive and simplified assumptions. Malcolm R. Davidson, Q.

Among them, paraffins are considered as a major challenge, especially for the upstream petroleum industry. The solubility of high-molecular paraffins is strongly related to the temperature. With the decreasing temperature, these paraffins tend to precipitate and form stable wax crystals. The wax crystals will deposit on the pipe wall and/or transport with fluids, which would reduce the flowability of crude <b>oils</b> and <b>plug</b> pipelines or seize equipments, leading to costly downtime and expensive remediation techniques (Bacon et al. 2010; Bello et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{simulation}} Toolbox, exclusively {{designed for}} the analysis of different experimental setups for in-situ combustion (ISC) analysis, was developed. This Toolbox can be targeted {{for the analysis of}} chemical kinetics. The models in the Toolbox are based on fundamental conservation laws, physical correlations for porous media properties and property databases available in the open literature. The Toolbox, written in Matlab, is coupled to CANTERA, a software for the analysis of complex chemical mechanisms and thermodynamics for gas phase reactions. The toolbox considers three main applications: kinetic cell, plug flow reactor and combustion tube. Each one {{can be applied to the}} analysis of different issues in ISC experiments, as illustrated throughout the thesis. The kinetic cell module, as its name indicates, is particularly suitable for the analysis of these experimental setups. It includes the ability to follow gas phase reactions. This module is used with the GRI-Mech 3. 0, a complex reaction mechanism originally designed to model natural gas combustion, that includes 325 reactions and 53 species to address the existence of CO oxidation in the gas phase of ISC experiments. The plug flow reactor module, modeled as a series of kinetic cells, simplifies computation and is suitable for the design of experiments that reduce the existence of concentration gradients in a kinetic cell. The last module can model a combustion tube including Darcy's flow and fundamentals of flow in porous media. It captures important phenomena such as <b>oil</b> <b>plugging</b> as it includes pressure balance, based on volume conservation principles and thermodynamic relations. The analysis with these three modules represents an ideal complement to reservoir modeling software that, while suitable for the study of oil production in field has not been {{designed for the}} complex processes that take place in in-situ combustion experiment...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{approaches}} to capillary liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to multi-stage mass spectrometry (MSn) {{were developed to}} determine endogenous neuropeptides in microdialysis samples. Important factors including sample stability, detection sensitivity, reproducibility and system robustness have been examined and improved. The method was tested for 10 different neuropeptides with limits of detection (LODs) from 0. 5 pM to 60 pM for most. β-endorphin could be quantitatively determined with enhanced sensitivity by detecting a characteristic peptide produced by tryptic digestion. Quantitative determination of the peptides using external calibration was verified. In this study, the temporal resolution during detection was improved from over 20 min to 5 min. To avoid poor reproducibility caused by {{the reduction of the}} sampling time of each fraction, isotopically labeled leu-enkephalin (LE) was added as an internal standard. Relative standard deviation (RSD) for in vivo dialysates measurement was reduced from over 30 % to ~ 10 %. By lowering the temporal resolution by a factor of four, larger LE concentration changes in the striatum of rat brain were observed upon perfusion of 75 mM K+ solution. Another novel approach to the capillary LC-MS system was fraction generation using a 100 µm i. d. Tee junction. With this approach, chemically separated components were preserved as nanoliter plugs and than analyzed off-line on a mass spectrometer. At optimal ESI voltage and a flow rate range from 20 to 2000 nL/min, aqueous <b>plugs</b> in <b>oil</b> segmented flow underwent ESI while <b>oil</b> <b>plugs</b> were dripped off the emitter tip or extracted through hydrophobic Teflon tubing at higher flow rate.

An application of the system was shown to be in vivo monitoring of opioid peptide following acute injection of amphetamine. Enkephalins were measured both at basal level and after drug administration, revealing a substantial release of the peptides in rat brain. This dynamic change was dose dependent.

30|$|One {{fundamental}} {{reason for}} a decline in oil production with time is the existence of fractures and permeability variations that exist between the different layers of the reservoir.

Vegetable oil has cetane number about 35 to 40 depending upon the composition where as diesel fuel have a cetane number around 45. certain functional groups and poor volatility isresponsible of their comparatively low cetane number. Vegetable oil and diesel differs greatly in other properties. Their kinematic viscosity is several times greater than for diesel oil the high viscosity of vegetable oils lead to pumping and atomization problems in the normal diesel fuel injection system, which creates filterplugging and cold starting high carbon residue causes heavy smoke emission and carbon deposition on the injection nozzle tips and in the combustion chamber. There are also problems of incompatibility with engine lubricants. The poor volatibility makes vegetable oil difficult to vaporize and ignite, this leads to thermal cracking resulting in heavy smoke emission and carbon deposition in the combustion chamber.
