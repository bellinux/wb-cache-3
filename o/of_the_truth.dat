5|$|The {{full name}} of the Church is Iglesia del Dios Vivo Columna y Apoyo de la Verdad, La Luz del Mundo ("Church of the Living God, Column and Support <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Truth,</b> The Light of The World") which is derived from two {{passages}} in the Bible, Matthew 5:14 and 1 Timothy 3:15.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of the Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain {{wrote of}} the creature's existence in the early seventeenth century. However, no concrete evidence of such writings has been uncovered, even though Champlain did write of loud screams from sea monsters living in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.|$|E
5000|$|Conditional {{statements}} may be nested {{such that}} {{either or both}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antecedent or the consequent may themselves be conditional statements. In the example , meaning [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> p implies <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> q, then <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> r implies <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> s), both <b>the</b> antecedent and the consequent are conditional statements.|$|R

5|$|The Telugu {{version of}} the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses, while the {{shortest}} surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses. Both versions open by hailing Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme Purusha or supreme spirit, the great Yogin, the Supreme Being, the great Tapasvin (meditator), and a lamp in the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> This links the text to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By August, Lucien, his {{children}} and Dermide had all suffered from bouts of fever. Doctors saw no cause for alarm and Lucien quickly recovered, as did {{his children}}. Despite the doctors' best efforts, Dermide died on 14 August, {{at the age of}} six. Pauline later came to believe her son's blood had been thinned by the recurrent spells of yellow fever they had suffered in Saint-Domingue. Borghese decided to conceal Dermide's death from his wife until her health improved. Thus, Francesco returned to Frascati and wrote three letters addressed to Pauline: one which announced the onset of Dermide's illness, the second announcing that the illness worsened and the third announcing Dermide's demise. Immediately after receiving the first letter, Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa, in order to reach her son at Frascati. Before this was possible, she became aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and her suspicions were confirmed by de la Ronde.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully is intrigued after a young boy with cancer, whose parents don’t believe in medical treatment because it is against God’s will, recovers miraculously. What she soon discovers is that his cure is not miraculous, but scientific. Eager, if wary, to learn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> behind his secrets, Scully agrees to travel with the Smoking Man to get the cure to all mankind’s diseases.|$|E

5|$|When Rommel {{was seriously}} wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry {{undertook}} efforts {{to conceal the}} injury {{so as not to}} undermine domestic morale. Despite this, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 August. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy X-2, set {{two years}} after Final Fantasy X, Yuna {{is a member of}} the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's {{international}} version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In X-2, Yuna journeys to Spira in search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again.|$|E
