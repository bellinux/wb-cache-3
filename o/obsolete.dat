5|$|Georgian scripts {{are unique}} in their {{appearance}} and their exact origin {{has never been}} established; however, in strictly structural terms, their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, {{with the exception of}} letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are currently <b>obsolete</b> in that language. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. The Mingrelian language uses 36, 33 of which are current Georgian letters, one <b>obsolete</b> Georgian letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan. That same <b>obsolete</b> letter, plus a letter borrowed from Greek (making 35 letters total), are used in writing the Laz language. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional <b>obsolete</b> Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels.|$|E
