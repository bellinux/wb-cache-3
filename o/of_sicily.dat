5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced {{the threat of}} a Latin crusade to reclaim the city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Sicily,</b> first under Manfred <b>of</b> <b>Sicily</b> (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), who quickly established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist. Countering the Angevin ruler's alliances and efforts to conquer Byzantium would occupy the remainder of Michael VIII's reign.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{a revolt}} against Angevin rule, {{known as the}} Sicilian Vespers, threw off Charles of Anjou's rule of the island <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> The Angevins managed to {{maintain}} control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Sicily,</b> although it is {{commonly referred to as}} the Kingdom of Naples, after its capital. The island became a separate kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.|$|E

The fortifications of Mdina were rebuilt and modified {{a number of times}} over the following centuries. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati or the castrum civitas was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, probably on the site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429.|$|E
5|$|On his {{northern}} frontier Manuel expended considerable {{effort to}} preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Frederick, the Kingdom was ruled by HenryVII of Germany and ConradIV of Germany. The next {{legitimate}} heir was ConradII, who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred <b>of</b> <b>Sicily,</b> the illegitimate son of Frederick, took the power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, the Kingdom managed to defend its possessions, but the Papacy declared the Kingdom escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext he came to an agreement with LouisIX, King of France. Louis's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in the Kingdom, paid {{a portion of the}} papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion and {{the death of}} Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.|$|E
5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari.

Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E

5|$|During the 820s, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire had {{suffered}} two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: {{the beginning of}} the Muslim conquest <b>of</b> <b>Sicily</b> and the fall of Crete to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an era where Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of Crete, which became a haven for Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their—albeit partial—control <b>of</b> <b>Sicily</b> allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake Crete {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses.|$|E

The resulting Mafia contacts were also used by the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) – the wartime predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) – during the invasion <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> Later, the alliance was maintained in order to check the growing strength of the Italian Communist party on the island.|$|E
