40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to carcinogens {{are estimated to}} cause over 5, 000 new cases of cancer in Australia each year • Approximately 3. 6 million Australians could be exposed {{to one or more}} carcinogens at work • Priority carcinogens applicable to the Australian industrial profile should be the focus of scientists and regulators • The number of <b>occupationally</b> <b>caused</b> <b>cancers</b> compensated each year equates to less than eight percent of the expected number • Under-compensation may be a result of lack of awareness of occupational risk factors among workers and health professionals, along with the inherent difficulties in assigning a specific cancer case to an occupational cause This monograph has been developed by Cancer Council Western Australia with special acknowledgement to Terry Slevin and Lauren Zappa and contributions fro...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{information on}} the areas of scientific research, surveillance, and related studies in which NIOSH is working. The report highlights work being done {{in the areas of}} <b>occupationally</b> <b>caused</b> lung diseases, <b>cancer,</b> cardiovascular diseases, reproductive disorders, nervous system disorders, hearing loss, skin problems, psychological distress, musculoskeletal injuries, and severe traumatic injuries. Specific projects are also discussed and classified according to the division of NIOSH under which they fall (biomedical and behavioral science; physical sciences and engineering; respiratory disease; standards development and technology transfer; surveillance, hazard evaluations and field studies; safety research, and training and manpower development). A change or adjustment in the vision of NIOSH is briefly discussed as the Institute moves into the 1990 s.

40|$|Formaldehyde {{has been}} shown to <b>cause</b> nasal <b>cancer</b> in rats exposed by inhalation. Neoplasia did not develop at {{locations}} distant from sites of initial contact, a finding consistent with the chemical's high reactivity and rapid detoxification. The recently published report of the Consensus Workshop on Formaldehyde, however, drew particular attention to small excesses of malignant brain tumors and leukemia among causes of death in several groups of professionals in the U. S. and U. K. who use formaldehyde to preserve human tissues (1). Despite deficits of these diseases in mortality studies of formaldehyde-exposed industrial workers from the same countries, the report implied that the excesses of brain cancer and leukemia in the professional groups may have been <b>occupationally</b> <b>caused...</b>|$|R
