25|$|The nodes are {{points at}} which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. The Moon crosses the same node every 27.2122 days, an {{interval}} called the draconic or draconitic month. The line of nodes, the intersection between the two respective planes, has a retrograde motion: for an observer on Earth it rotates westward along the ecliptic with a period of 18.60 years, or 19.3549° per year. When viewed from celestial north, the nodes move clockwise around Earth, opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the Sun. Lunar and solar eclipses can occur when the nodes align with the Sun, roughly every 173.3 days. Lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> also determines eclipses; shadows cross when nodes coincide with full and new moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in three dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The lander {{separated}} from the orbiter on September 3, 1976 at 22:37:50 UT and landed at Utopia Planitia. Normal operations called for the structure connecting the orbiter and lander (the bioshield) to be ejected after separation, but because of problems with the separation the bioshield was left attached to the orbiter. The <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> was raised to 75 degrees on 30 September 1976.|$|E
50|$|The PAGEOS {{spacecraft}} {{was placed}} into a polar <b>orbit</b> (<b>inclination</b> 85-86°) with {{a height of}} approx. 4000 km, which had gradually lowered during its 9 years of operation.

40|$|The optimum set of <b>orbit</b> <b>inclinations</b> for the {{measurement}} of the earth radiation budget from spacially integrating sensor systems was estimated for two and three satellite systems. The best set of the two were satellites at <b>orbit</b> <b>inclinations</b> of 80 deg and 50 deg; of three the inclinations were 80 deg, 60 deg and 50 deg. These were chosen {{on the basis of}} a simulation of flat plate and spherical detectors flying over a daily varying earth radiation field as measured by the Nimbus 3 medium resolution scanners. A diurnal oscillation was also included in the emitted flux and albedo to give a source field as realistic as possible. Twenty three satellites with different inclinations and equator crossings were simulated, allowing the results of thousand of multisatellite sets to be intercompared. All were circular orbits of radius 7178 kilometers...|$|R
50|$|A {{satellite}} is said {{to occupy}} an inclined orbit around Earth if the orbit exhibits an angle other than 0° to the equatorial plane.

50|$|The Moon's {{orbit of}} the earth (shown dotted) is {{inclined}} at an angle of i = 5.14° {{in relation to the}} ecliptic. The Moon completes one revolution around the Earth in 27.32166 days. The two points at which Moon crosses the ecliptic are known as the nodes, shown as N1 and N2, and the line connecting them is known as the line of nodes. Due to precession of lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination,</b> these crossing points, the nodes and the positions of eclipses, slowly move around the ecliptic in a period of 18.59992 years.|$|E

The main functional addition to IMP versions designed for Soyuz was the ability to manually change the <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination.</b> On Vostok and Voskhod, the inclination to the equator had been constant at 65 degrees by virtue of the booster design limitations and the geographical location of the Baikonur Cosmodrome from which every Soviet and Russian manned mission had been launched to date, so {{there was no need to}} implement inclination modulation into versions 1 to 4 of the IMP.|$|E

Along with Marisat F2, GOES 3 and LES-9, it was {{one of a number of}} satellites that were transferred to the US National Science Foundation for communications with the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. After Marisat was retired, TDRS-1 became the primary means of communication with the research station.

5000|$|The {{preceding}} {{discussion has}} primarily {{focused on the}} case where the transfer between LEO and GEO is done with a single intermediate transfer orbit. More complicated trajectories are sometimes used. For example, the Proton-M uses a set of three intermediate orbits, requiring five upper-stage rocket firings, to place a satellite into GEO from the high-inclination site of Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan. [...] Because of Baikonur's high latitude and range safety considerations that block launches directly east, it requires less delta-v to transfer satellites to GEO by using a supersynchronous transfer orbit where the apogee (and the maneuver to reduce the transfer <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination)</b> are at a higher altitude than 35,786 km, the geosynchronous altitude. Proton even offers to perform a supersynchronous apogee maneuver up to fifteen hours after launch.|$|E
50|$|The Moon's maximum {{and minimum}} {{declination}} also vary because {{the plane of}} the Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined by about 5.14° to the ecliptic ({{the plane of the}} Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the direction of lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of the Earth's axis. As a consequence, the maximum declination of the Moon varies from roughly (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°. As a result, at minor lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +18.5° to −18.5°, which is a total movement of 37°. Then, 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +28.5° to −28.5°, which is a total movement of 57°, which is enough to take its culmination from high in the sky to low on the horizon in just two weeks (half an orbit).|$|E
50|$|Later {{observations}} in September 2005 with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed {{the determination of}} an orbit. Apart from data in infobox, the inclination {{was found to be}} 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards (β, λ) = (+55°, 75°). Given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla, one can say that the <b>orbit's</b> <b>inclination</b> is less than 10°.|$|R
30|$|The Swarm mission, which {{consists}} of three identical satellites, was launched on November 2013 by the European Space Agency (ESA) with the objective to perform the best-ever survey of the geomagnetic and electric fields surrounding the Earth (Friis-Christensen et al. 2006). The three satellites fly on almost polar <b>orbits</b> (<b>inclination</b> being around 88 ^∘) and are equipped with identical magnetometers and electric field instruments capable of providing high-precision and high-resolution measurements.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing for {{a wider range of}} initial <b>orbit</b> <b>inclinations,</b> low-latitude launch sites offer the benefit of requiring less energy to make orbit (at least for prograde orbits, which comprise the vast majority of launches), due to the initial velocity provided by the Earth's rotation. The desire for equatorial launch sites, coupled with geopolitical and logistical realities, has fostered the development of floating launch platforms, most notably Sea Launch.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} circled Mars {{once every}} 117.65 minutes {{at an average}} altitude of 378 km. It is in a near polar <b>orbit</b> (<b>inclination</b> = 93°) which is almost perfectly circular, moving from being over the south pole to being over the north pole in just under an hour. The altitude was chosen to make the orbit Sun-synchronous, so that all images that were taken by the spacecraft of the same surface features on different dates were taken under identical lighting conditions. After each orbit, the spacecraft viewed the planet 28.62° to the west because Mars had rotated underneath it. In effect, it was always 14:00 for Mars Global Surveyor as it moved from one time zone to the next exactly {{as fast as the}} Sun. After seven sols and 88 orbits, the spacecraft would approximately retrace its previous path, with an offset of 59 km to the east. This ensured eventual full coverage of the entire surface.|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of ballistic planetary trajectories {{is developed}} which includes constraints on departure parking <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> and node.

An additional Delta V is also defined to allow for possible optimization of parking <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> when the launch vehicle orbit capability varies as a function of parking <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination.</b> The optimization problem is formulated using primer vector theory to derive partial derivatives of total Delta V with respect to possible free parameters. Minimization of total Delta V is accomplished using a quasi-Newton gradient search routine. The analysis is applied to an Eros rendezvous mission whose transfer trajectories are characterized by high values of launch asymptote declination during particular launch opportunities. Comparisons in performance are made between trajectories where parking orbit constraints are included in the optimization and trajectories where the constraints are not included...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly solar sailing is {{perceived}} as a practical means of spacecraft propulsion. This paper concentrates on further understanding the orbital dynamics of a solar sail in a planet-centred environment, explaining and investigating the seasonal variations encountered when using a solar sail to perform orbit manoeuvres at Earth and Mercury. Solar sail performance is shown to depend on <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination,</b> with the optimal inclination achieved when placing the orbit within the ecliptic plane. When the orbit plane is not coincident with the ecliptic plane the loss of optimality is shown to generate an out-of-orbit-plane force when attempting to follow a locally optimal energy gain control law. The variation of escape time with initial <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> is calculated and confirmed to decrease as sail acceleration increases. The method of variation of sail performance with <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> explains the increasing loss of optimality between locally optimal and globally optimal trajectories previously found as <b>orbit</b> <b>inclination</b> is increased, it also explains the variation in escape times found between July and December launches, due to the difference in orbit alignment with the ecliptic plane. Mercury escape times are investigated for start epochs throughout the Hermian year and shown to vary significantly. The variation {{is directly related to the}} highly eccentric nature of Mercury's orbit, however the optimal launch date at Mercury is not directly related and varies with sail characteristic acceleration. Additionally, the time difference between maximum and minimum escape times was also considered and found to never exceed half a Hermian year, thus showing while the variation in escape time is substantial, the optimal start epoch for an escape trajectory to minimise Julian date at point of escape is always the present point in time...|$|E
