5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities <b>of</b> <b>decency</b> but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E
25|$|The Court was {{determined}} to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's {{cruel and unusual punishment}} clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be cruel and unusual, it must still be carried out {{in a manner consistent with}} the evolving standards <b>of</b> <b>decency</b> that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards <b>of</b> <b>decency</b> could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.|$|E

25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards <b>of</b> <b>decency,</b> why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) be the ones to have the final say over its interpretation? Is not the legislative branch which is elected, thereby more likely {{to be in touch with}} the current standards <b>of</b> <b>decency,</b> and therefore better placed to make such judgments? If originalism is wrong, then Marbury v. Madison—which holding underpins judicial review of constitutionality, that is, the meaning of the constitution—was wrongly decided, and two centuries of jurisprudence relying on it is thereby on shaky ground.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, he cosponsored the Federal Marriage Amendment to the United States Constitution. If it {{had been}} ratified, it would have {{declared}} that marriage in the United States only consists of the union {{of a man and}} a woman, and would have prohibited state and the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and same-sex domestic partnerships. On March 11 of that year, he introduced the Broadcast Decency Responsibility and Enforcement Act, that would have created a Council <b>of</b> <b>Decency</b> to advise the Federal Communications Commission on standards <b>of</b> <b>decency</b> in broadcasting. The Council would have consisted of three individuals from the ministry, three broadcast industry representatives, and three school teachers. The money from penalties from obscene, indecent, and profane broadcasts would have been given to faith-based organizations.|$|E

25|$|If a {{constitution}} no longer meets {{the exigencies of}} a society's evolving standard <b>of</b> <b>decency,</b> and the people wish to amend or replace the document, there is nothing stopping them from doing so in the manner which was envisioned by the drafters: through the amendment process.

25|$|He {{took up the}} new {{position}} on September 25, 1584. He now held {{the three most important}} positions in the colony. With this concentration of power, he was able to remedy many of the prevalent abuses, with immediate punishment for those found to be transgressors of the law or <b>of</b> <b>decency.</b> This resulted in much enmity among the governing class, but the lower classes proclaimed him as their defender. He was able to increase rents and payments to Spain considerably.|$|E

Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trusty system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed Frederick had a {{same-sex}} {{relationship with his}} friend, Carl Berling (18121871), publisher {{and owner of the}} newspaper Berlingske Tidende. The bisexual Berling had an illegitimate child with Louise Rasmussen, Carl Christian (18411908) who was much liked by the King, {{to the extent that he}} insisted on signing the new constitution on Carl Christian's 8th birthday on 5 June 1849. To retain a tinge <b>of</b> <b>decency,</b> the King married Louise Rasmussen and the trio then moved into the royal castle where Berling was appointed Chamberlain and remained until 1861. The public indignation within higher circles over Frederick's morganatic marriage is well-known, but reasons have rarely been explained in detail.|$|E

A different director was brought in to reshoot it. Cukor himself said of Bloom: [...] "Claire is not a nice Nellie. She has no inhibitions, and she is not as cold as some people say".|$|R
25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what the law says, not what it should say, and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard <b>of</b> <b>decency,</b> not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E
25|$|In Baby Doll (1956), {{he played}} a man {{frustrated}} by a teenaged wife. The film was condemned by the Legion <b>of</b> <b>Decency</b> and did not air long. He starred in dozens of films from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, such as Fear Strikes Out (1957), Pollyanna (1960), Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), Gypsy (1962), How the West Was Won (1962), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), and Patton (1970), playing General Omar Bradley. At the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony, Malden accepted the best actor Oscar on behalf of George C. Scott, who won {{for his role as}} Patton. After Summertime Killer (1972), he appeared in the made-for-television film The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro (1989) (as Leon Klinghoffer). He directed one complete film Time Limit (1957), and when Delmer Daves took ill during the shooting of The Hanging Tree, Malden took over direction of the film for two weeks.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to be honoured by, among others, the Gaelic Athletic Association and various other organisations. In 1999 the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the river Lee was named by Cork Corporation in his honour. A plaque was also erected at his birthplace in Shandon. Lynch died in the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, Dublin on 20 October 1999 {{at the age of}} 82. He was honoured with a state funeral which was attended by the President of Ireland Mary McAleese, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, former Taoisigh John Bruton, Albert Reynolds and Charles Haughey, and various political persons from all parties. The coffin was then flown from Dublin to Cork where a procession through the streets of the city drew some of the biggest crowds in the city's history. Lynch's friend and political ally, Desmond O'Malley, delivered the graveside oration, paying tribute to Lynch's sense <b>of</b> <b>decency.</b> He is buried in St Finbarr's Cemetery in Cork city.|$|E

25|$|It {{was enacted}} at the {{parliament}} assembled in Forfar in 1057 by King Malcolm Canmore that every baron should erect a gibbet for {{the execution of}} male criminals, and sink a well or pit, for the drowning of females. The term pit and gallows described the jurisdiction of a Baron in criminal cases; in full 'pit and gallows, sake and soke, toll, team, and infangthief'. A pit, according to Mackenzie {{was a form of}} dungeon or prison cell, not a pit for drowning the condemned. Others take the view that the pit was the drowning pool for women and the gallows for the men. It is not clear why men {{were more likely to be}} hanged and women drowned in a fen, river, pit or 'murder hole', however it may relate to ideas <b>of</b> <b>decency.</b> The place name 'Muttonhole' is not infrequently found and one suggestion is that it is derived from 'Mort-toun-hole', another of the names for a hollow where women were drowned.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} on {{the film}} began on July 25. The football sequences appearing in the film were shot at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. After filming had begun, Billy Gilbert and Dick Elliot were also added to the cast. In mid-August, George Offerman, Jr. and Arthur Loft were added to fill minor roles in the production. On September 1, {{it was announced that}} The Big Game {{would be one of the}} first films released on the new 2,000 foot reel, which became the industry standard. During production, Devine and one of the football extras were injured during filming the football sequences, necessitating several days delay in the filming of their scenes. The film opened on October 9, with premieres in San Francisco, California, and Columbus, Ohio, after which it was in heavy demand by theater booking agents. The film was given a Class A-1 rating by the National Legion <b>of</b> <b>Decency,</b> making it appropriate for all audiences.|$|E
25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards <b>of</b> <b>decency</b> that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E
