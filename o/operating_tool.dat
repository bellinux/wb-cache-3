The main topic of the study lies in the existence, necessity and usage of ethical codices in the educational system and in the primary education in particular. In the research part the author puts forward several assumptions about the ethical codex of teachers and by critical observation tests its verity.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the study and {{implementation}} of a path planning system for a multi-rotor {{within the framework of}} autonomous navigation. The theoretical study begins with a brief introduction to the key concepts to understand the planning algorithms, then is presented a brief state of the art about some of the most relevant algorithms and its features. Then is chosen RRT* as the most suitable for our purpose, so we proceed to the analysis of different variants exist to address the next step, creating our own version in Matlab. This finally was not suitable for our purpose due to some shortcomings and inefficiencies. In order to implement an <b>operating</b> <b>tool</b> was decided to use ROS framework and more specifically the MoveIt! software. This makes necessary an introduction to key concepts and operation of the software used. MoveIt! needs some changes to adapt it, since it was conceived as software manipulation in robotic arms not for UAV navigation. All decisions during this period has been strongly influenced by the expectation of a future real implementation. So given some of requirements previously presented, the changes made and the overall performance of the tool are explained. Finally are presented operation advices and a brief benchmarking of different algorithms available in MoveIt! after some tests. Thus we have obtained a fully operative tool for multi-rotor autonomous navigation within a simulated environment in ROS. Note its great adaptability, because it can operate at different simulated environments and with different types of multi-rotors, after just minor modifications...|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of rock desintegration a boring tool is {{subjected}} to the wear. From a viewpoint of the bit wear, changes on the contact of <b>operating</b> <b>tool</b> with rock at its one-shot and rerun load or overload by external forces are technically significant. Theis change results in the degradation of bit working properties and the output of desintegration also decreases. In the major part of cases, together with the bit wear, the contact area of a tool with a rock massifs enhanced and this fact causes an increase of fines (dust) creation during the desintegration. The wear is always connected with a friction, forces action, deformation, damage, and the increased mechanical work consumption. As to energetic aspects of bit wear, the wear was observed {{as a function of}} bore length and in the most of cases as a dependence of the operating time. A linear dependence between the wear intensity (bit wear per unit of bore length) and the specific energy of desintegration (energy consumed per volume unit of desintegrated rock) was experimentally verified. Thus, the changes of bit wear can be implicitly observed by monitoring the specific energy. At the same time, the specific energy is a function of input parameters of the desintegration process and in the field of applicable external forces it shows an extreme (minimum). Therefore, the specific energy is useful for the extreme optimisation of the rock desintegration process from the viewpoint of the bit wear. It was mathematically proven that the tool output at the desintegration exponentially decreases with the amount of work consumed in the rock desintegration. The derivation of this knowledge comes out from the Krendelev equation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{for using the}} GIS Arc/Info system as an <b>operating</b> <b>tool</b> to study excavation finds and structures on an archaeological site. The choice of the archaeological sample site (Villa Rufolo, Ravello - Italy) and the definition of information and methodologies useful to its study and management {{were the result of}} collaboration between a photogrammetry partnership (S. F. M.) and the “N. Cilento” archaeological laboratory of the University of Salerno. The GIS architecture was developed starting from the analysis of methods common to both the research methodologies (landscape recognition and stratigraphic excavations), which define the phases of archaeological data manipulation. The main aim was to create a tool which, starting from the planimetric documentation of each excavation, could link the various environments to their related stratigraphic units through data derived both from the individual structures and from artefacts. Following Arc/Info data models, all information was arranged into a relational database. The Stratigraphic Unit (US) attribute forms the link which connects the graphical elements, geographical and spatial database, and the descriptive database. Data stored can be analysed using many criteria, and the GIS always makes it possible to display the graphic results of the analysis. Besides the management, integration and manipulation of the archaeological data assigned to the territory under investigation, with Arch/Info various data levels can be combined for the purpose of producing new types of information; this information is usually acquired by employing techniques of data overlapping and through statistic and classification processing of all the stratigraphic units related to the site. The next stage of our project will consist of a careful check {{of the results of the}} statistical and classification processes and the use of this model at other archaeological sites so as to exploit the GIS potential for comparing excavation data as well as the geomorphologic and geographic features of the various sites...|$|E
