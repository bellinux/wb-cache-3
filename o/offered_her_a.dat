She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States.

In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E

She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only supposed to have a three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous.|$|E
5|$|She {{began writing}} songs and {{recording}} demos, {{but after a}} few months, all the demos she had sent to record companies around the UK were returned with negative replies. She began thinking about moving to another country, and initially considered moving to the Netherlands, but later decided on France. In 1996, her international career began to advance; she was introduced to producer Erick Benzi, who previously had worked with Celine Dion, Jean-Jacques Goldman and Johnny Hallyday. Impressed by Anggun's talent, Benzi immediately <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> recording deal. Later that year, Anggun was signed to Columbia France and Sony Music Entertainment.

5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode {{introduced}} {{three additional}} primary cast members. Montag, who was previously featured on Laguna Beach {{in a limited}} capacity, became Conrad's housemate by the time production had begun on the first season of The Hills. On the series, it was depicted as if Montag had befriended Patridge by her own doing, though Patridge claimed that a producer <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> position on the series to become friends with Conrad and Montag. Port {{was introduced to the}} series as Conrad's co-intern at Teen Vogue.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Glynne {{graduated}} she {{was offered}} a post in the University College of North Wales department of agriculture, but {{within a few months}} she was volunteering at Rothamsted Experimental Station where E. John Russell was director. Winifred Brenchley, the first woman to work in agricultural sciences, soon <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> permanent assistant botanist position at Rothamsted, where she remained for 43 years. Glynne was one of the original members of the Mycology Department in 1918 and later founded the Plant Pathology Department. Glynne's first major work was studying Synchytrium endobioticum, the cause of potato wart disease. A modified version of her method for identifying varieties resistant to the disease, the Glynne-Lemmerzahl method, is still in use today. The work was sufficiently notable that the University of Wales awarded Glynne an MSc in 1922 for her achievements.|$|E

5|$|Corzine, who {{was running}} for the United State Senate {{in the spring of}} 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married {{president}} of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} marked the {{introduction}} of Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing {{at the opening of}} the third season. Ramirez was cast after ABC executives <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> role in the network show of her choice, Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode. Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) also joined the show in season two, after making a guest appearance in season one. In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of the third season. Washington also made a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of the third season, Walsh also departed the show to pursue the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice, but continues to make guest appearances.|$|E

5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later <b>offered</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Sigurd Munn's {{daughter}} Cecilia acknowledged Sverre {{as the son}} of Sigurd is inconclusive.
