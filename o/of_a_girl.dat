5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E

5|$|Eric Church {{wrote the}} song with Jeff Hyde and Ryan Tyndell. The {{basis for the}} song came from a memory <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> and {{involved}} another artist's song. Church chose to base the song around an idol of his, Bruce Springsteen, whose career he admires. During {{the course of the}} song, Church makes several allusions to Springsteen; he mentions the Springsteen songs Born to Run, Born in the USA, Glory Days, and I'm on Fire. While being named after Springsteen and making several references to him, the song however {{tells the story of a}} teenage romance.|$|E

The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E

She discovers that he also has memories of Pompeii and brings them to Shuna hoping it would bring back her memories. She {{is in the same}} class as Yuuma where their similarities make them seem like twins. Reina and Yuuma grow close as friends and begin to speak to each other about their problems. They connect over their predicament of having romantic feelings for those who only see them as a younger sibling. Reina is later revealed to be the reincarnation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> named , a friend of Serena.

5|$|Scarygirl {{places the}} player in control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> who is sent {{from her home}} to a far-away city on a rescue mission. The girl is able to jump, grapple, and hover her way though seven game worlds, either alone or with another player in a {{cooperative}} multiplayer mode. Combat is handled through combining strings of light and heavy attacks, with grapple-based attacks becoming available once enemies take enough damage. Roundly praised for Jurevicius' art, ScaryGirl received otherwise mixed reviews upon its release. Critics found fault with both the control scheme and its combat system, although boss battles did receive some praise.|$|E
5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.|$|E

While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E
5|$|The title {{refers to}} the ancient Indian {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors. It was also an affirmation to one of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's beliefs about an individual's right to make own choices. The film's English title for international release was mainly One's Own Choice, however it was shown at the Moscow International Film Festival under the title, On Own Will. Other translations of the Malayalam title have also been used, such as By Choice, Her Own Choice, Marriage by Choice, Betrothal by Choice, The Betrothal, and The Selection.|$|E

She also lauded {{the director of the}} video, Dave Meyers, for his ability to use Clarkson's evolution as an element to overshadow the distracting clips from The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement despite noticing that the use of visual metaphors in the music video was overwrought.|$|E

The Für Das Kind Kindertransport Memorial sculpture by artist Flor Kent was installed at the station in September 2003 commemorating this event.

The objects included in the sculpture began to deteriorate in bad weather, and a replacement bronze memorial, Kindertransport – The Arrival by Frank Meisler was installed as a replacement at the main entrance in November 2006. The child statue from the Kent memorial was re-erected separately in 2011.|$|E
