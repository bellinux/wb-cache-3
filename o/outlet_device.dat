40|$|Erosion, transportation, and {{deposition}} of sediment into receiving waters can have substantial environmental and economic impacts. Sedimentation basins are a remediation technique used to limit sediment transport from earth disturbance activities. Retention efficiency {{is used as a}} measure of a sedimentation basin’s effectiveness. Several factors influence retention efficiency including the type of principal spillway used. The most common spillway is the perforated riser which dewaters the basin throughout its entire vertical profile. However, a relatively new <b>outlet</b> <b>device,</b> the skimmer, has been developed, which dewaters the basin from the water surface. A laboratory study was conducted to compare the skimmer with the perforated riser for three different soil types and determine if there were any significant differences in the trapping efficiencies of the two outlets. The test basin dewatered over a three hour period. The parameters observed were dewatering rate, effluent sediment concentration, sediment loss rate, and retention efficiency. The skimmer treatments consistently had higher values of sediment retention efficiencies. A statistical analysis performed on the retention efficiency data showed tha...|$|E

On <b>outlet</b> <b>device,</b> the PL C can precisely open highspeed electro-magnetic valves to blow high speed air to associate kernel in themoving belt into proper containers. The system utilizes machine vision to grab "Tainung 67 " brown rice. From animage of maximum 24 isolated brown rice kernels, 14 quality related parametersare calculated from each kernel. The parameters include projection area, ratioof area to perimeter, compactness, ratio of {{long and short}} axles from Hotellingtransformation, sum of length differences of short axles to their mean, sum ofabsolute value of length difference of short axles to their mean, average graylevels of red, green and blue component, standard deviations of gray leveldistribution of red, green and blue, and chalky area ratio. From theseparameters, brown rice kernel can be classified into sound kernel, discoloredkernel, chalky kernel, off-type kernel, rusty kernel, green immature kernel, abnormal kernel and rice screening eight categories. From the procedures of system performance adjusting and evaluation, it isobserved that the spread device can have higher efficiency when there is morekernels, over 2000 kernels, put into the intake device. The average rate ofkernels properly spread into belt holes is 81 %.

40|$|In {{particular}} the thermal comfort of passengers {{is the essential}} design objective in the cabin air ventilation layout for modern civil passenger aircraft. Solar radiation, electrical equipment, on-board electronics, high power converters, in-flight entertainment and communication devices and most important the heat release of the passengers are representing thermal loads. This heat loads have to be balanced by cold air coming from the air vents of cabin air outlets of the air ventilation system. In fact, the temperature distribution inside the passenger cabin can only be controlled by the air conditioning system. Besides providing the passengers with the fresh, an essential task is to avoid discomfort for the passengers by ensuring a good mixing of fresh with aged air and by guaranteeing a high air flow exchange rate for each individual passenger {{according to the requirements}} defined in. Cabin air outlets are a crucial device for the air flow distribution within the cabin. Although a high air exchange rate is necessary for thermal comfort the incoming fresh air must not exceed a certain flow velocity in order to avoid gust. Therefore, the air should be evenly distributed by an <b>outlet</b> <b>device,</b> i. e. a plenum, an orifice plate or flow straighteners, before it can leave the outlets through the vents forming a homogeneous planar air jet. This optimal precondition facilitates a successive control of the air distribution within the aircraft cabin. In particular, in the early design phase of aircraft cabin layouts numerical flow simulations are undertaken presuming that this precondition is fulfilled. In fact this is not always the case; hence, design work has to be done to improve cabin air outlets. Unfortunately, the space envelope for cabin air outlets is quite limited by stringers, insulation, ducting, wires, cables or lining elements. Not only the outer space envelope is a major constraint when designing air outlets, moreover, internal drag and weight {{have a negative impact on}} the power consumption of the Environmental Control System (ECS) and, therefore, on the fuel consumption of the aircraft. Both have to be minimized in order to save power and costs. Not at all, the optimization of cabin air outlets is a major task in the design process of the air ventilation system, in particular when bearing in mind that future cabin interior will be modularly designed and especially customized in order to meet corporate design constraints of the airliners...|$|E
40|$|Structural best {{management}} practices (BMPs) are used to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Most structural BMPs provide treatment by filtering runoff through a filter media or collecting it in a detention basin and slowly discharging it {{over an extended period}} of time to allow suspended solids and associated contaminants to settle out. The purpose of this study is to design an effective outlet structure that provides adequate filtration or slows discharge to 40 hours. A model detention basin was constructed in the Civil Engineering Hydraulics Laboratory at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and two full scale outlet structures were tested in it. The first <b>outlet</b> <b>device</b> was an orifice controlled perforated riser. Discharge from the device was measured at many head levels and the results correlated well with discharge given by the orifice equation. The orifice controlled perforated riser adequately provided a 40 hour drain time and can be sized for various detention basin sizes using the orifice equation. At low heads, however, it was observed that perforations in the riser pipe could also control flow rates, depending on the size, elevation, and number of the lowest perforations. The second outlet structure tested was a filtered perforated riser. An 18 ” diameter barrel was placed around the perforated riser and filled with coarse (D 50 = 0. 11 in) sand. Fifteen tests were run where sediment laden water was cycled through the filtered riser. The device provided good filtration but showed significant clogging. The filter media, in series with the orifice, impacted flow rates and was modeled using an unconfined aquifer equation. The unconfined aquifer equation was used to estimate changes in hydraulic conductivity as the filter began to clog with sediment. However, clogging of the filter screen was also observed and was modeled as a minor loss. Estimation of the minor loss coefficient provided a better fit to the data than the hydraulic conductivity. Therefore, it was concluded that the clogging of the filter screen was the significant driver of the head loss. Both methods of estimating clogging showed a dramatic initial increase in head loss, followed by much smaller increases. When designing the filtered riser these changes in head loss should be considered and the filtered riser should be sized based on flow rates after initial clogging. Advisor: David M. Admiraa...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 The {{financial}} and process benefits {{of improving the}} mill fiber line are widely acknowledged. However, process optimization of the fiber line is difficult due to the complex behavior of pulp and paper systems. The dissertation project focused on application of multivariate analysis techniques for understanding and improving fiber line performance. Models for prediction and variability analysis of kappa number and total bleaching cost were developed using data generated by pulping and bleaching operations. The research project led to refinement of earlier methods of data preprocessing and development of algorithmic solution for the data time shifting problem. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze sources of kappa and bleaching cost variability for Weyerhaeuser Longview mill and Georgia Pacific Ashdown mill. For the Weyerhaeuser Longview mill, factor analysis allowed development of models that successfully predict kappa number out of a continuous digester and O 2 delignification stage. The most important cause of kappa variability in the continuous digester {{was found to be}} mischarges in alkali. Variations in kappa number can be reduced by 45 % in the digester and 40 % in the O 2 delignification reactor if variables correlating with the important factors are brought under control. None of the multivariate techniques were successful in predicting K-number for the Georgia Pacific Ashdown mill. The main reason for poor prediction was that the digester was already under tight control as evident from low (6. 12 %) coefficient of variation of K-number. Processes under tight control appear to generate datasets with minimal correlation structures. Such datasets are not suitable candidates for the purposes of predicting output variables such as K-number. In the bleaching study, principal component analysis as well as factor analysis models with fourteen upstream variables successfully predicted bleaching cost trend. However, neural networks bleaching cost predictions were poor. Factor analysis and PCA models of the bleaching cost indicated that most of the bleaching cost variability was either due to lignin factor (which represents pulping and washing variables) or due to digester column stability represented by <b>outlet</b> <b>device</b> amperage. A method to compare results from various multivariate methodologies was also developed. The factor model with fourteen variables achieved the highest score on comparison scale for bleaching cost study. Both the lignin and digester stability factor point at the digester being the major source of bleaching cost variability. It appears that there are variations in pulp lignin content (or some latent variable) that are not measured by the K number test at the Decker, but results in changes in the chlorine requirements at the D/C stage. In this situation, bleaching cost predicted by the model may be used as a soft sensor to manipulate temperature, steam flow in digester to produce pulp with uniform bleach chemical requirements (i. e., consistent latent variable variation). This way cost variability will be reduced, as presumably the variation in lignin content will be minimized...|$|E

Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: Older existing cartridge collector types have a range of actual operating efficiencies of 99 to 99. 9 % for PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Typical new equipment design efficiencies are between 99. 99 and 99. 999 + % (EPA, 1998 b). In addition, commercially available designs are able to control submicron PM (0. 8 µm in diameter or greater) with a removal efficiency of 99. 999 + % (AAF, 1999; Torit, 1999). Several factors determine cartridge filter collection efficiency including gas filtration velocity, particle characteristics, filter media characteristics, and cleaning mechanism. In general, collection efficiency increases with increasing filtration velocity and particle size. For a given combination of filter design and dust, the effluent particle concentration from a cartridge collector is nearly constant, whereas the overall efficiency is more likely to vary with particulate loading.

40|$|This {{technical}} note describes a spreadsheet calculatioml procedure (DILUTE) for estimating alternate releases from different <b>outlet</b> <b>devices</b> {{to meet a}} specific release dissolved oxygen target. Background When low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations occur in release from a Corps of Engineers reservoir, an option for increasing the level of DO leaving the tailrace is a supplemental release through an aerating outlet. For example, during nongeneration periods, a small discharge of poorquality water can pass through the hydroturbines because of wicket gate leakage. Without some improvement technique, the water leaving the tailrace area would be very low in DO. The DC) concentration of the water leaving the tailrace area can be improved by diluting this poorquality water with highly aerated water from another outlet at the project. Sluiceway, spillway, or overflow weir releases are most often used in this enhancement technique. Generally, the flow from a spillway, sluiceway, or an overflow weir will have a much higher DO concentration than the poorquality discharge. A flow-weighted average {{can be used to}} estimate the required release from the aerating outlet to provide a desired average DO level exiting the tailrace area. To estimate the required release from the alternate source, the DO of the alternate release must be calculated. The spreadsheet DILUTE calculates the oxygen concentration in the releases through the aerating outlet and uses this concentration in the flow-weighted averaging process to estimate the required release discharge.

Also majority were male (83. 2 %), had tertiary education (84. 0 %) and kept Catfish (90. 4 %). The mean income earned was N 1, 012, 320. 00. Commonly used/ adopted improved fish technologies were floating feeds (84. 8 %), standard feeding regimes (84. 0 %), improved breeds of fingerlings (80. 0 %) and provision of inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>devices</b> in pond (78. 4). Farmers’ perceptions were that the use of improved fish production technology saves time (mean= 1. 34), increases profit/improved income (mean= 1. 12) and conserves fish farmers’ energy (mean= 1. 08). This study found average increase in output: input ratio as 0. 77 kg of harvest per fish fingerlings stocked due to improved fish technology when compared to that before adoption of improved technology.

Demand peak shifting, motivated by time-of-use pricing, {{is a way}} to reduce electric capacity requirements, as well as align loads with variable alternate sources such as wind or solar. These methods require feedback from the customers via a smart meter to see real time power usage and other data such as individual load usage. Smart meters allow the end-user {{to take advantage of the}} time-of-use pricing schemes to intelligently use their highest power loads during the low point of pricing, as well as gaining a better understanding of how the loads in their household use electricity. Individual appliance monitoring can be by a distributed sensing network, where each appliance or device has its own direct communication line with the smart meter. A much less costly alternative is non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), which uses information seen in the power consumption profiles or actual current and voltage signals, to determine appliance usage. NILM does not require professional installation and voltage signal acquisition and can be measured right at a typical household <b>outlet.</b> <b>Devices</b> impart voltage transients or noise on the power line of the house when they are switched that can be used for NILM. The transients of particular loads can provide signatures specific to them. However, the load itself can introduce transients independent of switching, and these need to be distinguished. Particularly, we show here that motors having commutating switches introduce repetitive transients that resemble load switching. Time-frequency analysis provides insight into these short-time non-stationary signals. An experimental setup was implemented in order to record voltage transients of a few different common household loads. It is shown that universal motor loads with a commutating switch can be detected separately than transients created by a single switching action typical of most devices.
