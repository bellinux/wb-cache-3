500|$|The {{progress}} of Fusōs construction, while the IJN {{waited for the}} funding to be released and foreign developments, caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō-class design. The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> as they complicated {{the protection of the}} midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired. Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the [...] shells used in the manually loaded [...] secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs. To resolve this issue, the IJN designed a smaller [...] gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire. It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British s and Russian s. For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by [...] to [...] To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class. This reduced the crew's accommodations despite {{a significant increase in the}} crew's numbers and naval historian Fukui Shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any Japanese capital ship. The final design was designated A-92 by the IJN and differed enough from the A-64 design of the Fusō class that it was considered a separate class.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you think}} you are right to send Macaire and the Admiral about? Not a copy have I sent, nor (speaking for myself personally) do I want sent. The reperusal of the Admiral, by the way, was a sore blow; eh, God, man, it is a low, black, dirty, blackguard, ragged piece: vomitable in many parts--simply vomitable. Pew is in places a reproach to both art and man. But of all that afterwards. What I mean is that I believe in playing dark with second and third-rate work. Macaire is a piece of job-work, hurriedly bockled; might have been worse, might have been better; happy-go-lucky; act it or-let-it-rot piece of business. Not a thing, I think, to send in presentations. Do not let us gober ourselves--and, above all, not gober dam pot-boilers--and p.b.'s with an <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> and hole in them, such as is our unrealised Bertrand in this one. But of this also, on a meeting.|$|E

It has been suggested that he may have inadvertently achieved the exact opposite of constructing in cosmic harmony with the power of ley lines.|$|E
5000|$|Many saw the {{argument}} as a weak justification for exploitation, and a flimsy example of creating your own science to reference as proof. An <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> lies {{in that there}} are no indications as to which class or race rightfully belongs to the mudsill other than the pre-supposed regional groups that were already in place at the [...] "bottom", or the class or race that was the least technologically and culturally advanced, thus causing a circular argument.|$|E
5000|$|As Reed says, {{we should}} not see this matriarchy as a [...] "lost paradise" [...] (page xviii). One <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> with the early social {{structure}} based on totem and taboo was that it always required some people to be outside the favoured kin groups {{in order to provide}} sexual partners (pp319,355,381). When men started to cohabit with women as husbands they were divided between their responsibility in their own lineage for their sisters' sons and their responsibility for their wives' children. Reed speculates that this may have been the cause of widespread child sacrifices in many communities at the dawn of 'civilization' (pp403-4).|$|E

[...] Even among those organizations that considered using the FirstClass system, the lack of a robust calendaring component during this time (until FirstClass version 6 in 2001) was an <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw.</b> Nevertheless, FirstClass was recognized as a notable (though not top) vendor of worldwide integrated collaborative environments by International Data Corporation in 2004.|$|E
50|$|An <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> {{exhibited}} by pie charts {{is that they}} cannot show {{more than a few}} values without separating the visual encoding (the “slices”) from the data they represent (typically percentages). When slices become too small, pie charts have to rely on colors, textures or arrows so the reader can understand them. This makes them unsuitable for use with larger amounts of data. Pie charts also take up a larger amount of space on the page compared to the more flexible bar charts, which do not need to have separate legends, and can display other values such as averages or targets at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Valentinian himself {{seems to}} have {{exercised}} no real authority, and was a figurehead for various powerful interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the empire had been ruled by powerful generals, a situation formalised by Diocletian and his collegiate system. While Constantine I and his sons had been strong military figures, they had also re-established the practice of hereditary succession, adopted by Valentinian I. The <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> in these two competing requirements came in the reign of Valentinian II, a child. His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when children or nonentities, reigning as emperors, were controlled by powerful generals and officials.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} the agents to not be {{affected}} by the flash, they wear Ray-Ban super dark sunglasses that reflect the rays. After being neuralyzed, the agents have about 30 seconds to supply new memories to replace the ones they've just erased. If there are more witnesses to neuralyze, or if they are pressed for time, a special team is sent in to supply memories. The <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> of the neuralyzer is that it can't delete a specific desired memory but only can erase all memories of a certain time period starting from the point when it's used, so, if a memory from an earlier time period has to be erased, so do all memories following that specific memory right to the point of the usage.|$|E
50|$|This {{lawsuit was}} in {{litigation}} {{for four years}} (1948-1951) and, finally, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, not because it was unmerited, but, relying on the precedent set by the Cook vs Davis Supreme Court case, it had ruled that all administrative remedies had to be exhausted before the case could be heard by the Court. The plaintiff must first seek relief from the local school board; if not given, then relief should be sought from the county board of education. If no relief is given there, then redress should be sought from the State. The <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> and futility of this gesture is that a plaintiff would never survive the first step before employment would be terminated, {{as was the case}} with Mrs. Bates and her husband.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "hot set" [...] is used amongst {{animator}}s during production. It {{refers to}} a set where an animator is filming. The clay characters are set in a perfect position where they can continue shooting where they left off. If an animator calls his set a [...] "hot set," [...] then no one is allowed to touch the set or else the shoot would be ruined. Certain scenes must be shot rather quickly. If a scene is left unfinished and the weather is perhaps humid, then the set and characters have an obvious difference. The clay puppets may be deformed from the humidity or the air pressure could have caused the set to shift slightly. These small differences can create an <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> to the scene. To avoid these disasters, scenes normally have to be shot in one day or less.|$|E

5000|$|Henry Birtles' [...] "Advantage" [...] {{proposal}} {{is for the}} shoot-out to be held before extra-time, and only acting as a tiebreak if the game remains a draw after the full 120 minutes. Proponents of this idea state that {{it would lead to}} a more offensive extra-time as one of the teams would know they have to score and there would never be a match in which both teams are simply waiting for penalties. Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra-time. The <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> is that the team that wins the penalty shoot-out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through. However, this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing, as opposed to a team which defends a single goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} stop continual system crashes caused by this issue, System 6 and earlier running on a 68020 or a 68030 would force the machine into 24-bit mode, and would only {{recognize}} and address the first 8 megabytes of RAM, an <b>obvious</b> <b>flaw</b> in machines whose hardware was wired to accept up to 128 MB RAM - and whose product literature advertised this capability. With System 7, the Mac system software was finally made 32-bit clean, but there were still the problem of dirty ROMs. The {{problem was that the}} decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made very early in the boot process, when the ROM routines initialized the Memory Manager to set up a basic Mac environment where NuBus ROMs and disk drivers are loaded and executed. Older ROMs did not have any 32-bit Memory Manager support and so was not possible to boot into 32-bit mode. Surprisingly, the first solution to this flaw was published by software utility company Connectix, whose 1991 product MODE32 reinitialized the Memory Manager and repeated early parts of the Mac boot process, allowing the system to boot into 32-bit mode and enabling the use of all the RAM in the machine. Apple licensed the software from Connectix later in 1991 and distributed it for free. The Macintosh IIci and later Motorola based Macintosh computers had 32-bit clean ROMs.|$|E
