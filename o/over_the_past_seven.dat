This issue is also an area of concern for Monsanto. The hybrid corn pricing team at Monsanto is concerned that they price current products at a point to maximize profits while continuing to grow market share. The key is to price at a point that captures all the value of the differentiated products Monsanto offers. The objective for this study is to estimate a demand model for the hybrid seed corn industry. The demand model will allow us to look at many different aspects of the hybrid seed corn industry and also evaluate the own-price and cross-price elasticities. The own-price elasticity is especially important because it will be used to determine if current pricing is revenue or profit-maximizing. A hedonic pricing model was also estimated in this study to complement the demand model. It is important for Monsanto to understand what attributes or traits are significant in pricing and demand...|$|R

The maps were based on different conceptual models which reflected advances in soil science as well as societal demands. There are four phases in the development of soil mapping in The Netherlands. The first three are: (i) the geological phase (1837 – 1937), (ii) the physiographic phase (1937 – 1962) and (iii) the morphometric phase (1962 – 1995). The earliest soil maps, made in the mid- 1800 s, were largely based on surface geology. In 1950 the first national soil map was published based on physiographic soil mapping. From the 1960 s onwards, mapping followed a pedogenetic–morphometric approach and these maps have been widely used in land use planning, hydrologic studies, re-allotments, and agricultural land evaluations. An increase in environmental awareness with the need to assess environmental impacts and developments in information technology induced the digital soil information phase (1995 –present). New technologies have improved the collection, storage, analysis and presentation of soil geographic information. It is concluded that initial soil mapping in The Netherlands had a strong agricultural focus but that the current maps are used in a wide range of applications...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the {{historical}} records of Etnas eruptive activity for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three centuries shows that, after the large 1669 eruption, {{a period of about}} 60 years of low-level activity followed. Starting from 1727, explosive activity (strombolian, lava fountaining and subplinian) at the summit crater increased exponentially to the present day. Since 1763, the frequency of flank eruptions also increased and this value remained high until 1960; afterward it further increased sharply. In fact, the number of summit and flank eruptions between 1961 and 2003 was four times greater than that of the pre- 1960 period. This long-term trend of escalating activity rules out a pattern of cyclic behaviour of the volcano. We propose instead that the 16702003 period most likely characterises a single eruptive cycle which began after the large 1669 eruption and which is still continuing. On the basis of the eruptive style, two distinct types of flank eruptions are recognised: Class A and Class B. Class A eruptions are mostly effusive with associated weak strombolian activity; Class B eruptions are characterised by effusive activity accompanied by intense, long-lasting, strombolian and lava fountaining activity that produces copious tephra fallouts, as during the 2001 and 20022003 eruptions. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three centuries, <b>seven</b> Class B eruptions have taken place with vents located mainly on the south-eastern flank, indicating that this sector of the volcano is a preferential zone for the intrusion of volatile-rich magma rising from the deeper region of the Etna plumbing system...|$|R

Here we record the eighth establishment, a braconid wasp Aphidius matricariae Haliday, which uses the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) as its only host on the island. Molecular markers (18 S rDNA and mtCOI) support the conventional taxonomic identification and indicate that all individuals {{are characterized by}} a single haplotype. Surveys around the island show that adult abundance {{and the frequency of}} aphid parasitism are highest at Macaroni Bay on the east coast, and decline away from this region to low or zero values elsewhere on the coast. The South African research and supply vessel, the SA Agulhas, regularly anchors at Macaroni Bay, and Aphidius sp. have been collected from its galley hold. Current abundance structure, low haplotype diversity, and the operating procedures of the SA Agulhas all suggest that the parasitoid was introduced to the island by humans. Regular surveys indicate that this introduction took place between April 2001 and April 2003, the latter being the first month when this species was detected. The wasp's establishment has significantly added to trophic complexity on the island. Low haplotype diversity suggests that propagule pressure is of little consequence for insect introductions. Rather, single or just a few individuals are probably sufficient for successful establishment. © 2007 Springer-Verlag. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Historically the NSLS {{has been}} active in R&D for {{state-of-the-art}} electron beams, photon beams and x-ray optics. One of the available straight sections has therefore been dedicated to insertion device R&D. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> five to <b>seven</b> years a program aimed at exploiting the very small vertical {beta} function in the straight sections has yielded first a prototype small gap undulator (PSGU) and then an in-vacuum undulator (IVUN). The IVUN sources attain a brightness similar to the existing hybrid wigglers in X 21 and X 25. They radiate significantly lower total power than the wigglers but produce higher power densities. They provide undulator rather than wiggler spectra. Because of the small gaps and small periods there is not much tunability in these devices and they will have to be purpose-built for a specific scientific program. The original IVUN parameters were chosen for in-elastic x-ray scattering, similar to the scientific program on X 21. This put the fundamental at 4. 6 keV and the third harmonic at 13. 8 keV. The question that this new possible insertion device poses is what science programs can best take advantage of this new insertion device source? To answer this, a task force was formed by M. Hart, NSLS Department Chair and charged with identifying viable scientific programs that could seek outside funding to construct IVUN beamlines. The task force concentrated on experimental programs that are presently being pursued on new insertion devices worldwide. For example, x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, which takes advantage of the large coherent flux from undulator sources, was considered. However, this program was not considered as the highest priority. The general area of protein crystallography, however, is ideal for the IVUN source. The unique electron beam optics that makes the IVUN possible in the first place also makes the IVUN ideal as a source for microdiffraction...|$|R
