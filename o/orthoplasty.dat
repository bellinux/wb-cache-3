40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO 2 T) with buccal mucosal tube urethroplasty in adult patients with hypospadias. Material and Method: Sixteen adult patients with hypospadias were included in our study. Patients with a short urethra and penile curvature were treated in two stages (<b>orthoplasty</b> buccal mucosal tube urethroplasty). Buccal mucosa was taken and prepared for tube urethroplasty around a 16 French (Fr) nelaton catheter and the urethral tube was introduced between the urethral meatus and glans penis. Beginning the 1 st postoperative day (HBO 2 T) was applied for 10 sessions during weekdays in 13 patients. Results: The mean age was 21 (± 1. 23) years and mean follow-up time was 10. 1 (± 2. 1) months. In the group who received HBO 2 T postoperatively (n= 13), a two-stage (<b>orthoplasty</b> buccal mucosal tube urethroplasty) procedure was performed in 6 (46 %), and the mean length of graft was 5. 4 (± 1. 23) cm. In this group of 13 the success rate without any additional manipulations (urethrotomy intern, fistula repair) was 54 % (7 / 13). After additional manipulations, complete healing was achieved in 11 out of 13 patients (84. 6 %). In the group who did not receive HBO 2 T postoperatively (n= 3), a two-stage procedure was performed in 1 patient (33 %), and the mean length of graft was 8 (± 5) cm. In this group of 3, complete healing was not achieved {{in any of these}} patients {{as a result of the}} hypospadias surgery. However, after the additional manipulations, complete healing was achieved in 1 patient (33 %). Discussion: Given the promising rates of surgical success, postoperative HBO 2 T might be considered as a supportive treatment modality for adult patients with hypospadias who undergo buccal mucosal tube urethroplasty. Randomized controlled studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Brief {{introduction}} of hypospadias surgery The initial evaluation {{of individuals with}} hypospadias involves localizing the meatus, evaluating for chordee, and inspecting the foreskin. The goal of the initial repair {{is to ensure that}} the penis is straight for successful intercourse and that the meatus is as distal as possible {{in order to create a}} forwardly directed urinary stream. There are five tenets that are used to assist with this: <b>orthoplasty,</b> urethroplasty, meatoplasty/glanuloplasty, scrotoplasty, and finally skin coverage. Hypospadias repairs can generally be categorized into four types of repairs: urethral advancement procedures, tubularization of the urethral plate, substitution or supplementation of the urethral plate with local tissue or skin flaps, and substitution or supplementation of the urethral plate with grafts. Hypospadias complications The term ‘hypospadias cripple ’ has been coined for individuals with remaining functional complications after multiple attempts at hypospadias repair. This term, however, is somewhat pejorative and should probably be avoided in contemporary discussion of this problem. Men have a very heavy burden of psychological problems related to the complications of failed hypospadias repair. A recent study (1) shows that individuals who underwent a successful hypospadias repair scored more favorably on a psychosexual questionnaire when compared to individuals who did not have a successful outcome from their repair. Terms like ‘hypospadias cripple ’ can further undermine men’s feelings of being whole and confidence in their sexual self-perception...|$|E
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{follow-up study}} {{was carried out}} {{on the results of}} the van der Meulen one stage (vdMI) and two stage (vdMII) technique as well as the combination of a Byars <b>orthoplasty</b> with a Denis Browne urethroplasty (By/DB) for hypospadias. Special attention was paid to the functional outcome (spraying, dribbling, urinary deviation), findings at physical examination (curvature, skin surplus, stenosis, fistula, torsion, etc) and the correlation between complaints on function and physical abnormalities. An attendance score of 32 % was achieved out of 567 patients. With the primary referred patients, spraying was encountered infrequently (vdMI 8 %, vdMII 12 % and By/DB 12 %). Postmicturitional dribbling was reported by 16 % of patients treated with vdMI repairs, 24 % of the vdMII operations and after 30 % of the By/DB repairs. Deviation of urinary stream was mentioned by 32 % of the vdMI patients, 18 % of the vdMII patients and 21 % of the By/DB patients. There was no correlation between the findings at physical examination and the functional complaints. Mild torsion of the penile body and skin surplus were observed without having clinical consequences. Fistulae were not seen at follow-up and six patients had mild residual curvature of the penile body without clinical significance. Surplus of skin was observed in approximately 20 % of patients, but none of the patients requested correction of this cosmetic problem. (C) 2000 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons...|$|E
40|$|Salvage hypospadias {{surgery is}} {{performed}} after failed primary reconstruction. Several treatment strategies have been suggested, all with pros and cons. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate our treatment algorithm for primary hypospadias repair applied to secondary cases in which a salvage procedure is indicated and, most importantly, local tissue is present. The algorithm was applied to 36 consecutive patients who had undergone a total of 109 surgical procedures before referral. In accordance with the algorithm, 12 patients without ventral curvature achieved a satisfactory result with one procedure by the use of local skin flaps. Six patients with moderate ventral curvature underwent <b>orthoplasty,</b> fistula closure, and/or urethral reconstruction using local skin flaps in one session. Eighteen patients with a severe ventral curvature or a proximal meatus were reconstructed in two stages using Byars' technique. After a median of two salvage procedures (range: 1 - 4), all patients but one, who awaits splitting of a skin bridge in the meatus, were successfully reconstructed. Two patients in active follow-up have potential problems requiring further surgery. Our findings indicate that failed hypospadias repairs are often due to an underestimation of the ventral curvature at the initial repair. Therefore, reevaluation of the degree of curvature is important. One-stage salvage repairs can be used, provided that none or minimal curvature remains. In cases of marked curvature, however, a meticulous resection of the chordee and ventral scarring is crucial. The subsequent repair of the large ventral defect and the long urethral reconstruction can, in most cases, be safely managed in a two-stage procedure...|$|E
40|$|Hypospadias cripples can {{be defined}} as {{patients}} with remaining functional complications after previous hypospadias repair. A retrospective followup study was per formed on the long-term results of a group of 94 patients disabled by hypospadias. The records of 94 patients showed that they presented with the following problems: 82 had a major meatal dystopia (87 percent), 43 (46 percent) had residual curvature of the penile body, 19 (20 percent) showed meatal stenosis, and only 5 (5 percent) had one or more fistulas. The techniques used to solve these problems were circumferential advancement of penile skin, dorsal transposition flap of preputial skin, distally based transposition flap of penile skin, and full-thickness skin graft. Between one and nine operations were needed to achieve the desired result (mean and median of two operations). The complications after these procedures were 11 fistulas in nine patients, meatal stenosis caused by tight scarring in six patients, and a residual curvature after an <b>orthoplasty</b> that had to be released once before a urethroplasty could be performed. Forty-three men were seen at long-term follow-up (range, 2 to 25 years; mean, 12 years). Functional complaints that were seen included spraying at micturition (5 patients, 12 percent), dribbling (6 patients, 14 percent), and deviation of urinary stream (7 patients, 16 percent). No patients complained of painful miction, hesitation, or straining. At physical examination, 4 patients had a residual curvature (three of which were mild without functional problems), 5 had a skin surplus, 1 presented with a fistula after an operation in another hospital, and 13 had a penile torsion. Only 6 patients had a penile torsion greater than 10 degrees, which was evenly distributed to the left and right. There was no correlation between any functional complaint and the presence of a physical abnormality...|$|E
40|$|To simplify and {{standardize}} surgical {{management of}} hypospadias, a modified tubularised incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty (Snodgrass) technique {{has been described}} and a revised hypospadias management algorithm has been formulated. The study aims to evaluate {{the viability of the}} described procedure in different types of hypospadias and tests the validity of the algorithm. The modification described is recruitment of penile and glandular skin lateral to the urethral plate to facilitate tubularisation. The algorithm starts with penile degloving with preservation of urethral plate. Snodgrass repair was done in cases with no chordee and where skin chordee resolved by skin take down. Modified Snodgrass repair was done in cases where urethral plate was narrow. Another modification proposed by us is single layer penile skin closure instead of an added dartos flap, which was done in both classical and modified Snodgrass repair. Cases of severe chordee not resolved by skin take down were repaired by transverse preputial island flap (TPIF) and Bracka&#x 2032;s technique. Dorsal plication was not used as an <b>orthoplasty</b> modality. It was possible to repair 68. 89 &#x 0025; of the cases by Snodgrass repair. These patients either had no chordee or had superficial skin tethering (skin chordee) which resolved on degolving. All these cases were coronal, distal and mid penile hypospadias. Remaining cases were mid, proximal and penoscrotal with true fibrous chordee and were repaired by TPIF or Bracka&#x 2032;s technique. The Snodgrass technique had a fistula rate of 9. 67 &#x 0025;. Acceptably, low fistula rate and simple execution make the proposed modification of classical Snodgrass repair a viable option. The proposed algorithm proves to be a useful tool for standardised and logical preoperative decision making. It also defines indications of the three techniques vis-a-vis the type of hypospadias...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo our knowledge, ours is {{the largest}} single-center {{experience}} with diagnosis and management of acute arterial hemorrhagic and limb-threatening ischemic complications associated with total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MethodsBetween 1989 and 2002, 23, 199 TKA procedures (13, 618 total, 11, 953 primary, 1665 revision) and THR procedures (9581 total, 7812 primary, 1769 revision) were performed at the orthopedic service of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia. Arterial injuries were grouped according to type (ischemia, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, ischemia plus bleeding) and time of recognition of injury (0 - 5 days after <b>orthoplasty).</b> ResultsAcute arterial complications developed in 32 patients (0. 13 %), associated with 24 TKA procedures (0. 17 %) and 8 THA procedures (0. 08 %; P =. 0609). There were no deaths, and limb salvage was achieved in all patients. Arterial injury was detected by the orthopedic service {{on the same day}} (SD group) as performance of joint replacement in 18 patients (56 %), but was not recognized until the first to fifth postoperative day (PO group) in 14 patients (44 %). Arterial complications included acute lower-limb ischemia only in 18 patients SD group, 9; PO group, 9), bleeding only in 4 patients (SD group), arterial transection resulting in both ischemia and bleeding in 5 patients (SD group), and arterial pseudoaneurysm in 5 patients (PO group). Of the 18 patients with acute ischemia only, preoperative arteriography was performed in 12 patients (67 %), and 6 patients (33 %) were brought directly to the operating room because of advanced ischemia. Revascularization procedures in these 18 patients included bypass to the infrapopliteal artery (n = 7), popliteal artery (n = 5), or common femoral artery (n = 1); in only 5 patients (28 %) was thrombectomy alone successful. These 18 patients tended to require fasciotomy (4 of 9 vs 2 of 9; P =. 6199) and have foot drop (3 of 9 vs 1 of 9; P =. 5765) more frequently when ischemia was recognized after the day of surgery. Bleeding was managed with arteriorrhaphy. Arterial transection was treated with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 3), interposition grafting (n = 1), and below-knee popliteal bypass (n = 1). Popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm was treated with percutaneous methods (n = 3) or surgery (n = 2). ConclusionIn this series, risk for arterial injury associated with THA and TKA was remarkably low. Nonetheless, even at a high-volume orthopedic hospital, acute arterial injury was not recognized on the day of surgery in about half of patients. Judicious use of preoperative arteriography and aggressive revascularization are critical to achieving limb salvage. Simple arterial thrombectomy to treat ischemic complications of THA and TKA is rarely sufficient...|$|E
