Patients affected by both type 2 diabetes and epilepsy may be prescribed <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> an anti-epileptic drug such as phenytoin  concurrently. The {{aim of this study}} was to consider the interaction <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> with phenytoin in an experimental model. According to the result of this study, concurrent use <b>of</b> phenytoin <b>and</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> in clinic may cause therapeutic failure of phenytoin which may cause seizures and during seizures the cardiac function may be affected. Material and Methods: Two groups of rats were treated for 30 days. In group 1 (control group) saline (10 ml/kg) and phenytoin   (30 mg/kg) were administered daily by intragastric gavage. In group 2 (test group), pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) was administered daily 60 minutes before phenytoin  (30 mg/kg). Two hours after the last intragastric gavage, animals were anesthetized with ether and 2 ml of blood was drawn from the heart into a syringe containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and phenytoin  concentration in rat plasma was determined by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The study consisted of 2 groups of 10 male adult Wistar rats. Results: Compared with control group, concurrent use <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> phenytoin   was associated with significantly lower mean plasma concentrations of phenytoin : 2. 08 ± 0. 03  µg/ml VS 1. 2 ± 0. 02  µg/ml.

To prevent DDIs and their burden, the possible DDIs {{should be kept in}} mind. We know that the obesity predisposes to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, combinational uses of antiobesity drugs and glucose-lowering drugs are very common. As the hepatotoxicity <b>of</b> both <b>pioglitazone</b> (an antidiabetic drug) and orlistat (an antiobesity drug) has been shown in some cases, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the interaction <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> orlistat in human hepatocellular cell line human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG 2) cells to determine their effect on liver toxicity. Methods: Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated with 25 μM Pioglitazon (Pio), 20 μM Orlistat (Orl) pioglitazone, orlistat or combination of them. The MTT assay was used to assess cell viability. Results: <b>Pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> orlistat combination caused a loss of HepG 2 cell viability. While <b>pioglitazone</b> (25 μM) <b>and</b> orliatat (20 μM) alone decreased the cell viability around 91 % and 85 % respectively (notsignificant, P > 0. 05), the combination of these two drugs reduced the amount of viable cells to 55 % which was significant when compared with each drug alone (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) is {{commonly associated with}} both microvascular and macrovascular complications and a strong correlation exists between glycaemic control and the incidence and progression <b>of</b> vascular complications. <b>Pioglitazone,</b> a Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) ligand indicated for therapy of type T 2 DM, induces vascular effects that seem to occur independently of glucose lowering. Methods By using a hindlimb ischemia murine model, {{in this study we}} have found that pioglitazone restores the blood flow recovery and capillary density in ischemic muscle of diabetic mice and that this process is associated with increased expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Importantly, these beneficial effects are abrogated when endogenous Akt is inhibited; furthermore, the direct activation of PPARγ, with its selective agonist GW 1929, does not restore blood flow recovery and capillary density. Finally, an important collateral vessel growth is obtained with combined treatment with <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> selective PPARγ inhibitor GW 9662. Conclusion These data demonstrate that Akt-VEGF pathway is essential for ischemia-induced angiogenic effect <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> that <b>pioglitazone</b> exerts this effect via a PPARγ independent manner. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to find {{possible}} role <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> (PPARγ agonist) <b>and</b> fenofibrate (PPARα agonist) by Triton induced hyperlipidemia Model, Diet induced model and Relative organ weight analysis [...] The study revels that, both <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> fenofibrate has significantly reduced the elevated levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol in both atherogenic diet and triton induced hyperlipidemia at 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. Significant increase in HDL level was observed in animals treated with pioglitazone 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. and fenofibrate 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. in animals induced hyperlipidemia with atherogenic diet. The liver enzymes reveal that, there was significant reverse in ASAT levels in animals treated with pioglitazone 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. and fenofibrate 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. Histopathology reports also suggest that, there was a protection to liver and heart against atherogenic and triton induced damage. In combination therapy <b>of</b> both <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> fenofibrate in atherogenic diet and triton induced hyperlipidemia,there was no potentiation in their activity when they have administered in combination...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay method has been {{developed}} and fully validated for simultaneous quantification <b>of</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> candesartan in human plasma. Irbesartan {{was used as an}} internal standard. The analytes were extracted from human plasma samples by solid-phase extraction technique using a Strata-X 33 Â Î¼m polymeric sorbent. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on a C 18 column by using a 80 : 20 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 0. 1 % formic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0. 8 Â mL/min. The calibration curves obtained were linear (râ¥ 0. 99) over the concentration range of 15 â 3000 Â ng/mL for <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> 5 â 608 Â ng/mL for candesartan. The results of the intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. A run time of 2. 7 Â min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma samples per day. The proposed method was found to be applicable to clinical studies.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the drug-drug interaction between antidiabetic drugs and antifungal drugs. Interaction <b>of</b> <b>Pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> Rosiglitazone the known Thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs with Itraconazole (antifungal drug) was evaluated in alloxan induced diabetic rats. The blood samples were collected from diabetic rats at different time interval upto 24 hrs and blood glucose was estimated. Itraconazole (18 mg/kg, p. o.) pretreatment has significantly altered the onset of antidiabetic effect <b>of</b> <b>Pioglitazone</b> from 22. 70 % to 30. 89 % and significantly enhanced the peak antidiabetic effect from 56. 21 % to 68. 30 %. Similarly pretreatment with Itraconazole (18 mg/kg, p. o) has also significantly altered the onset of antidiabetic effect of Rosiglitazone from 26. 74 % to 30. 07 % and enhanced the peak antidiabetic effect from 45. 08 % to 58. 50 %. Duration of antidiabetic effect was raised from more than 24 hrs. This study indicates that Therapeutic drug monitoring has to be required to readjust the therapeutic dose of Itraconazole and Thiazolidinedione when they used concomitantly...|$|R
40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) is {{commonly associated with}} both microvascular and macrovascular complications and a strong correlation exists between glycaemic control and the incidence and progression <b>of</b> vascular complications. <b>Pioglitazone,</b> a Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) ligand indicated for therapy of type T 2 DM, induces vascular effects that seem to occur independently of glucose lowering. Methods: By using a hindlimb ischemia murine model, {{in this study we}} have found that pioglitazone restores the blood flow recovery and capillary density in ischemic muscle of diabetic mice and that this process is associated with increased expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).
