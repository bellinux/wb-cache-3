5|$|Ahead of Sina {{affecting}} the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, with wind gusts {{of up to}} , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests, however {{the extent of the}} damage was limited by {{the fact that many of}} the crops had already been harvested.|$|E
5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole. There are generally more females than males in each single year of age, except for the youngest ages (0–18) and late-30s and late-50s. Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 <b>or</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century. There is a large group of children under the age of five which reflecting high numbers of births in recent years. Births are up 20% since 2001, increasing from 14,427 to 17,423 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|On December 30, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed about 860km (535mi), to the northeast of Pago Pago in American Samoa. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south-southeast and gradually developed further, before the NPMOC designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P. During January 1, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it William as it passed near the Cook Island of Autitaki. During the next day William subsequently slowly accelerated as it passed near too or over several other Cook Islands and intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone. Early on January 3, TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 110km/h (70mph) as it passed near <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> French Polynesian islands of Maria and Rimatara.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{the name}} Able, the small {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} southeast and to the east while passing near <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Bahama Banks. Able subsequently turned to the northeast and later to the north, and finished executing its cyclonic loop on May 20. The hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20miles (32km) in diameter, and on May 21 Reconnaissance Aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h). Shortly thereafter Able passed about 70miles (110km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and early on May 22 Able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east. On May 23 it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters, and that night Able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520miles (840km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnant turned to the northeast before losing its identity late on May 24.|$|E
5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (<b>or</b> <b>over)</b> <b>the</b> Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, <b>or</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> northern tip of Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder {{is thought to have}} been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E

5|$|During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the north}} of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E
5|$|Starting on February7, {{tropical}} cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued {{for the northern}} Cook Islands under the anticipation of gale-force winds impacting populated islands. The first of these islands were Manihiki, Rakahanga, and Suwarrow. As the storm moved southward, the advisories shifted accordingly. Strong wind warnings were raised for Pukapuka, Nassau, and Penryhn on February8; however, they were dropped later that day as Cyclone Pat moved away. Alerts on potential gales in the southern Cook Islands also began on February8, including the islands of Atiu, Aitutaki, Manuae, Mitiaro, and Takutea. Gale warnings for Aitutaki, Palmerston, and Rarotonga began on February9 and extended to Mauke the next day. Early on February10, a hurricane warning was issued for Aitutaki. With the core of Pat's destructive winds forecast to pass close to <b>or</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> island, sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and gusts of 185km/h (115mph) were anticipated. The aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once Pat cleared the Cook Islands on February11 and {{was no longer a}} threat.|$|E
