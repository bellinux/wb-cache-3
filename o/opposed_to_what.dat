5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the place of {{creativity}} in the context of some philosophical arguments and in the context of psychoanalysis, appropriated by Donald Winnicott, considering its importance in the formation of the subject. At first the text is about creativity as an expression of power and vitality, incorporating readings of Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson and Deleuze. Then, we use the psychoanalytic perspective of Winnicott to think about the relationship between aggressiveness and creativity. We conclude that it is necessary to confront, challenge and openly <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was already given. Educating for creativity means encouraging the construction of a more autonomous individual profile more autonomous, critical, reflective, active, in short, a person with power of invention...|$|R

Bryan justified supporting the treaty by arguing that the issue of imperialism should be decided upon by the American people at the ballot boxes and not in Congress. However, when the Bacon Resolution (a proposed supplement to the Treaty of Paris which would allow the Filipinos a “stable and independent government") failed to pass, Bryan began publicly speaking out against the Republicans' imperial aspirations.|$|E

This {{was one of many}} attempts which Koestler made to gain acceptance within the mainstream of science, a strategy which brought him into conflict with individuals such as Peter Medawar who saw themselves as defending the integrity of science from outsiders.

25|$|German {{newspaper}} publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic {{aspects of the}} phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically U.S. moral failure, as <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.|$|E
