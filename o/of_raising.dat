40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Community are obliged to monitor the {{development}} of conservation status of natural habitats protected by the Habitats Directive. In Denmark a comprehensive programme on nature monitoring, called NOVANA, was launched in 2004. The monitoring programme is developed by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI). Raised bogs {{are one of the}} natural habitats included in the programme. This master thesis investigates how the nature monitoring <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs is organized in Denmark. Based on raised bogs’ unique ecology, it is assessed whether NERI’s approach to monitor raised bogs is adequate. The thesis focuses on application of methods to monitor vegetation ecology. As a part of this research project, two raised bogs, Skidendam and Holmegårds Mose, have been subjected to nature monitoring during autumn 2004. Similar nature monitoring was conducted in both bogs in 1987 and 1995. In order to examine the development of conservation status of the bogs over the time span, the results from the three sets of data are compared. The thesis takes in theories on ecology <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs, theories on organization of nature monitoring and theories on aggregation of monitoring data. It is concluded that the conservation status of Skidendam is favourable; that the conservation status of Holmegårds Mose is unfavourable. Moreover, it is concluded that NERI’s approach to nature monitoring <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs is inadequate. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs is based on an insufficient understanding of the special hydrological and morphological structure <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs. This has resulted in the use of inappropriate criteria for favourable conservation status <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring is organized against these criteria. Furthermore, the placement of sample plots to monitor vegetation ecology do not consider the inhomogeneous structure <b>of</b> <b>raised</b> bogs’ vegetation. Hence, the sampling design is unsuitable for raised bogs...|$|R
