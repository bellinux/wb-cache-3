5|$|The new {{structure}} {{is administered by}} a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. The {{first president of the}} metropolitan council, Patrick <b>Ollier,</b> a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million persons and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget; just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James <b>Ollier</b> in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E

Cassidy and Hall write that the phrase may be derived from all ye, all ye outs in free, all the outs in free, or possibly calling all the [...] "outs" [...] in free; in other words, all who are out may come in without penalty. Various calls used for such purposes have gone by the collective name of [...] "ollyoxalls" [...] in some places. Tukey and Rowell speculate that the phrase may be a corruption of a hypothetical and ungrammatical German phrase alle, alle, auch sind frei (all, all, are also free). Another possible origin might be the Greek language. Óloi óloi éxo (ολει ολει εξον) would translate to [...] "everybody everybody out." ...|$|R

25|$|When Saunders {{returned}} from Naivasha with the relief party, Mackinder had another attempt {{at the summit}} with <b>Ollier</b> and Brocherel. They traversed the Lewis Glacier and climbed the south east face of Nelion.

They reached the summit of Batian at noon on 13 September, and descended by the same route.|$|E
25|$|At {{its peak}} around 500 BC {{the size of}} the city would have been some 20,000–35,000 citizens, plus {{numerous}} helots and perioikoi. The likely total of 40,000–50,000 made Sparta one of the largest Greek cities; however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000–610,000, making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 5th century BC. The French classicist François <b>Ollier</b> in his 1933 book Le mirage spartiate ("The Spartan Mirage") warned that a major scholarly problem regarding Sparta is that all the surviving accounts were written by non-Spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of Sparta. Ollier's views have been widely accepted by scholars.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{mutations}} in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH1 {{have been found}} in several brain tumors including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma multiforme, with mutations found in nearly all cases of secondary glioblastomas, which develop from lower-grade gliomas, but rarely in primary high-grade glioblastoma multiforme. Patients whose tumor had an IDH1 mutation had longer survival. Furthermore, mutations of IDH2 and IDH1 were found in up to 20% of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are known to produce (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate. (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to very high concentrations which inhibits the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to a hypermethylated state of DNA and histones, which results in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Ultimately, this may lead to the types of cancer described above. Somatic mosaic mutations of this gene have also been found associated to <b>Ollier</b> disease and Maffucci syndrome.|$|E

Still, Mary Shelley believed the work was successful, and when she proposed another travel narrative, Rambles in Germany and Italy, to publisher Edward Moxon in 1843, she wrote [...] "my 6 weeks tour brought me many compliments".

2500|$|In October 1816, Clarke {{introduced}} Keats to {{the influential}} Leigh Hunt, {{a close friend}} of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of Poems, the first volume of Keats's verse, which included [...] "I stood tiptoe" [...] and [...] "Sleep and Poetry," [...] both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion. Clarke commented that the book [...] "might have emerged in Timbuctoo." [...] Keats's publishers, Charles and James <b>Ollier,</b> felt ashamed of the book. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey on Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers, Keats's new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists eventually included Coleridge, Hazlitt, Clare, Hogg, Carlyle and Lamb.|$|E
