He was carried <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E

He played through an undisclosed injury the following game, as the Canucks were eliminated by the Blackhawks by a 5–1 score. He completed the playoffs with a goal and six points in 12 post-season games.|$|E

We expect to see a strong coherent signal which is much higher than the incoherent one because of forward reflections from very smooth (particularly at L-band) and highly saline first year ice...|$|R

5|$|During his midget season, Crosby {{appeared}} on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to not wearing his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play {{so that he would}} not be recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} an atmospheric circulation pattern, known as the zonal wave three (ZW 3), in terms of <b>the</b> sea <b>ice’s</b> seasons from 1979 - 2009 {{in order to better}} understand the response of <b>the</b> sea <b>ice.</b> An index to represent the amplitude of the ZW 3 was calculated using zonal anomalies of 850 hPa geopotential heights taken from the ERA-Interim data set. Statistical analysis showed sea ice concentrations, taken from <b>the</b> Hadley sea <b>ice</b> and sea surface temperature data set, to be significantly dependent upon the ZW 3 in parts of the Ross Sea, <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> edge in <b>the</b> Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Amery <b>ice</b> shelf during <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> advance season. <b>The</b> results suggest that the ZW 3 plays a role in the occurrence of <b>the</b> observed sea <b>ice</b> trends in <b>the</b> Ross Sea, Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas, Weddell Sea and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Amery <b>ice</b> shelf regions during <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> advance season, <b>the</b> critical period for sea ice growth...|$|R

50|$|Under certain {{conditions}} of temperature and humidity, ice can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's evaporator coils. <b>The</b> <b>ice</b> buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, {{and can cause}} water damage if condensed water drips <b>off</b> <b>the</b> accumulated <b>ice</b> and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.|$|R

5|$|The 1924–25 season, {{the first}} year of NHL {{expansion}} to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and had died from appendicitis months after his final game. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold to the expansion Boston Bruins and replaced by Ed Gorman. It was also the debut season of Frank Finnigan. <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion New York Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{followed}} up their {{run to the}} Finals with their best regular season to that point. Calgary's 46–31–3 record in 1986–87 was good for third overall in the NHL, behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers. However, the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior, losing their first-round match-up with the Jets in six games. The season was also difficult <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> as 1986 first-round draft pick George Pelawa {{was killed in a}} car accident prior to the season's start.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, both on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and {{making it to the}} Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Three {{losses in}} four games, capped by a 5–0 defeat against the Boston Bruins on March 27 left the Flames six points {{out of the}} eighth and final playoff spot with seven games remaining.

However, a 5–3 road victory against the Eastern Conference leading Washington Capitals and a 2–1 home win against the Phoenix Coyotes, coupled with the Colorado Avalanche losing six of their final seven games to end the month of March, left the Flames two points behind the Avalanche heading into April.|$|E
5|$|A month {{following}} his trade, Jovanovski suffered a broken foot while blocking {{a shot in}} a game against the New Jersey Devils on February 9, 1999. Later in the season, he was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Shayne Corson. After being high-sticked in the face by Corson, the two players were sent <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> at which point Corson entered the Canucks' dressing room to verbally confront Jovanovski. According to Corson, the feud stemmed from comments Jovanovski had said about his family. As a result of entering the Canucks' dressing room, the Canadiens forward was later suspended five games by the NHL, in addition to one game for the high-sticking infraction. In 31 games with the Canucks that season, Jovanovski recorded two goals and 11 points. Combined with his games played with the Panthers, he totalled 27 points in 72 games.|$|E

Along with {{the other members of}} her rink, she had been previously awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina. In the fall of 2000, Schmirler was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. Schmirler and her team were inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame on two separate occasions, once in 1997 for winning three World Curling Championships and once in 2001 for winning the gold medal at the Olympics. At the annual Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the top player in the playoff round is awarded the Sandra Schmirler Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
