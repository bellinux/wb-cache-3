The effects of plasma damage are particularly studied by the performance of amorphous-silicon thin film transistors (a-Si TFTs), since it is strongly affected by the property of an interface between a gate insulating film and an a-Si film. It is found that the plasma damage at the interface affects on <b>off-current</b> of TFT, and that the <b>off-current</b> of Cat-CVD a-Si TFT is much {{lower than that of}} a-Si TFT in which all films are prepared by the conventional plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD).

Transistors for such application need to have high electrical performance and stability, as well as a high production output. In this dissertation we present an advanced multi-layer amorphous silicon thin-film transistor structure with a tailored channel region for the flat-panel display application. This specially tailored channel allows the rapid deposition of the TFT’s gate insulator and active material without significantly altering its electrical performance and characteristics. We first investigate the nominal film geometry that maximizes the production throughput of the transistor. We fabricate transistors with the conventional structure, and they show a field-effect mobility of 0. 95 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, threshold voltage of 1. 18 V, and subthreshold swing of 0. 46 V/dec.

However, our proposed TFT structure has a 40 % shorter deposition time, which provides it with a competitive edge due to its higher throughput.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon (a-Si:H) {{thin film transistor}} (TFT) {{has been used in}} active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and medical x-ray imagers, in which the TFT acts as pixel switches. However, instability of a-Si:H TFT is a major issue in applications where TFTs are also required to function as analogue circuit elements, such as in emerging organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. It is known that a-Si:H TFT shows drain current degradation under electrical operation, due to two instability mechanisms: (i) defect creation in the a-Si:H active layer, and (ii) charge trapping in the gate dielectric. Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) TFT has been proposed as a high performance alternative. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the design of nc-Si TFT and its outstanding issues, in the industry standard bottom-gate structure. The key for obtaining a stable TFT lies in developing a highly crystalline nc-Si active layer, without the so-called amorphous incubation layer. Therefore, processing of nc-Si by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is studied and PECVD parameters are optimized. It is shown that very thin (15 nm) layers with crystallinity of around 60 % can be obtained. Moreover, it is possible to eliminate the amorphous incubation layer, as transmission electron microscope (TEM) images showed that crystalline grains start growing immediately upon deposition at the gate dielectric interface. The nc-Si TFT reported in this work advances the state-of-the-art, by demonstrating that defect state creation is absent in the nc-Si active layer, which is deduced by performing several characterization techniques. In addition, with the proper design of the nitride gate dielectric, i. e. by using a nitrogen-rich nitride, the charge trapping instability can be minimized. Thus, it is shown that the nc-Si TFT is much more stable than the a-Si:H counterpart. Another issue with nc-Si TFT is its high drain leakage current, i. e. <b>off-current.</b> It is shown that <b>off-current</b> is determined by the conductivity of nc-Si active layer, and also affected by the quality of the silicon/passivation nitride interface. The <b>off-current</b> can be minimized by using a bi-layer structure so that a thin (15 nm) nc-Si is capped with a thin (35 nm) a-Si:H, and values as low as 0. 1 pA can be obtained.

The <b>off-current</b> decrease is attributed to i) blocking of the gate leakage current by the NAOS SiO 2 layer, and ii) improvement {{of the quality of}} the deposited oxide on the NAOS SiO 2 layer because of better nucleation, and consequently, the high on/off ration exceeding 109 is achieved. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|We present {{temperature}} dependent electrical {{measurements on}} InSb and InAs nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs). The FETs are fabricated from InAs/InSb heterostructure nanowires, where one complete transistor is defined {{within each of}} the two segments. Both the InSb and the InAs FETs are n-type with good current saturation and low voltage operation. The <b>off-current</b> for the InSb FET shows a strong temperature dependence, which we attribute to a barrier lowering due to an increased band-to-band tunneling in the drain part of the channel...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{field effect}} {{transistors}} {{based on the}} organic polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and inorganic zinc oxide were investigated. In this report we present {{one of the first}} studies on hybrid transistors employing one polymeric transport layer. The sol-gel processed ZnO was modified via Al doping between 0. 8 and 10 at. %, which allows a systematic variation of the zinc oxide properties, i. e. electron mobility and morphology. With increasing doping level we observe on the one hand a decrease of the electron mobilities by two orders of magnitude,on the other hand doping enforces a morphological change of the zinc oxide layer which enables the infiltration of P 3 HT into the inorganic matrix. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements confirm this significant change in the interface morphology for the various doping levels. We demonstrate that doping of ZnO is a tool to adjust the charge transport in ZnO/P 3 HT hybrids, using one single injecting metal (Au bottom contact) on a SiO 2 dielectric. We observe an influence of the zinc oxide layer on the hole mobility in P 3 HT which we can modify via Al doping of ZnO. Hence, maximum hole mobility of 5 e- 4 cm^ 2 /Vs in the hybrid system with 2 at. % Al doping. 5 at. % Al doping leads to a balanced mobility in the organic/inorganic hybrid system but also to a small on/off ratio due to high <b>off-currents.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Organic Electronic...|$|R
40|$|As {{continued}} MOSFETs scaling {{becomes increasingly}} challenging, solutions are urgently {{needed to meet}} the requirements of the ITRS roadmap. Schottky barrier-MOSFETs are promising alternative devices to current conventional MOSFET because the metallic source/drain contacts has many inherent advantages. However, generally Schottky barrier-MOSFET devices exhibit an inferior performance due to the high Schottky barrier at the source/drain contacts. In order to overcome this problem, lowering of the effective Schottky barrier of nickel silicide was investigated by dopant segregation at the silicide/Si interface, by the use of ultra-thin gate oxide and ultra-thin body SOI. Modelling of single-gated, fully depleted ballistic SOI Schottky barrier-MOSFET were performed with a self-consistent solution of the one-dimensional modified Poisson and Schroedinger equations. An essential difference be tween Schottky barrier and conventional MOSFET is that tunneling currents through the Schottky barriers play a crucial role. The simulation results show that the Schottky barrier width is strongly influenced by geometrical parameters, i. e., the thinner the gate oxide and the Si channel, the lower the effective Schottky barrier height. Devices with a few nanometers spatially extended highly doped layer directly at the simulated silicide/Si channel interface has a further improved inverse subthreshold slope close to the thermal limit 60 mV/dec. In addition, the on-currents were significantly increased. The reason for the dramatic improvement is that the conduction/valence bands are strongly bent due to the highly doped layer and hence the Schottky barriers for electrons becomes highly transparent resulting in an improved on-as well as <b>off-currents.</b> Before transforming this concept on the device, we investigated the fabrication of nickel silicide on ultra-thin SOI (10 nm) and the effect of silicidation induced dopant segregation on diode characteristics. Experimental results show that fully silicided nickel silicide on SOI has a low specific resistivity of 16 - 20 μΩcm. In addition, we observed that a high concentration of As/B segregated at the interface of nickel silicide and Si which lowers [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Our first {{objective}} was to contribute to PECVD technology by exploring its capability to fabricate high‐quality silicon dioxide gate dielectrics at low substrate temperatures. Our second {{objective was}} {{to contribute to a}} more exact understanding of PECVD technology by demonstrating that an accurate description of plasma parameters and chemistry can help researchers find optimal process conditions. We built a remote ICPECVD system to deposit thin SiO 2 dielectric films. The plasma state was determined using a Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy. The EEDF of Ar plasma in the reactor could largely be described by the Maxwell‐Boltzmann distribution function, but it also contained a fraction (10 ‐ 3) of electrons which were much faster (20 ‐ 50 eV). We demonstrated that ignoring this tail would result in significant modeling and interpretation errors. We modeled the composition of an Ar‐SiH 4 ‐N 2 O ICPECVD system. We used our simulations to predict the influence of the SiH 4 /N 2 O gas‐flow ratio and total gas pressure on the film’s electrical properties. We deposited silicon dioxide films in plasma conditions similar to those in the model. It appeared that the predictions we made through the model could be verified experimentally. Optimization led to the deposition of films with a high dielectric quality at a deposition temperature of only 150 °C. The films exhibited low leakage currents and a low midgap‐Dit. We showed the apllicability of our silicon dioxide films to low‐temperature TFTs by demonstrating their competitive mobility values and low <b>off‐currents.</b> The charge of our ICPECVD oxides appeared to be negative and a function of layer thickness. We demonstrated that two mechanisms contributed to the film growth and charge formation, namely plasma oxidation of the silicon substrate and chemical vapor deposition. We suggest that the first nm‐range of oxide thickness is formed by plasma oxidation that added a negative charge to the interfacial oxide layer, while the CVD component added a positive charge to the bulk oxide. We conclude that measuring actual plasma parameters in combination with an accurate description of plasma chemistry can help researchers reach optimal process conditions. The described method enables the fabrication of high‐quality silicon dioxide gate dielectrics using ICPECVD technology...|$|R
