5|$|She's Done it Again is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York. A thief named Sikes decides to rob a society woman who falsely {{claimed to have been}} robbed when she in fact pawned her jewelry. A gentleman thief strikes and robs her, but no <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> her. The thief is caught only by a clever detective. The film was the third release of the Thanhouser company and featured the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. The film was met with positive reviews, but is presumed to be lost.|$|E

As with her other dresses, it was archived, but went on display in 2011 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after being preserved by taxidermists {{as a type of}} jerky. Gaga explained following the awards ceremony that the dress was a statement about one's need to fight for what <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> in, and highlighted her distaste for the US military's don't-ask-don't-tell policy.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E

Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt.

The only fact that matters ({{from the point of view}} of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.|$|E

25|$|In 1979 {{there was}} a 90-day lockout by management, or a strike by union workers, {{depending}} on who <b>one</b> <b>believes.</b> Trains ran during this period {{because one of the}} unions, AFSCME, was then only an informal association known as BARTSPA, and management and BARTSPA had enough staff to keep trains running. One result of this strike is that the cost-of-living increases were greatly reduced to an amount far below the Consumer Price Index, and such raises are only received if no other raise occurs in a particular year.|$|E

Callum is found in the garden and is arrested. No <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> Sephy when she maintains that she was not raped. Callum has his trial and is sentenced to be hanged. Kamal tells Sephy that if she keeps her child, Callum will be hanged, but if she has the abortion, he will serve years in prison instead. Kamal makes a similar offer to Callum but also wants Callum to say publicly that he raped her. Both decide to keep the baby.|$|E

25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E
25|$|These {{barriers}} {{have also}} led some computer scientists {{to suggest that}} the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP. Therefore, if <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.|$|E
25|$|Stacey {{decides not to}} tell Ryan {{that he must be}} {{the father}} of her baby. He {{exhibits}} a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed {{to be part of a}} bet with his girlfriend Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Lily. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at The Queen Victoria pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now Jacqueline Jossa) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's death and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to Palma, Majorca, but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out, who poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Victoria. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of punters in The Queen Victoria, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no <b>one</b> <b>believes</b> her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.|$|E
