5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a favorite among fans, and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the}} most terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog. Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, {{as well as more}} difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin and sports games such as Joe Montana Football. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{characterization}} of the game's avatar will develop through storytelling, characters may also become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills, weapons, and magic. This creates a positive-feedback cycle that is central to most role-playing games: The player grows in power, allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges, and gain even more power. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the genre, where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers. Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately, the player in a role-playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience.|$|E

500|$|Another line of {{criticism}} of Belldandy relates to the sexual nature of the character, with Belldandy being described by one commentator as a [...] "soft porn goddess". Nevertheless, other commentators have observed that Belldandy might be , but writers such as Gilles Poitras note that the series—far from being soft porn—is in fact a very tender and romantic comedy: the characters {{do no more than}} simply kiss (and that infrequently) {{over the course of the}} series. Newitz suggests that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> Oh My Goddess! is the romantic nature of the story: [...] "In anime, romantic love is possible because overt sexuality is not". According to Newitz the relationships in romantic anime, such as Oh My Goddess!, are not about consummation but about [...] "sexual innuendo and deferral".|$|E

500|$|Praise from reviewers {{focused on}} the game's visuals and design, while {{criticism}} {{focused on the}} audio. Three of Zzap!64s reviewers—Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn—called the graphics [...] "amazing", well-executed, and [...] "varied"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick. Crashs reviewer called Spindizzy [...] "one of the most addictive" [...] ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared {{to the rest of}} the game, but was still described as good. Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics. Info gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a hot little number with much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> Marble Madness" [...] but better; [...] "Yep, it's a winner ... Recommended".|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

2500|$|Frank McNally, {{writing in}} honour of the author's 100th birthday, {{reflects}} on the breadth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the series of novels, {{for the quality of}} the writing and the relationships between the characters, which put them beyond the typical naval adventure, and gain interest from readers who [...] "wouldn’t touch Horatio Hornblower with a bargepole." [...] Lucy Eyre wrote to point out the appeal of the series to women readers, mentioning the nautical detail, and how it might be viewed the same as precise medical language on the television program ER.

2500|$|In smaller sizes, {{there is}} little or no {{difference}} in the availability of sleepers for boys and for girls. [...] However, the culturally perceived age-appropriateness of the blanket sleeper falls off more rapidly for boys than for girls, and sleepers for older boys are correspondingly less common than those for older girls, with the gap in availability increasing as the size increases. [...] (For older girls, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> wearing blanket sleepers may be based on the playful norm-flouting quality of wearing a garment traditionally worn only by younger children; for boys of the same age, this would tend to be considered less culturally acceptable.) [...] Nevertheless, sleepers for both boys and girls continue to have a reasonable degree of availability in department stores (and Internet auction sites) up to about size 14-16.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the advent}} of television, {{professional}} wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during the 1950s, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This {{was a time of}} enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a [...] "Golden Age" [...] for the wrestling industry. It was also a time of great change in both the character and professionalism of wrestlers as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> television. Wrestling fit naturally with television because it was easy to understand, had drama, comedy and colorful characters, and was inexpensive for production. From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the DuMont Television Network.|$|E
2500|$|Cody's {{two main}} {{allegations}} against {{his wife were}} that she attempted to poison him on multiple occasions (this allegation was later proved false) and that she made living in North Platte [...] "unbearable and intolerable" [...] for Cody and his guests.

Divorce laws varied from state to state in the early 1900s. Desertion was the main grounds for divorce, but in some jurisdictions, such as Kansas, divorce could be granted if a spouse was [...] "intolerable." [...] The Victorian ideal of marriage did not allow for divorce in any case, but the move westward forced a change in the expectations of husbands and wives and the ability to remain married.
