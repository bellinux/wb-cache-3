However, alternative models for marine terrace formation suggest that other types of physical and chemical weathering have a more {{central role in the}} formation of marine terraces than is widely acknowledged. Roering and Retallack (2012) concluded that the roles of subaerial physical and chemical weathering are significant, and {{played a major role in}} the formation of the terraces. In this study, weathering of beach cliffs and shore platforms associated with marine terraces at eight sites in two different locations along the central California Coast is assessed, and results are compared to those of Roering and Retallack. Findings for rock hardness along the profile of modern shore platform and cliff face are similar to the results from the Roering and Retallack study: the Schmidt rock hardness of cliff faces within the bottom 1. 5 meters above the modern shoreline angle are significantly lower than the rock hardness of the shore platform. <b>Oxidation</b> <b>color</b> of shore platforms, assessed using a Munsell color and described in Munsell color notation, is consistently within the Gley 1 range in both study areas.

40|$|A {{detailed}} mechanistic {{study on}} the Mukaiyama epoxidation of limonene with dioxygen as oxidant, bis(acetylacetonato) nickel(II) as catalyst, and an aldehyde as co-reagent is reported. All major products of the reaction have been quantitatively identified, both with isobutyraldehyde and 2 -methylundecanal as co-reacting aldehydes. Limonene epoxide is formed in good yield. The main products evolving from the aldehyde are carboxylic acid, CO(2), CO, and lower molecular weight ketone and alcohol (K + A). A mechanism is proposed in which an acylperoxy radical formed by the autoxidation of the aldehyde is the epoxidizing species. The observation {{of carbon dioxide and}} (K + A) in a 1 : 1 molar ratio supports this mechanism. CO(2) and (K + A) are formed in molar amounts of 50 - 60 % with respect to the amount of epoxide produced, indicating that epoxidation takes place not only via acylperoxy radicals but also via a peracid route. Cyclohexene epoxidation was also investigated with a number of different metal complexes as catalysts. Cyclohexene is very sensitive for allylic oxidation, which provides information about the action of the catalyst, e. g., metals that form strongly oxidizing stable high-valence complexes are more likely to induce allylic <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Color</b> changes in the reaction mixture indicate the presence of such high-valence species.

40|$|Pyroclastic {{deposits}} {{from four}} caldera volcanoes in the Kermadec arc have been sampled from subaerial sections (Raoul and Macauley) and by dredging from the submerged volcano flanks (Macauley, Healy, {{and the newly}} discovered Raoul SW). Suites of 16 – 32 mm sized clasts have been analyzed for density and shape, and larger clasts have been analyzed for major element compositions. Density spectra for subaerial dry-type eruptions on Raoul Island have narrow unimodal distributions peaking at vesicularities of 80 – 85 %, whereas ingress of external water (wet-type eruption) or extended timescales for degassing generate broader distributions, including denser clasts. Submarine-erupted pyroclasts show two different patterns. Healy and Raoul SW dredge samples and Macauley Island subaerial-emplaced samples are dominated by modes at ~ 80 – 85 %, implying that submarine explosive volcanism at high eruption rates can generate clasts with similar vesicularities to their subaerial counterparts. A minor proportion of Healy and Raoul SW clasts also show a pink <b>oxidation</b> <b>color,</b> suggesting that hot clasts met air despite 0. 5 to > 1 km of intervening water. In contrast, Macauley dredged samples have a bimodal density spectrum dominated by clasts formed in a submarine-eruptive style that is not highly explosive. Macauley dredged pyroclasts are also the mixed products of multiple eruptions, as shown by pumice major-element chemistry, and the sea-floor deposits reflect complex volcanic and sedimentation histories. The Kermadec calderas are composite features, and wide dispersal of pumice does not require large single eruptions. When coupled with chemical constraints and textural observations, density spectra are useful for interpreting both eruptive style and the diversity of samples collected from the submarine environment...|$|E

Five treatments including (1) control (none added), (2) 2. 5 ppm TA, (3) 5 ppm TA, (4) 10 ppm TA, and (5) 5 ppm butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were added to boneless, skinless ground chicken breast meat, and used for both raw and cooked meat studies. For the raw meat study, the ground chicken breast meat was packaged in oxygen-permeable bags and stored at 4 °C for 7 days. For the cooked study, raw ground meat samples were vacuum-packaged in oxygen-impermeable vacuum bags, cooked in-bag to the internal temperature of 75 °C, re-packaged in oxygen-permeable bags, and then stored. Both raw and cooked meats were analyzed for lipid and protein <b>oxidation,</b> <b>color,</b> and volatiles (cooked meat only) at 0, 3, and 7 days of storage. Raw meats with 10 ppm of TA added had significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) lower lipid and protein oxidation than other treatments during storage. In addition, TA at 10 ppm level maintained the highest color a*- and L*-values during storage. Cooked chicken breast meat with 5 and 10 ppm TA added produced significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) lower amounts of off-odor volatiles than other treatments. Among the volatile compounds, the amount of hexanal increased rapidly during storage for cooked meat. However, meats with 5 and 10 ppm TA added showed the lowest amount of hexanal and other aldehydes related to lipid oxidation, indicating a strong antioxidant effect of TA in cooked chicken breast meat. Furthermore, the differences in aldehydes among the treatments were bigger in cooked than in raw meat, indicating that the antioxidant effect of TA in cooked meat was greater than that in raw meat. Therefore, TA at > 5 ppm can be used as a good natural preservative in cooked chicken meat to maintain its quality during storage...|$|E

Molecular weights of about 3 000 Da were obtained indicating {{the formation of}} oligomers. The compounds are soluble in common organic solvents. P- 3, 6 exhibits blue, green or yellow fluorescence in toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or dichloromethane, respectively, whereas P- 2, 7 exhibits a blue fluorescence independent from the polarity of the solvent. Fluorescence quantum yields up to 68 % were found. Upon addition of divalent metal salts such as zinc, nickel or cobalt acetate, colour transitions involving isosbestic points occur. Titration experiments indicate the formation of 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 tpy : metal ion complexes. Organized films of the polymer–metal ion complexes can be prepared, if pretreated negatively charged substrates (quartz, ITO-coated glass) are sequentially dipped into a THF/DMF/n-hexane (1 : 0. 1 : 1, v/v) solution of the metal hexafluorophosphates and the THF/n-hexane (1 : 1, v/v) solutions of the polymers.

40|$|Emulsion-type raw {{and cooked}} pork sausage with {{different}} fat content or fatty acids {{was prepared to}} determine the effect of irradiation on lipid and cholesterol <b>oxidation,</b> <b>color</b> changes, and volatile production during storage. Lipid oxidation increased with the increase of fat content or irradiation dose in both raw and cooked pork products. Irradiated batters had higher cholesterol oxide content than non-irradiated, and the major cholesterol oxides formed in raw irradiated pork batters were 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol. Hunter a- and b-values of both raw and cooked pork products in aerobic packaging decreased with irradiation regardless of fat content. In vacuum packaging, however, irradiated cooked pork sausage had higher Hunter a-values than nonirradiated. Irradiation significantly increased the amount of 1 -heptene, 1 -nonene, and total volatile compounds in raw and cooked pork sausage. The amounts of 1 -heptene and 1 -nonene were not associated with TBARS values of pork sausage but were closely related to irradiation dose. In both irradiated and nonirradiated pork sausage, aerobic packaging produced more volatile compounds during storage than did vacuum packaging. The production of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols in aerobic-packaged pork sausage were not influenced by irradiation at O-day storage. However, irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation and increased the amounts of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols during storage. The TBARS of aerobic- or vacuum-packed sausage prepared with lard were higher (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the sausage prepared with flaxseed oil likely a result of the high tocopherol content in flaxseed oil;To investigate the distinction between volatile compounds related to oxidized flavor and irradiation odor, and to understand the mechanisms of off-odor production in irradiated meat on a chemical basis, oil emulsions containing amino acids or proteins were analyzed. The increase of aldehydes (e. g. hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the oil emulsion after irradiation indicated that irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation of the oil emulsion model system containing amino acids, glutathione, bovine serum albumin, gelatin, or myofibrillar proteins. Irradiation also produced new volatile compounds from amino acids (e. g., leucine, valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, and cysteine) via radiolytic degradation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lipid {{and protein}} oxidations are most {{important}} factors that can cause quality deterioration in fresh and cooked poultry meat during storage because many secondary compounds formed by lipid and protein oxidation can cause off-odor and off-flavor production in meat. Several synthetic antioxidants such as butylatedhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT), and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) have been successfully used to prevent the oxidative changes in meat. In recent years, however, growing number of consumers {{are more interested in}} natural antioxidants than synthetic ones because of the potential carcinogenic effects of the latter. Plant polyphenol extracts are known to have strong antioxidant and antimicrobial characteristics and have been used as preservatives in meat. Oregano essential oil and tannic acid are two examples of these polyphenol plant extracts that have strong antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the antioxidant effect of adding oregano essential oil, tannic acid, and/or their diffrent combinations to ground chicken meat, 2) to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of oregano essential oil, tannic acid, and/or their combinations in ground chicken meat, and 3) to evaluate the sensory characteristics of combined oregano oil and tannic acid in ground chicken meat. Ground chicken meat was prepared to study the effect of adding oregano oil and tannic acid in both raw and cooked meat patties. Several oregano oil and tannic acid concentrations were prepared to study their single and combination effects on meat quality. For the raw meat study, samples were individually packaged in oxygen-permeable bags and stored in a 4 Â°C cooler for up to 7 days. On the other hand cooked meat samples were packaged in oxygen-impermeable vacuum bags and then cooked in-bag reaching the internal temperature of 75 Â°C. After cooling to room temperature, the cooked meat was transferred to new oxygen-permeable bags and stored at 4 Â°C for up to 7 days. Chicken meat patties were analyzed for lipid and protein <b>oxidation,</b> <b>color,</b> and volatiles at 0, 3, and 7 days of storage. Parts of the samples prepared were also used for microbial studies. Oregano essential oil at level 400 ppm significantly reduced (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and off-odor volatiles, but improved color stability of raw ground meat. The effects of oregano oil on cooked meat were {{similar to that of the}} raw meat but the effects were greater than the raw meat. Hexanal was the major aldehyde and was decreased significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) by oregano oil treatment in cooked meat and the differences among the treatments were clearer in cooked meat than in raw meat. Overall, the addition of oregano essential oil at 100 - 300 ppm was a good way of preserving meat and could replace the synthetic antioxidant, BHA. Both raw and cooked chicken breast meat added with 10 ppm of tannic acid had significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) lower lipid and protein oxidation than other treatments during storage. In addition, tannic acid at 10 ppm level maintained the highest color a*- and L*-values during storage. Cooked chicken breast meat added with 3 ̆e 5 ppm tannic acid had significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) lower amounts of off-odor volatiles than control. Among the volatile compounds, the amount of hexanal in cooked meat increased rapidly during storage. Therefore, tannic acid at 3 ̆e 5 ppm could be used as a natural preservative in ground chicken meat to improve its quality during storage. The combination of 200 ppm oregano oil and 10 ppm tannic acid showed the highest effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) on TBARS, total carbonyl, and off odor volatile formation in both breast and thigh meat. The combination of 200 ppm of oregano oil and 10 ppm of tannic acid also showed the highest effect in stabilizing color values of both raw breast and thigh meats. Sensory evaluation of thigh chicken meat also indicated that 200 ppm of oregano oil and 10 ppm of tannic acid combination treatment had positive effects on most of the attributes evaluated. In conclusion, the combination of 200 ppm oregano oil and 10 ppm tannic acid could be a good replacement for the synthetic antioxidant in ground chicken meat. Oregano oil, tannic acid, BHA treatments reduced the APC significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) when used separately. However, combination of oregano + tannic acid showed the strongest (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) effect in reducing the APC in raw chicken breast meat during storage at 4 and 10 oC. The combination treatment also showed the strongest antimicrobial effects of all the treatments against Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriacea (ENT) in raw meat during storage. In cooked chicken breast meat, oregano oil and oregano + tannic acid combination were efficient (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in suppressing the growth of aerobic bacteria in meat at all temperatures (10, 25, and 43 oC) tested. Oregano essential oil treatment was more effective than the BHA and tannic acid treatments in slowing down the growth and survival of Stapylococcus aureus in cooked meat during storage at 10, 25, and 43 oC, but oregano oil + tannic acid treatment was more effective than the oregano oil alone. Based on these results it is suggested that oregano oil has a strong antimicrobial activity but its effect can be further improved when it is combined with tannic acid. This study demonstrated that oregano oil + tannic acid combination could be a good natural antimicrobial treatment to suppress most of the food borne pathogens in chicken meat. In conclusion oregano essential oil at 3 ̆e 200 ppm significantly improved meat quality and prevented meat deterioration during storage. Tannic acid at 10 ppm also improved meat quality and safety significantly during storage. However, the combination of 200 ppm oregano essential oil and 10 ppm tannic acid showed higher effect on both meat quality and safety of ground chicken meat than using them singly. This combination could be an excellent replacement for synthetic antioxidants such as BHA, BHT and TBHQ, which are commonly used for meat preservation...|$|E

Polyaniline (PA) has been synthesized and studied elec-trochemically (1, 2) since the first published escription in 1962. Recently there has been renewed interest in polyani-line because of its properties as a material for rechargeable batteries (3), modified electrodes (4), diodes and transistors (5), and electrochromic devices (6 - 10). Electrochemical studies of various aspects of polyani-line films have continued in recent years. Diaz and Logan (7) reported that polyaniline films prepared at constant po...|$|R

DC beef had higher pH (6. 6 vs 5. 7) and lower 24 h oxidation-reduction potential (– 190 vs – 108 mV) than controls, with higher cooked yield and cohesiveness, but lower beef flavor intensity scores. DC patties with lactic acid (LA) had acceptable cooked appearance and increased myoglobin (Mb) denaturation during cooking (77 %-LA; 63 %-normal control; 41 %-DC control), but a tangy off-flavor.

25|$|In an aqueous {{solution}} the color change exhibited {{can be used}} to test for distinguishing aldehydes from ketones. Aldehydes reduce dichromate from the +6 to the +3 <b>oxidation</b> state, changing <b>color</b> from orange to green. This color change arises because the aldehyde can be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. A ketone will show no such change because it cannot be oxidized further, and so the solution will remain orange.|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} review covers {{different aspects of}} lipid oxidation and protein oxidation in meat. The mechanism of lipid and protein oxidation, factors influencing lipid oxidation, the consequences of protein oxidation, measurement methods, and the interactions between lipid oxidation, protein <b>oxidation</b> and meat <b>color</b> are introduced. The present thesis was aiming to {{study the effects of}} different fatty acid composition on lipid oxidation, protein <b>oxidation</b> and meat <b>color</b> in minced pork stored in modified atmosphere packages (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) at 5 oC during 12 days of storage. The possible interactions between lipid oxidation, protein <b>oxidation</b> and meat <b>color</b> were also investigated. Minced meat differing in fatty acid composition was prepared by mixing lean minced meat and fat fractions obtained by dry fractionation. Three groups of minced meat were obtained, namely, more saturated, medium saturated and less saturated. Lipid and protein oxidation were measured by determining thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and free thiol content, respectively. Meat color measurement was performed using the Hunter L*, a*, b* system. The results showed that the less saturated group had higher oxidative stability in relation to lipid and protein oxidation than the more saturated and medium saturated groups, which might result from the balance between the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and the vitamin E content. This was supported by the finding that the less saturated samples contained more unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E than those in the more saturated and medium saturated groups. TBARS level was negatively related to free thiol content, indicating the presence of possible interactions between lipid and protein oxidation. Furthermore, a* values were found to be correlated to lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting likely interactions between these factors. However, color values were not influenced by fatty acid composition...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the color properties of different titanium oxide films, obtained by means of anodic <b>oxidation.</b> The <b>color</b> of these oxides varies with film thickness, since it is due to light interference phenomena taking place at the metal-oxide-air interfaces. Color measurements were carried out by using spectrophotometry techniques: the values obtained belong to the colorimetric space CIELAB, which is defined as standard colorimetric space. The results of these analyses {{were related to the}} oxide structure, analyzed with X-ray diffraction techniques, which was determined to be either amorphous or semicrystalline. Also the oxide thickness was taken into account. This feature was derived both from ellipsometric data and from reflectance spectra: the two data are shown to be in good adherence. Both commercial purity titanium (grade 2 ASTM) and titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrates were investigated...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} lipid <b>oxidation,</b> instrumental <b>color</b> evaluation, and {{sensory characteristics}} in cooked pork sausages containing anthocyanin rich colored potato (Solanum tuberosam cv. Shadow Queen) flakes (CPF). According to the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values, addition of 2 % CPF suppressed lipid oxidation (P < 0. 05) by 80 % {{compared to the}} control. The antioxidant activity of 2 % CPF was comparable to the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (0. 1 %) in cooked pork sausages. The L, a* values and odor, flavor, taste, texture and overall sensory quality did not significantly differ between control and 2 % CPF. Overall, cooked pork sausage with 2 % CPF was as acceptable to consumers as the control. Thus, the present study indicated that the addition of 2 % CPF was effective as a natural antioxidant for suppressing lipid oxidation in cooked pork sausages. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} effects of pre-slaughter penetrative and non-penetrative stunning and post-slaughter stunning on meat quality attributes in longissimus lumborum (LL) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles in heifers. Ten animals were assigned to each of four treatment groups: i) animals were subjected to conventional Halal slaughter (a clean incision through the structures {{at the front of the}} upper neck - the trachea, oesophagus, carotid arteries and jugular veins) and post-cut penetrating mechanical stun within 10 to 20 s of the neck cut (Unstunned; US); ii) high power non-penetrating mechanical stunning followed by the neck cut (HPNP); iii) low power non-penetrating mechanical stunning followed by the neck cut (LPNP); and iv) penetrative stunning using a captive bolt pistol followed by the neck cut (P). For each carcass, muscle samples were removed within 45 min of slaughter, portioned and analysed for pH, cooking loss, water holding capacity (WHC), tenderness (WBS), lipid <b>oxidation</b> (TBARS) and <b>color,</b> over a two week storage period. Stunning did not affect pH and cooking loss. Significant differences in water holding capacity, tenderness, lipid <b>oxidation</b> and <b>color</b> were present at different storage time points. HPNP stunning resulted in lower WHC and color values, particularly lightness (L*), higher TBARS values and peak force values compared with those stunned using LPNP, P and US. These adverse effects on quality were mostly encountered in the ST muscle. In conclusion, the meat quality achieved using P, LPNP and US treatments was comparable, and no treatment stood out as considerably better than another...|$|R
