5|$|Encouraged {{by artist}} John Singer Sargent, Sands studied {{painting}} in Paris at the Académie Carrière under Eugène Carrière for several years, beginning in 1894. There she met fellow student Nan Hudson, born Anna Hope Hudson in the United States, who became her life partner. During this time, Sands became the guardian <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> younger brothers following her mother's death in 1896.|$|E

5|$|On {{hearing that}} her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has {{died in a}} storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a {{previous}} marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes ("Con saggio tuo consiglio"). Agrippina obtains the support <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Caroline and {{her second}} husband {{divorced}} soon after, {{and she was able}} to keep the bulk of her wealth intact (though she settled on Durrieux a sum of one million dollars in order to retain custody <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> sons). Various suitors often in her entourage, such as Count Boni de Castellane and Gaston Bonnefoy, were reported to be engaged or interested in her, particularly after her divorce. She never remarried. Caroline's younger son died in 1914, but the elder lived a long, quiet life on his inherited wealth, dying in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Corkhill {{went back}} to serve at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Rouen on 16 June 1916 for the {{remainder}} of the year. On 23 January 1917, she went to England on leave until 9 February. She then served at the Australian Hospital until July 1918, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> leaves; to England in October 1917 and to Paris in February 1918. On 15 May 1918, Corkhill was sent to Abbeville to join the 3rd Australian General Hospital, and was briefly posted to the 38th British Casualty Clearing Station on 2 June. After serving in with the 3rd Australian General Hospital for a further two months, she was again posted to the Casualty Clearing Station on 21 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} grief {{caused by the}} death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to {{quite a bit of}} drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as drama theory. He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays.|$|E
50|$|An {{exhumation}} of {{the bodies}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> last <b>two</b> husbands revealed high levels <b>of</b> phosphorus. <b>Her</b> defence claimed the substance was contained in their medication.

The remains <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earlier <b>two</b> husbands were exhumed {{at a later date}} and pointed to the same cause of death. There was no reason, however, to have a second trial.|$|R

5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> {{favorite}} vibrators, {{and called it}} a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever being threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E

5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene on one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also {{eager for a}} match between one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E
5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hesperus was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{that had}} originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name Juruena in the late 1930s, but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939, commissioned in 1940 as HMS Hearty though quickly renamed. She was damaged by German aircraft during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols after her repairs were completed. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties in late 1940. She was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force the next month for escort duties in the North Atlantic. Hesperus was transferred to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in late 1941 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next three years. She was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1943 after suffering damage from one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> ramming attacks that sank German submarines. The ship sank two other submarines during the war by more conventional means. After the end of the war, Hesperus escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid-1946. She was scrapped beginning in mid-1947.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband {{ascended the}} throne as King George V, {{and she became}} queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> {{official}} names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring {{not to take the}} name of her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at Westminster Abbey. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, Queen Alexandra. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving Buckingham Palace, and kept some of the royal jewels that should have been passed to the new Queen.|$|E
5|$|Rai had six film {{releases}} in 2000, including Kandukondain Kandukondain, a Tamil {{adaptation of}} Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility, and Aditya Chopra's romantic drama Mohabbatein. In 2002, Rai played opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Bhansali's period romance Devdas, {{an adaptation of}} the novel of the same name. Her performance in the top-grossing production earned her a second Best Actress award at Filmfare. In 2003, Rai played the lead role in Rituparno Ghosh's Bengali film Chokher Bali, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, which {{proved to be a}} success. However, the failure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> Hindi film releases of the yearDil Ka Rishta and Kuch Naa Kaholed to a setback in her Bollywood career. The following year, Rai played a character based on Elizabeth Bennet in a Bollywood-style adaptation of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, entitled Bride and Prejudice, an English language British production directed by Gurinder Chadha. Also in 2004, she reunited with Ghosh to play a depressed woman in the drama Raincoat.|$|E

5|$|She was {{converted}} into a guard ship on 28 June and stationed in Cattaro Bay, {{the same day that}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, the catalyst for the start of World War I a month later. She served in that role until June 1917. She returned to the cadet training school, and on 18 June left Cattaro for Pola. At 12:55 while cruising off the island of Lacroma, an accidental explosion tore a large hole in the bow, though the damage was above the waterline, allowing Zara to make port in Ragusa. The shipyard there effected temporary repairs to ensure her hull was strong enough to allow her to continue on to Pola, which she reached on 26 June. In Pola, a commission determined that the cause of the explosion was a badly deteriorated warhead in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> torpedoes, though some later sources state she struck a naval mine. After her bow was permanently repaired, Zara served in the training school {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. With Austria-Hungary's defeat, the Allies seized most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet as war prizes, and Zara was allocated to Italy, which scrapped her by 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{dominated}} the ice hockey competition, winning every match {{to take their}} sixth Olympic gold in eight Winter Games. East German sledders fully demonstrated their prowess at the Trebević track. Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer clinched gold in both bobsleigh events, while Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musiol secured both silvers. Led by Steffi Martin, who won the first <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> back-to-back Olympic titles, East German lugers swept the women's singles medals. This show of strength was also observed in the women's speed skating, where East German athletes grabbed nine of the twelve medals in dispute. Four of these were won by Karin Enke (matching the total tallies of Hämäläinen and Svan), and three by Andrea Schöne – in direct competition with Enke. Speed skater Gaétan Boucher won three of Canada's four medals in Sarajevo, including two golds.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political and moral objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>two</b> failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not.|$|E
