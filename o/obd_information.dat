[12] {{proposed}} ad hoc on-demand multi-path {{distance vector}} by speed metric (S-AOMDV) scheme combined with hop rate metric to make vehicle routing information available for employment {{and to reduce}} the latency of routing decisions. To get speed information for real time, authors designed an on-board diagnostic (<b>OBD)</b> <b>information</b> cluster module and results using an OBD technology to gather speed information which increase in energy consumption and routing overhead; therefore, in case of highly dynamic traffic or high load broadcast, the performance of S-AOMDV will be low due to hop and velocity metric combination to make routing selection. To evaluate the generated routes, Alghamdi [13] and Alves and Wille [14] proposed load-balancing AOMDV scheme according to the maximum node residual energy and existing number of packets. This scheme mainly utilizes the available routing information in the existing AOMDV protocol. As a result, during the computation of maximum nodal residual energy in the routing, it significantly increases the routing control overhead and end-to-end latency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{a number of recent}} works have studied the classic {{communication}} problem INDEX, and its variant AUGMENTED-INDEX, from a tradeoff perspective: how much communication can Alice (the player holding the n data bits) save if Bob (the player holding the index) communicates a nontrivial amount? Recently, Magniez et al. (STOC, 2010), Chakrabarti et al. (FOCS, 2010) and Jain and Nayak gave information cost tradeoffs for this problem, where the amount of communication is measured as the amount of information revealed by one player to the other. The latter two works showed that reducing Alice’s communication to sublinear requires at least a constant amount of communication from Bob. Here, we show that the above result is just one point on a more general tradeoff curve. That is, we extend the earlier result to show that, for all b, either Bob reveals Ω(b) information to Alice, or else Alice reveals n/ 2 <b>O(b)</b> <b>information</b> to Bob. This tradeoff lower bound is easily seen to be everywhere-tight, by virtue of an easy two-round deterministic protocol. Our lower bound applies to constanterror randomized protocols, with information measured under an “easy ” distribution on inputs. ...|$|R

For recreationists, the sudden transition to backcountry avalanche conditions poses a risk management challenge. For resorts, the content and presentation of out-ofbounds (<b>OB)</b> hazard <b>information</b> presents a risk communication challenge. The goals of this project were {{to gain a better understanding}} of avalanche awareness among OB users and to identify effective strategies for informing their decisions in OB avalanche terrain. Because the OB phenomenon is multi-faceted and complex, we used a mixed-methods, multilevel ecological approach involving focus groups, intercept surveys, expert interviews, site visits, and a retrospective accident analysis. Qualitative analysis supported a precautionary stage model consisting of five general categories of OB user. Since each of these categories is characterized by a unique orientation towards risk, it appears likely that each category is best targeted by specific interventions. We conclude by presenting a preliminary framework for resort operators that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of common OB risk communication problems...|$|R

A total of 86 mothers of bulls of Slovak Pinzgau cattle were use in this study. To genotype of cows for candidate genes we used PCR methods (PCR-RFLP, ARMS-PCR, multiplex PCR-RFLP). On the basis of PCR analyses we established genotype structure of cattle population and calculated allelic frequencies. Effectiveness of allele incidence and genetic diversity was evaluated with following parameters: theoretical heterozygosity (He exp), experimental heterozygosity (He <b>obs),</b> polymorphism <b>information</b> content (PIC), expected homozygosity (E), effective number of alleles (ENA), level of possible variability realization (V%). Slovak Pinzgau cattle exhibit the high values of heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, effective number of alleles and level of possible variability realization for genes CSN 2, CSN 3 and LALBA. In opposite, for genes CSN 1 S 1 and LGB show high values of homozygosity...|$|R

Reducing the explosion of state space is necessary to make compile-time analysis feasible. This state space explosion problem is relieved first by eliminating redundant interleaving, through the stubborn set theory.

The similarity of patterns was assessed by cross-correlation analysis.

40|$|When taking aerial images, it is {{important}} to know locations of specific points of interest in an Earth-centered coordinate system (latitude, longitude, height). The correspondence between a pixel location in the image and its Earth coordinate is known as georegistration. There are two main technical challenges arising in the intended application. The first is that no known features are assumed to be available in any of the images. The second is that the intended applications are real time. Here, images are taken at regular intervals (i. e. once per second), and it is desired to make decisions in real time based on the geolocation of specific objects seen in the images as they arrive. This is in sharp contrast to most current methods for geolocation that operate "after-the-fact" by processing, on the ground, a database of stored images using computationally intensive methods. The solution is a nonlinear estimation algorithm that combines processed realtime camera images with vehicle position and attitude <b>information</b> <b>ob</b> tained from an onboard GPS receiver. This approach provides accurate georegistration estimates (latitude, longitude, height) of arbitrary features and/or points of interest seen in the camera images.

40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{organization of}} receptor neuron {{input into the}} olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> allows odor <b>information</b> to be transformed into an odorant-specific spatial map of mitral/tufted (M/T) cell glomerular activity at the upper level of the OB. In other sensory systems, neuronal representations of stimuli can be reorganized or enhanced following learning. While the mammalian OB {{has been shown to}} undergo experience-dependent plasticity at the glomerular level, it is still unclear if similar representational change occurs within (M/T) cell glomerular odor representations following learning. To address this, odorant-evoked glomerular activity patterns were imaged in mice expressing a GFP-based calcium indicator (GCaMP 2) in OB (M/T) cells. Glomerular odor responses were imaged before and after olfactory associative conditioning to aversive foot shock. Following conditioning, we found no overall reorganization of the glomerular representation. Training, however, did significantly alter the amplitudes of individual glomeruli within the representation in mice in which the odor was presented together with foot shock. Further, the specific pairing of foot shock with odor presentations lead to increased responses primarily in initially weakly activated glomeruli. Overall, these results suggest that associative conditioning can enhance the initial representation of odors within the OB by enhancing responses to the learned odor in some glomeruli...|$|R
40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb (<b>OB)</b> receives odor <b>information</b> from the olfactory epithelium and relays {{this to the}} olfactory cortex. Using a mouse model, we found that development and maturation of OB interneurons depends on the zinc finger homeodomain factor teashirt zinc finger family member 1 (TSHZ 1). In mice lacking TSHZ 1, neuroblasts exhibited a normal tangential migration to the OB; however, upon arrival to the OB, the neuroblasts were distributed aberrantly within the radial dimension, and many immature neuroblasts failed to exit the rostral migratory stream. Conditional deletion of Tshz 1 in mice resulted in OB hypoplasia and severe olfactory deficits. We therefore investigated olfaction in human subjects from families with congenital aural atresia that were heterozygous for TSHZ 1 loss-of-function mutations. These individuals displayed hyposmia, which is characterized by impaired odor discrimination and reduced olfactory sensitivity. Microarray analysis, in situ hybridization, and ChIP revealed that TSHZ 1 bound to and regulated expression of the gene encoding prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR 2), a G protein-coupled receptor essential for OB development. Mutations in PROKR 2 lead to Kallmann syndrome, characterized by anosmia and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Our data indicate that TSHZ 1 is a key regulator of mammalian OB development and function and controls the expression of molecules involved in human Kallmann syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is an {{irreversible}} {{lung disease}} characterized by progressive fibrosis {{in the small}} airways with eventual occlusion of the airway lumens. OB is most commonly associated with lung transplant rejection; however, OB has also been diagnosed in workers exposed to artificial butter flavoring (ABF) vapors. Research has been limited {{by the lack of}} an adequate animal model of OB, and as a result the mechanism(s) is unclear and there are no effective treatments for this condition. Exposure of rats to the ABF component, 2, 3 -pentanedione (PD) results in airway lesions that are histopathologically similar to those in human OB. We used this animal model to evaluate changes in gene expression in the distal bronchi of rats with PD-induced OB. Male Wistar Han rats were exposed to 200 ppm PD or air 6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 2 -wks. Bronchial tissues were laser microdissected from serial sections of frozen lung. In exposed lungs, both fibrotic and non-fibrotic airways were collected. Following RNA extraction and microarray analysis, differential gene expression was evaluated. In non-fibrotic bronchi of exposed rats, 4683 genes were significantly altered relative to air-exposed controls with notable down-regulation of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, in fibrotic bronchi, 3807 genes were significantly altered with a majority of genes being up-regulated in affected pathways. Tgf-β 2 and downstream genes implicated in fibrosis were significantly up-regulated in fibrotic lesions. Genes for collagens and extracellular matrix proteins were highly up-regulated. In addition, expression of genes for peptidases and peptidase inhibitors were significantly altered, indicative of the tissue remodeling that occurs during airway fibrosis.

40|$|Olfactory {{information}} is utilized {{for a variety}} of behaviours including feeding, migration and spawning. The olfactory bulb is the initial site of odour information processing in the central nervous system. The <b>OB</b> organizes this <b>information</b> along parallel processing pathways using topographic and temporal coding. In general, {{little is known about the}} neural substrate involved in transforming olfactory information into behavioural responses. In the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) the responses of olfactory sensory neurons in the peripheral olfactory organ are transmitted along two distinct pathways to the medial and non-medial regions of the OB. The neural substrate for olfactory-locomotor transformation was recently identified in the sea lamprey, and demonstrated that projection neurons (PNs) in the medial OB region initiated movements by connecting to locomotor control centers. In contrast, PNs in the non-medial OB region projected to forebrain regions including the pallium. This thesis examines previously unknown anatomical and physiological characteristics of PNs in these medial and non-medial OB regions and relates the findings to these functionally distinct parallel output pathways. The medial PNs were anatomically isolated within the glomerular neuropil, exhibited varied somal shape, and had larger somata than non-medial PNs. Furthermore, the bulbar region containing these medial PNs responded to several different classes of odours with local field potentials (LFPs) being a mixture of transient and sustained responses and relatively short multiunit responses. The somata of non-medial PNs were below the glomerular neuropil and also exhibited varied shapes, but were smaller than the somata of the medial PNs. The LFP and multiunit recordings suggested that within the non-medial OB region, the dorsal territory responded differentially to lamprey sex pheromones and migratory pheromones while lateral recordings exhibited sustained LFP responses and long multiunit responses largely to basic amino acids. These findings suggest that neural organization in the medial OB may be optimized for the initiation of olfactory-locomotor movements in response to diverse odours, while the nonmedial regions exhibit odour specificity and may be optimized for other functional processes such as odour information integration...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} almost all MS {{patients}} receive some kind of immunomodulatory therapy, possible misdiagnoses should be avoided at all means. Therefore the German treatment consensus group insists that the diagnosis of MS should include both MRI and testing for oligoclonal bands (OB) in the cerebrospinal fluid. With modern isoelectric focusing (IEF) techniques OB can be detected in 95 - 100 % of patients with clinically definite MS. The literature on MS cases with negative OB is scarce and inconclusive. Most investigations {{have been carried out}} with inadequate methods and/ or insufficient sensitivity. Our objective was to define the frequency of OB negative MS patients in larger case material and to further analyse the differences concerning age at onset, gender, disease course, progression and disability after follow-up between OB negative and OB positive MS patients. Methods: The MS data bank MUSIS of the Jewish hospital in Berlin was reviewed for MS patients, whose CSF and serum had been analysed for oligoclonal IgG bands by IEF between 1995 and 2003. 1827 patients with a diagnosis of MS were identified. CSF analysis of the 70 OB negative MS patients had been performed at N= 24 different laboratories. Gender, age at onset, duration of disease, course of disease and severity (expanded disability status scale, EDSS) were extracted from the data base. Patient follow-up was assessed up to October 2003 and ranged from 1 year to 51 years (mean 14. 8, ± 8. 4 SD). Further we compared two matched groups of patients - 70 OB negative MS patients versus 70 OB positive MS patients. Matching was performed in the following manner. For each OB negative case we identified a OB positive MS patient of the same gender, age at onset, duration of disease, and of the same diagnostic category. Matching of the RRMS (relapsing and remitting MS) patients to SPMS (secondary progressive MS) was permitted. The patient closest to the index case was selected. Results: In 151 / 1827 (8. 3 %) patients with a tentative diagnosis of MS no OBs were found. Among these 62 had possible MS, six turned out to have an alternative diagnosis (cerebral vasculitis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Polyneuritis and Myelitis, hydrocephalus internus due to aqueduct stenosis, Morbus Wilson and autoimmun triggered polyneuropathy) and 13 patients had changed to OB positive on a repeat lumbar puncture, leaving 70 patients with definite MS and no OBs (3. 8 %). Differences between the 70 OB negative and 70 positive MS patients were found regarding EDSS (2. 7 versus 3. 8, p< 0. 00001) and progression index (0. 30 versus 0. 43, p< 0. 01). Discussion: We find that clinical definite MS without OB is rare (3. 8 %), and should be diagnosed with caution (only 46. 4 % of all OB negative MS patients were definite MS patients). Despite the problems of a retrospective data collection concerning selection bias and incomplete documentation in medical records, the matched group of positive MS patients represents a good selection of all OB positive MS patients. MS patients in the OB negative group were significantly less disabled than the matched OB positive MS patients (EDSS 2. 7 vs. 3. 8 p 95 % positive OB results for definite MS patients are acceptable. According to this criterion all the data (except Bergamanschi et al., 2004 and Zeman et al., 1996) in table 1 have to be considered as inadequate. The considerable difficulties associated with the alleged absence of OB are vividly illustrated in the report of Zeman et al. Initially 34 / 290 (11. 7 %) were found to be OB negative, but subsequent reinspection of the foils led to a revision from negative to positive in 14 patients. For eight other patients a new diagnosis was established and 3 / 6 patients with a repeat lumbar puncture showed OBs on the second occasion. Altogether only 9 / 290 (3. 1 %) remained with trustful negative OB. OBs may sometimes be absent in a small percentage of patients at initial presentation such as optic neuritis (Söderström et al., 1998) or in children (Sindern et al., 1992) and become positive {{in the course of the}} disease. The conversion from negative to positive OB was also observed by us for 13 definite MS patients who underwent a second lumbar puncture. However, in most of the cases the change in the OB rating may be explained by a better performance of the second laboratory (11 / 11 reexamined at the neurochemical laboratory of the medical school Hannover were found to be positive), rather than by the development of an intrathecal IgG response. The minimum number of OB chosen as cut-off may also influence the percentage of MS patients with negative OB. Most authors demand 2 - 3 OB for a positive rating. The disappointingly low frequency of only 76 % OB positive MS patients (Pirttilla et al., 1995) may be explained by the unusually high cut-off of 5 OB. Conversely patients with only 1 OB are negative by definition, but show an increased propensity to develop a complete oligoclonal pattern on a repeat lumbar puncture (Davies et al., 2003). Interestingly 4 of the 13 MS patients (30. 8 %) without OB who were investigated at the Medical School Hannover displayed one <b>OB.</b> <b>Information</b> on the remaining 57 OB negative MS patients was not available from the other laboratories. Despite the drawback that the results for OB had to be assembled from N= 24 different laboratories, the proportion of definite MS patients with negative OB was remarkably low with only 70 / 1827 (3. 8 %). Thus OB negative CDMS is rare and should be diagnosed with caution. In six patients the absence of OB prompted reconsideration of the initial diagnosis of MS which was substituted by cerebral vasculitis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), polyneuritis and myelitis, hydrocephalus internus due to aqueduct stenosis, Morbus Wilson and autoimmun triggered polyneuropathy. If OBs are lacking it is recommended to repeat the laboratory investigations because (1) a false negative result may probably have been reported by a laboratory with suboptimal performance, or (2) an alternative diagnosis should be considered, or (3) OB may develop with time in patients with a short course of suspected MS. Our study supports the conclusion of previous studies [Stendahl-Brodin et al., 1980; Zeman et al., 1996] that the prognosis of true OB negative MS patients is relatively benign. Different neuropathological patterns have recently be defined in MS (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) and it remains to be seen, if MS patients without OBs can be allocated to a certain subgroup. Subanalysis: CSF analysis in 205 patients with multiple sclerosis. Relevance of the number of oligoclonal bands, interrelation of CSF variables and correlation with clinical data Background: Currently investigations of the CSF of patients with MS are gaining renewed interest. While modern methods of CSF analysis are indispensable for making an early and secure diagnosis, they may also turn out to be of value in predicting clinical disease course and response towards different therapies. However, it is rarely recognized that common CSF parameters may show a considerable degree of interrelation. The recently suggested parameter "number of oligoclonal bands" was tested for such dependencies and the correlation of common CSF variables with clinical data was investigated. Methods: In a retrospective analysis the clinical data for 205 patients with definite MS and positive oligoclonal bands (OB) were extracted from the MUSIS data bank at the Jewish Hospital Berlin. Identification of the oligoclonal band pattern was carried out by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels with silverstaining in one laboratory. Counting of bands was always performed by the same person (U. W.). Results: Mean age of the 144 women and 61 men at the time of lumbar puncture was 41. 2 (SD: 11. 6) years. Mean cell count amounted to 4. 9 /µl with 65 / 174 (37. 4 %) showing more than 4 cells/µl. EDSS score at follow-up correlated negatively with the number of cells (r = - 0. 292), but not with the number of OB. The CSF/serum quotient for albumin (blood-CSF-barrier) showed a significant correlation with EDSS (r = 0. 234, p = 000. 1) and was higer in men than in women (p = 0. 017). The mean number of CSF restricted OB was 15. 2 (SD: 7. 8), with a minimum of 2 (set cut-off) and a maximum of 34 OB. Only 7 / 205 (3. 4 %) had less than 4 OB. Additional identical OB in serum (oligoclonal pattern type 3) were encountered in 69 / 205 (33. 7 %), but only 25 / 205 (12. 2 %) displayed at least 4 or more identical OB. The mean IgG index was 0. 943 and in 119 / 205 (58 %) it was higher than the usual limit of 0. 700. The number of OB correlated closely with the IgG index (r = 0. 671, p< 0. 0001) and more weakly with the cell count (r = 0. 292). It showed a slight decrease with age (r = - 0. 192). Conclusion: Comparisons between different methods must consider that the number of OB depends (i) on the resolution of the gels and (ii) on the amount of intrathecally synthesized IgG. CSF analysis has the potential to assist in prognosis and therapy, but a multifactorial approach must be used, including parameters for demyelination, neuronal and axonal damage...|$|R
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} olfactory system, each olfactory neuron expresses {{only one}} of about 1, 000 different odorant receptor genes. In the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory neurons expressing the same receptor are scattered, but their axons converge into a few topographically fixed glomeruli, the specialized synaptic structures in the olfactory bulb (OB). Consequently, a stereotyped spatial map is constructed {{on the surface of}} the OB, in which about 1, 800 glomeruli are orderly arranged in mice. The physiological and anatomical studies show that the glomeruli receiving similar odorant molecules are grouped together and form a special domain on the <b>OB.</b> The <b>information</b> converged in the glomeruli is transmitted to the second-order neurons, mitral and tufted cells in the OB. These neurons project axons caudally and construct the lateral olfactory tract (LOF) {{on the surface of the}} ventrolateral telencephalon. The LOT axons eventually sprout collateral branches invading the olfactory cortex and form connections with the third-order neurons. The olfactory cortex consists of morphologically distinct areas such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex (PC), the olfactory tubercle (OT), the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala. Each second-order neuron projects to the multiple target areas with massive sprouting of collateral branches. In contrast to the clear rule of the peripheral olfactory projection, the principal of central olfactory projection is obscure. Although a few studies suggest specific targeting of the projections from second-order neurons in the olfactory cortex, there is not a point-to-point topographic relationship between the spatial map on the OB to any of the olfactory cortical areas, as other sensory systems. For example, the retrograde axonal labeling shows that a single cortical region receives inputs from the mitral/tufted cells scattering over the OB. The anterograde axonal tracing also shows that the spatial arrangement in the OB is not reflected in the olfactory cortical areas. Furthermore, there is the evidence that the spatial representation of the OB is already lost in the LOT, in which mitral/tufted cell axons are intermingled randomly regardless of the position of their cell bodies. In the present study, I demonstrated that c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed on a fasciculated subset of axons in the LOT at each developmental stage. Their c-kit-expressing cell bodies were distributed in the intermediate zone flanked between the ventricular zone and the mitral cell layer in the OB. BrdU-labeling experiment showed that the newly-differentiated mitral/tufted cells radially migrating in the intermediate zone transiently expressed c-kit so that, the expression of c-kit is always fixed in the intermediate zone. These results indicate that mitral/tufted cell axons projecting at the same developmental stage are grouped together and constitute a special assembly within the LOT bundle, regardless of the position of their cell bodies in the OB. The newly elongating c-kit-positive axons usually occupied the ventral surface area in the LOT. Therefore, there seems to be a developmental gradient in the organization of LOT axons from the dorsal depth to ventral surface. These results together with the previous axonal tracing studies suggest, that arrangement of LOT axons is not, based on the topographical position of the cell bodies but the developmental status of the axons. The OT is one of the olfactory cortical areas that receive the late innervation by OB axons. The OT receives a heavier projection from tufted cells the late-born projection neurons in the OB. In later developmental stages, many c-kit-positive axons were observed to project into the OT selectively and directly. This observation further supports that the OT receives the selective projection from the late-born projection neurons in the OB. In the LOT, c-kit-positive axons were always fasciculated and segregated from c-kit-negative axons. When OB explants were cultured in the dish, c-kit-positive neturites did not fasciculate but randomly mixed with c-kit-negative neurites. Even in the organotypic co-culture, c-kit-positive axons did not choose the superficial part but randomly elongated within the LOT bundle, intermingling with c-kit-negative axons. Thus, the selective fasciculation of c-kit-positive axons in the LOT was not, reproduced in culture and might require developmentally ordered projection of LOT axons. The c-kit is encoded by the Wlocus in mice and the ligand for c-kit is stem cell factor(SCF), which encoded by the Sllocus in mice. The interaction between c-kit and SCF is considered to be essential for the development of melanocytes, erythrocytes, mast cells and germ cells, because mutations in either the W or Sl locus result in serious defects in differentiation of these cells. I examined whether c-kit or SCF was involved in the projection of LOT axons. However, I did not detect any abnormality in the LOT projection of W/W or Sl/Sl d mutant mice, although it is still possible that more detailed analyses reveal some function of this signaling...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listing rule 3. 1 {{requires}} {{listed companies}} to immediately disclose price sensitive {{information to the}} market via the ASX’s Company Announcements Platform (CAP) prior to release through other disclosure channels. Since 1999, to improve the communication process, the ASX has permitted third-party mediation in the disclosure process {{that leads to the}} release of an Open Briefing (OB) through CAP. An OB is an interview between senior executives of the firm and an Open Briefing analyst employed by Orient Capital Pty Ltd (broaching topics such as current profit and outlook). Motivated by an absence of research on factors that influence firms to use OBs as a discretionary disclosure channel, this study examines (1) Why do firms choose to release information to the market via OBs?, (2) What are the firm characteristics that explain the discretionary use of OBs as a disclosure channel?, and (3) What are the disclosure attributes that influence firms’ decisions to regularly use OBs as a disclosure channel? Based on agency and information economics theories, a theoretical framework is developed to address research questions. This theoretical framework comprises disclosure environments such as firm characteristics and external factors, disclosure attributes and disclosure consequences. In order to address the first research question, the study investigates (i) the purpose of using OBs, (2) whether firms use <b>OBs</b> to provide <b>information</b> relating to previous public announcements, and (3) whether firms use OBs to provide routine or non-routine disclosures. In relation to the second and third research questions, hypotheses are developed to test factors expected to explain the discretionary use of OBs and firms’ decisions to regularly use OBs, and to explore the factors influencing the nature of OB disclosure. Content analysis and logistic regression models are used to investigate the research questions and test the hypotheses. Data are drawn from a hand-collected population of 1863 OB announcements issued by 239 listed firms between 2000 and 2010. The results show that types of information disclosed via an OB announcement are principally on matters relating to corporate strategies and performance and outlook. Most OB announcements are linked with a previous related announcement, with the lag between announcements significantly longer for loss-making firms than profitmaking firms. The main results show that firms which tend to be larger, have an analyst following, and have higher growth opportunities, are more likely to release OBs. Further, older firms and firms that release OB announcements containing good news, historical information and less complex information tend to be regular OB users. Lastly, firms more likely to disclose strategic <b>information</b> via <b>OBs</b> tend to operate in industries facing greater uncertainty, do not have analysts following, and have higher growth opportunities are less likely to disclose good news, historical information and complex <b>information</b> via <b>OBs.</b> This study is expected to contribute to disclosure literature in terms of disclosure attributes and firm characteristics that influence behaviour in this unique (OB) disclosure channel. With regard to practical significance, regulators can gain an understanding of how OBs are disclosed which can assist them in monitoring the use of OBs and improving the effectiveness of communications with stakeholders. In addition, investors can have a better comprehension of <b>information</b> contained in <b>OB</b> announcements, which may in turn better facilitate their investment decisions...|$|R
40|$|Sentiment Analysis (SA) is {{the study}} of {{opinions}} and emotions that are conveyed by text. This field of study has commercial applications for example in market research (e. g., “What do customers like and dislike about a product?”) and consumer behavior (e. g., “Which book will a customer buy next when he wrote a positive review about book X?”). A private person can benefit from SA by automatic movie or restaurant recommendations, or from applications on the computer or smart phone that adapt to the user’s current mood. In this thesis we will put forward research on artificial Neural Network (NN) methods applied to SA. Many challenges arise, such as sarcasm, domain dependency, and data scarcity, {{that need to be addressed}} by a successful system. In the first part of this thesis we perform linguistic analysis of a word (“hard”) under the light of SA. We show that sentiment-specific word sense disambiguation is necessary to distinguish fine nuances of polarity. Commonly available resources are not sufficient for this. The introduced Contextually Enhanced Sentiment Lexicon (CESL) is used to label occurrences of “hard” in a real dataset with its sense. That allows us to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with deep learning features that predicts the polarity of a single occurrence of the word, just given its context words. We show that the features we propose improve the result compared to existing standard features. Since the labeling effort is not negligible, we propose a clustering approach that reduces the manual effort to a minimum. The deep learning features that help predicting fine-grained, context-dependent polarity are computed by a Neural Network Language Model (NNLM), namely a variant of the Log-Bilinear Language model (LBL). By improving this model the performance of polarity classification might as well improve. Thus, we propose a non-linear version of the LBL and the vectorized Log-Bilinear Language model (vLBL), because non-linear models are generally considered more powerful. In a parameter study on a language modeling task, we show that the non-linear versions indeed perform better than their linear counterparts. However, the difference is small, except for settings where the model has only few parameters, which might be the case when little training data is available and the model therefore needs to be smaller in order to avoid overfitting. An alternative approach to fine-grained polarity classification as used above is to train classifiers that will do the distinction automatically. Due to the complexity of the task, the challenges of SA in general, and certain domain-specific issues (e. g., when using Twitter text) existing systems have much room to improve. Often statistical classifiers are used with simple Bag-of-Words (BOW) features or count features that stem from sentiment lexicons. We introduce a linguistically-informed Convolutional Neural Network (lingCNN) that builds upon the fact that there has been much research on language in general and sentiment lexicons in particular. lingCNN makes use of two types of linguistic features: word-based and sentence-based. Word-based features comprise features derived from sentiment lexicons, such as polarity or valence and general knowledge about language, such as a negation-based feature. Sentence-based features are also based on lexicon counts and valences. The combination of both types of features is superior to the original model without these features. Especially, when little training data is available (that can be the case for different languages that are underresourced), lingCNN proves to be significantly better (up to 12 macro-F 1 points). Although, linguistic features in terms of sentiment lexicons are beneficial, their usage gives rise to a new set of problems. Most lexicons consist of infinitive forms of words only. Especially, lexicons for low-resource languages. However, the text that needs to be classified is unnormalized. Hence, we want to answer the question if morphological information is necessary for SA or if a system that neglects all this information and therefore can make better use of lexicons actually has an advantage. Our approach is to first stem or lemmatize a dataset and then perform polarity classification on it. On Czech and English datasets we show that better results can be achieved with normalization. As a positive side effect, we can compute better word embeddings by first normalizing the training corpus. This works especially well for languages that have rich morphology. We show on word similarity datasets for English, German, and Spanish that our embeddings improve performance. On a new WordNet-based evaluation we confirm these results on five different languages (Czech, English, German, Hungarian, and Spanish). The benefit of this new evaluation is further that it can be used for many other languages, as the only resource that is required is a WordNet. In the last part of the thesis, we use a recently introduced method to create an ultradense sentiment space out of generic word embeddings. This method allows us to compress 400 dimensional word embeddings down to 40 or even just 4 dimensions and still get similar results on a polarity classification task. While the training speed increases by a factor of 44, the difference in classification performance is not significant. Sentiment Analyse (SA) ist das Untersuchen von Meinungen und Emotionen die durch Text übermittelt werden. Dieses Forschungsgebiet findet kommerzielle Anwendungen in Marktforschung (z. B. : „Was mögen Kunden an einem Produkt (nicht) ?“) und Konsumentenverhalten (z. B. : „Welches Buch wird ein Kunde als nächstes kaufen, nachdem er eine positive Rezension über Buch X geschrieben hat?“). Aber auch als Privatperson kann man von Forschung in SA profitieren. Beispiele hierfür sind automatisch erstellte Film- oder Restaurantempfehlungen oder Anwendungen auf Computer oder Smartphone die sich der aktuellen Stimmungslage des Benutzers anpassen. In dieser Arbeit werden wir Forschung auf dem Gebiet der Neuronen Netze (NN) angewendet auf SA vorantreiben. Dabei ergeben sich viele Herausforderungen, wie Sarkasmus, Domänenabhängigkeit und Datenarmut, die ein erfolgreiches System angehen muss. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit führen wir eine linguistische Analyse des englischen Wortes „hard“ in Hinblick auf SA durch. Wir zeigen, dass sentiment-spezifische Wortbedeutungsdisambiguierung notwendig ist, um feine Nuancen von Polarität (positive vs. negative Stimmung) unterscheiden zu können. Häufig verwendete, frei verfügbare Ressourcen sind dafür nicht ausreichend. Daher stellen wir CESL (Contextually Enhanced Sentiment Lexicon), ein sentiment-spezifisches Bedeutungslexicon vor, welches verwendet wird, um Vorkommen von „hard“ in einem realen Datensatz mit seinen Bedeutungen zu versehen. Das Lexikon erlaubt es eine Support Vector Machine (SVM) mit Features aus dem Deep Learning zu trainieren, die in der Lage ist, die Polarität eines Vorkommens nur anhand seiner Kontextwörter vorherzusagen. Wir zeigen, dass die vorgestellten Features die Ergebnisse der SVM verglichen mit Standard-Features verbessern. Da der Aufwand für das Erstellen von markierten Trainingsdaten nicht zu unterschätzen ist, stellen wir einen Clustering-Ansatz vor, der den manuellen Markierungsaufwand auf ein Minimum reduziert. Die Deep Learning Features, die die Vorhersage von feingranularer, kontextabhängiger Polarität verbessern, werden mittels eines neuronalen Sprachmodells, genauer eines Log-Bilinear Language model (LBL) s, berechnet. Wenn man dieses Modell verbessert, wird vermutlich auch das Ergebnis der Polaritätsklassifikation verbessert. Daher führen wir nichtlineare Versionen des LBL und vectorized Log-Bilinear Language model (vLBL) ein, weil nichtlineare Modelle generell als mächtiger angesehen werden. In einer Parameterstudie zur Sprachmodellierung zeigen wir, dass nichtlineare Modelle tatsächlich besser abschneiden, als ihre linearen Gegenstücke. Allerdings ist der Unterschied gering, es sei denn die Modelle können nur auf wenige Parameter zurückgreifen. So etwas kommt zum Beispiel vor, wenn nur wenige Trainingsdaten verfügbar sind und das Modell deshalb kleiner sein muss, um Überanpassung zu verhindern. Ein alternativer Ansatz zur feingranularen Polaritätsklassifikation wie oben verwendet, ist es, einen Klassifikator zu trainieren, der die Unterscheidung automatisch vornimmt. Durch die Komplexität der Aufgabe, der Herausforderungen von SA im Allgemeinen und speziellen domänenspezifischen Problemen (z. B. : wenn Twitter-Daten verwendet werden) haben existierende Systeme noch immer großes Optimierungspotential. Oftmals verwenden statistische Klassifikatoren einfache Bag-of-Words (BOW) -Features. Alternativ kommen Zähl-Features zum Einsatz, die auf Sentiment-Lexika aufsetzen. Wir stellen linguistically-informed Convolutional Neural Network (lingCNN) vor, dass auf dem Fakt beruht, dass bereits viel Forschung in Sprachen und Sentiment-Lexika geflossen ist. lingCNN macht von zwei linguistischen Feature-Typen Gebrauch: wortbasierte und satzbasierte. Wort-basierte Features umfassen Features die von Sentiment-Lexika, wie Polarität oder Valenz (die Stärke der Polarität) und generellem Wissen über Sprache, z. B. : Verneinung, herrühren. Satzbasierte Features basieren ebenfalls auf Zähl-Features von Lexika und auf Valenzen. Die Kombination beider Feature-Typen ist dem Originalmodell ohne linguistische Features überlegen. Besonders wenn wenige Trainingsdatensätze vorhanden sind (das kann der Fall für Sprachen sein, die weniger erforscht sind als englisch). lingCNN schneidet signifikant besser ab (bis zu 12 macro-F 1 Punkte). Obwohl linguistische Features basierend auf Sentiment-Lexika vorteilhaft sind, führt deren Verwendung zu neuen Problemen. Der Großteil der Lexika enthält nur Infinitivformen der Wörter. Dies gilt insbesondere für Sprachen mit wenigen Ressourcen. Das ist eine Herausforderung, weil der Text der klassifiziert werden soll in der Regel nicht normalisiert ist. Daher wollen wir die Frage beantworten, <b>ob</b> morphologische <b>Information</b> für SA überhaupt notwendig ist oder ob ein System, dass jegliche morphologische Information ignoriert und dadurch bessere Verwendung der Lexika erzielt, einen Vorteil genießt. Unser Ansatz besteht aus Stemming und Lemmatisierung des Datensatzes, bevor dann die Polaritätsklassifikation durchgeführt wird. Auf englischen und tschechischen Daten zeigen wir, dass durch Normalisierung bessere Ergebnisse erzielt werden. Als positiven Nebeneffekt kann man bessere Wortrepresentationen (engl. word embeddings) berechnen, indem das Trainingskorpus zuerst normalisiert wird. Das funktioniert besonders gut für morphologisch reiche Sprachen. Wir zeigen auf Datensätzen zur Wortähnlichkeit für deutsch, englisch und spanisch, dass unsere Wortrepresentationen die Ergebnisse verbessern. In einer neuen WordNet-basierten Evaluation bestätigen wir diese Ergebnisse für fünf verschiedene Sprachen (deutsch, englisch, spanisch, tschechisch und ungarisch). Der Vorteil dieser Evaluation ist weiterhin, dass sie für viele Sprachen angewendet werden kann, weil sie lediglich ein WordNet als Ressource benötigt. Im letzten Teil der Arbeit verwenden wir eine kürzlich vorgestellte Methode zur Erstellen eines ultradichten Sentiment-Raumes aus generischen Wortrepresentationen. Diese Methode erlaubt es uns 400 dimensionale Wortrepresentationen auf 40 oder sogar nur 4 Dimensionen zu komprimieren und weiterhin die gleichen Resultate in Polaritätsklassifikation zu erhalten. Während die Trainingsgeschwindigkeit um einen Faktor von 44 verbessert wird, sind die Unterschiede in der Polaritätsklassifikation nicht signifikant...|$|R
