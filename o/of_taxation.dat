5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> become more effective and efficient, and the rate <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> {{lifetime income}} {{with and without}} an emigration option during old age. The government sets the rates <b>of</b> deferred <b>taxation</b> and <b>of</b> possibly reduced <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> interest. If agents are immobile, the optimal policy consists in full deferral of income taxes on savings and a full <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> interest. Mobility of the old calls for lower degrees of deferral and reduced <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> interest. However, the optimum never entails full immediate <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> savings in combination with full tax exemption on capital income. deferred taxation, income tax, savings, migration...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{discrete}} model <b>of</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> married couples and empirically discuss the optimality <b>of</b> income <b>taxation</b> for this group. To this end, we derive the social welfare function which guarantees that joint <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> married couples is optimal. We will contrast this welfare function {{with the one}} that makes a system <b>of</b> individual <b>taxation</b> optimal. For the empirical application we use a static structural labor supply model to estimate the preferences of households. We find that the system <b>of</b> joint <b>taxation</b> is only optimal when {{the government has a}} high taste for redistribution towards one-earner couples and a very low or even negative taste for redistribution towards couples in which both partners earn a similar amount of income. In contrast, the optimality <b>of</b> individual <b>taxation</b> is less dependent of the working composition within the household. joint <b>taxation,</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> married couples, labor supply estimation...|$|R

5|$|Additionally {{in early}} May, Charles assented to an {{unprecedented}} Act that forbade {{the dissolution of the}} English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and full control <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|During Charles' illness, Orléans became financially {{powerful}} {{as the official}} tax collector, and in the following decade Isabeau and Orléans agreed to raise the level <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> In 1401, {{during one of the}} King's absences, Orléans installed his own men to collect royal revenues, angering Philip the Bold who in retaliation raised an army, threatening to enter Paris with 600 men-at-arms and 60 knights. At that time Isabeau intervened between Orléans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak of civil war.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} a new form <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> called the poll tax, which was levied {{at the rate of}} four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Having been proclaimed emperor {{solely on}} the {{initiative}} of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace.

The first level deals with the multiple ways to tax capital (income or value, proportional or progressive taxation, and the temporality <b>of</b> the <b>taxation)</b> and presents some of France's particular features within a heterogeneous European context. The second area of investigation focuses on the main dynamic properties generated by capital taxation: the principle of equivalence with a tax on consumption; the issue <b>of</b> double <b>taxation</b> if it targets <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> nominal income; neutrality of the uniform tax on the capital value; lastly, the risk <b>of</b> confiscatory <b>taxation</b> {{if there is a}} disjunction between <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> the value and the income.
