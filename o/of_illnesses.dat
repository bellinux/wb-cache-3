40|$|Background: The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) {{survey is}} used by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to assess {{inpatient}} satisfaction. HCAHPS survey results are publicly reported, and performance began to affect CMS reimbursement to hospitals as of FY 2013. However, the impact <b>of</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> on patients' self-reported inpatient satisfaction as measured by HCAHPS survey scores remains unknown. Objective: To determine the impact <b>of</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> on patients' self-reported inpatient satisfaction. Design: The All Patient-Refined, Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG) classifies every patient into one of four levels <b>of</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> We evaluated the impact of APR-DRG severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> on five HCAHPS domains, two reputation and two environmental questions, using linear regression analysis. Setting: Adult inpatients discharged from a large, academic, tertiary care hospital Patients: 37, 223 patients' HCAHPS survey data were combined with their APR-DRG severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> rating over a 39 -month period between April 2008 and June 2011. Measurements: HCAHPS scores Results: Higher severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> was consistently and inversely associated with lower patients' self-reported perception of inpatient hospital satisfaction as measured by HCAHPS scores. For each one-unit increase in severity <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> the average HCHAPS scores across all five domains were approximately 3 percent lower. Conclusions: Hospitals treating patients with a higher severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> will have lower HCAHPS scores, potentially leading these hospitals to receive lower reimbursement from CMS. Conversely, hospitals with lower severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> will receive greater reimbursement. Failure to adequately adjust for severity <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> is a serious flaw in the current HCAHPS reporting system that should be corrected...|$|R

5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession <b>of</b> <b>illnesses.</b> He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>illnesses</b> in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} As other tumors, unresectabe lung cancer can cause many psychological problems to the patients, {{such as depression}} and anxiety. The present paper aims to evaluate the status of depression before and after knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> in patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} of stage Ⅲ. Methods 43 casesof newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stage Ⅲ were enrolled in the study. All the patients were distributed into three groups and given different intervention, that was completely unknowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> (group A), partly knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> (group B) and completely knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> (group C). Before and after knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> the depression status was assessed with the Hamilton depression rating scale for depression(HAMD). Results The mean total score of HAMD was unchanged both in group A and C, while significantly reduced in group B. The scores of anxiety somatization, cognitive disorder, retardation and feeling of despair were all significant lower in the group B after the patients partly knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> while the scores of sleep disorder was obviously higher in group C after the patients completely knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> The hypochondriasis was much severer in the group A, and in the group C, the score of suicidal idea became significantly higher after the patient knowing the diagnosis. Conclusion Depression is very common in the NSCLC patients with stage Ⅲ. Partly knowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> can obviously ameliorate the symptoms of depression, while completely knowing or completely unknowing the state <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> have no effect on relieving the patients' depression...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} the conceptual metaphor <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> in representations <b>of</b> financial crises. Understanding the economy {{in terms of the}} body is one of the dominant concepts in contemporary media coverage on economic events. Accordingly, images <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> proliferate in the discourse on the financial crisis of 2008 / 2009. This paper presents a quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> metaphors in 53 articles on the financial crisis published from August 2008 to September 2009 in the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel. The journalistic metaphors <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> interpret the financial crisis as a disease and thus naturalize the economic events. The second part of the article analyzes an alternative use <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> metaphors in literary and autobiographical texts on traders. Instead of understanding the economy as a victim <b>of</b> an <b>illness,</b> these texts ascribe an infectious quality to the economic system. In these representations the financial economy is criticized for causing diseases not only of its participants, but of the society in general...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} meaning and {{experience}} of the bodily states associated with the condition referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). It uses as a theoretical point of departure {{an understanding of the}} body as a socially constructed phenomenon and, in so dOing, offers an interpretation <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> that is seen to differ markedly from those offered by the medical and behavioural sciences. Using descriptive narrative research analysis, the thesis attempts to elicit personal trajectories <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> experience. In contrast to biomedical and social trajectories <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> in which the interpretation and meaning given to the condition are imposed externally, personal trajectories are seen to provide unique subjective accounts <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> experience. And the value of using narrative accounts <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> is seen to lie in their ability to bring to light these individualised versions <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> experience. It is shown, in addition, that these narrative accounts <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> are also valuable in exposing the culturally shared knowledge that is employed in the process of assigning meaning to illness experiences. The aim of the thesis, then, in employing the descriptive narrative research method is to describe these shared cultural schemas. It is suggested that this approach leads to an interpretation <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> experience which sheds light on important links between the body, self and society. It is argued, more specifically, that Western capitalist society is associated with the creation of an "unnatural" environment and social context which is perceived to be inherently damaging and threatening to the well·being of those living in it; and that this assumption is pivotal to the interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>illness</b> experiences narrated and analysed for the thesis. This sociological reading of embodiment provides a basis for understanding the experience <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> as not one simply embedded in the body or mind of the individual, but as one laden with personal meaning assimilated from, and hence revealing of, the social context in which the illness is experienced. As such, an attempt is made to provide an account <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> experience distinct from the dominant biomedical and behavioural accounts of ME...|$|R
