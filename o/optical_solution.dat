40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an <b>optical</b> <b>solution</b> to (bounded-length input instances of) an NP-complete problem {{called the}} traveling salesman problem using a pure optical system. The solution {{is based on}} the multiplication of a binary-matrix, representing all feasible routes, by a weight-vector, representing the weights of the problem. The multiplication of the binary-matrix by the weight-vector can be implemented by any optical vector-matrix multiplier. In this paper, we show that this multiplication can be obtained by an optical correlator. In order to synthesize the binary-matrix, a unique iterative algorithm is presented. This algorithm synthesizes an N-node binary-matrix using rather small number of vector duplications from the (N− 1) -node binary-matrix. We also show that the algorithm itself can be implemented optically and thus we ensure the entire <b>optical</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem. Simulation and experimental results prove the validity of the optical method...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{inscription}} of chirped fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) with a phase mask and a deformed wavefront using a femtosecond laser. A qualitative model is developed to predict {{the behavior of the}} resulting grating period for a deformed wavefront. In addition the quantitative change of the period was simulated based on a ray <b>optical</b> <b>solution</b> of the diffraction behind the phase mask. For deforming the wavefront experimentally a cylindrical tuning lens was used. Tilting of the lens increased the higher order aberrations like coma and spherical aberration, which leads to chirped FBGs. A chirped FBG with a FWHM bandwidth of 2. 5 nm could be realized. The change of the resulting fiber Bragg grating period was measured using a side diffraction setup yielding good agreement with the measured spectra...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an interactive}} method to assess cataracts in the hu-man eye by crafting an <b>optical</b> <b>solution</b> that measures the percep-tual impact of forward scattering on the foveal region. Current so-lutions rely on highly-trained clinicians {{to check the}} back scattering in the crystallin lens and test their predictions on visual acuity tests. Close-range parallax barriers create collimated beams of light to scan through sub-apertures, scattering light as it strikes a cataract. User feedback generates maps for opacity, attenuation, contrast and sub-aperture point-spread functions. The goal is to allow a gen-eral audience to operate a portable high-contrast light-field display to gain a meaningful understanding of their own visual conditions. User evaluations and validation with modified camera optics are performed. Compiled data is used to reconstruct the individual’s cataract-affected view, offering a novel approach for capturing in-formation for screening, diagnostic, and clinical analysis...|$|E

40|$|Data Center Networking (DCNs) is a fast {{emerging}} {{enterprise application}} that is driving metropolitan bandwidth needs. This paper evaluates {{the needs of}} this emerging IT-centric, bandwidth voluminous and service rendering application from a metro optical networking perspective. We identify a set of needs called CAVALIER (Consolidation, Automation, Virtualization, Adaptability, Latency, Integration, Economy and Reliability) that are underlying requirements for a network to support DCN services. The CAVALIER requirements are met by proposing a metro <b>optical</b> <b>solution</b> {{which is based on}} light-trail ROADM technology. Light-trails exhibit properties such as dynamic bandwidth provisioning, optical multicasting, sub-wavelength granular support and low-cost for deployment. Adapting light-trails to DCN needs is discussed in this paper through engineering requirements and network-wide design. Each aspect of the CAVALIER requirement is then mapped on to light-trail technology. Simulation results are shown to lead to performance betterments. © IEE...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{cooperative}} m-person discounted Markov {{game with}} a continuous time and a metric state space is investigated. An optimization problem in the m-person game {{is to find a}} Pareto solution determined by the positive orthant in the m-dimentional Euclid space. But, in general, the set of Pareto solutions may be rather large. This is quite a drawback for a solution concept. In this paper, introducing the norm from the multiloss to the shadow minimum as a collective loss function, we consider the minimization norm problem. In general, it seems difficult to find directly a Pareto solution for the norm problem. So, we transfer the primal problem to a dual problem and would find an optimal solution in the dual problem which is called a weak <b>optical</b> <b>solution.</b> Moreover, when a Pareto solution in the primal problem exists, we give a relation between the Pareto solution and a weak optimal solution...|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{optimizing}} ion optical {{systems is}} often a complex and difficult task, which {{requires the use of}} computational tools to iterate and converge towards the desired characteristics and performances of the system. Very often these tools are not well adapted for exploring the numerous degrees of freedom, rendering the process long and tedious, as well as somewhat random due to the very large number of local minima typically found when looking for a particular <b>optical</b> <b>solution.</b> This paper presents a novel approach to finding the desired solution of an optical system, by providing the user with an instant feedback of the effects of changing parameters. The process of finding an approximate solution by manually adjusting parameters is greatly facilitated, at which point the final tune can be calculated by minimization according to a number of constraints.
