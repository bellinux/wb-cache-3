5|$|Against their first-ever {{opponent}} from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Alabama, Sewanee {{shut out}} the Crimson White 20–0 at Lakeview Park. The Tigers took a 4–0 lead in the 22nd minute {{of the first half}} when Wilson scored on a short touchdown run. Early in the second half, Sewanee extended their lead to 8–0 when Norman scored on a 25-yard touchdown run behind the flying wedge formation. Nelson then scored the final two Tiger touchdowns on runs of 45 and one-yard for the 20–0 victory. Sewanee later became one of Alabama's biggest rivals {{in the early decades of}} the football program.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E

Other series reprinted <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> include Nancy Drew, The Dana Girls, The Hardy Boys and the Bobbsey Twins(Australia, France, Norway, Sweden, UK).

5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E

5|$|By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was {{producing}} useful technology, and the station needed {{a method to}} conduct contract work <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. The IDC was created as a non-profit contract organization for the EES, which allowed the EES to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with Georgia Tech and the State of Georgia. It {{was created by the}} Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the Engineering Experiment Station's director {{was a member of the}} council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments. In addition, the contract organization manages the intellectual property that results from research.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the {{statement}} that U.S. patent law is without extraterritorial application occurs universally in cases holding that liability for patent infringement under U.S. law should not be based on acts and conduct occurring <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States.</b> And even that generality is suspect, for sometimes patent infringement liability in <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> is based on conduct <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States.</b> Applying exhaustion on an international basis does not regulate acts and conduct performed <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United States; it defines infringement remedies against importation into and sale in <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> on <b>the</b> basis of acts and conduct performed <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States.</b>|$|R

During their term, the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government. The powers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are enumerated. Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed.|$|E

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.|$|E
