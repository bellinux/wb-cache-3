5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a <b>one-armed</b> psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual <b>one-armed</b> actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Cole (David Lynch) calls Cooper at the sheriff's station, {{offering}} {{insight into}} Laura's autopsy. Brennan brings in his sketch, which Cooper identifies {{as the man}} from his dream. He also receives a call from Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), who has located the <b>one-armed</b> man they believe is somehow involved; the group find him at a motel. The man, Philip Michael Gerard (Al Strobel) is a traveling salesman, who denies any involvement or that he knows BOB.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{gets into}} a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, while {{defending}} Lisa and the cupcakes that she baked for Miss. Hoover's birthday party. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same treatment the following day. At home, Marge consoles and encourages Bart to reason with Nelson. Homer urges Bart to bend the rules and fight dirty. Taking Homer's advice, Bart does so, but is beaten up again. Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson, who introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed <b>one-armed</b> proprietor of an army surplus store. He instructs Bart on military tactics, then Bart declares war on Nelson and his sidekicks.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a <b>one-armed</b> protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E

25|$|In {{the face}} of an {{industry}} downturn in the '90s, he produced two expensive movies. Green Snake (1993) was a poetic and lyric movie based on a favorite Chinese fairy tale. The Blade (1995) was a gory, deliberately rough-hewn revision of the 1967 wuxia classic The <b>One-Armed</b> Swordsman.|$|E
25|$|Lake Powell {{was created}} by the {{flooding}} of Glen Canyon by the Glen Canyon Dam, which also {{led to the creation of}} Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination.

25|$|The 100-year-old Tunde ke Kabab in Chowk is {{the most}} famous outlet for Kababs even today. Tunde kabab is so named {{because it was the}} {{speciality}} of a <b>one-armed</b> chef. The tunde kabab claims to be unique because of the zealously guarded family secret recipe for the masala (homemade spices), prepared by women in the family. It is said to incorporate 160 spices.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Bermuda {{hosted the}} 25th PGA Grand Slam of Golf. This 36-hole event {{was held on}} 16–17 October 2007, at the Mid Ocean Club in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: {{the winners of the}} Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship. The event {{returned}} to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

25|$|Among Vilanch's {{duties as}} Oscar writer {{have been coming}} up with {{additional}} jokes for the host based on unexpected events that have occurred during the telecast. Most memorably, at the 1992 ceremony {{he came up with}} a series of one-liners that host Billy Crystal told throughout the night after 73-year-old Jack Palance (Crystal's City Slickers co-star) did <b>one-armed</b> push-ups during his Best Supporting Actor acceptance speech.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{during the}} opening of the Oscars, a spoof of that Oscar {{highlight}} featured Palance appearing to drag in an enormous Academy Award statuette with Crystal again hosting, riding on the rear end of it. Halfway across the stage, Palance dropped to the ground as if exhausted, but then performed several <b>one-armed</b> push-ups before regaining his feet and dragging the giant Oscar {{the rest of the way}} across the stage.|$|E
25|$|Cooper has a {{dream in}} which he is {{approached}} by a <b>one-armed</b> otherworldly being who calls himself Mike. Mike says that Laura's murderer is a similar entity, Killer Bob, a feral, denim-clad man with long gray hair. Cooper finds himself decades older with Laura and a dwarf in a red business suit, who engages in coded dialogue with Cooper. The next morning, Cooper tells Truman that, if he can decipher the dream, he will know who killed Laura.|$|E
25|$|Cooper and the sheriff's {{department}} {{find the}} <b>one-armed</b> man from Cooper's dream, a traveling shoe salesman named Phillip Gerard. Gerard knows a Bob, the veterinarian who treats Renault's pet bird. Cooper interprets these events {{to mean that}} Renault is the murderer and, with Truman's help, tracks Renault to One-Eyed Jack's, a brothel owned by Horne {{across the border in}} Canada. He lures Renault back onto U.S. soil to arrest him, but Renault tries to escape and is shot and hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Davis {{travelled}} to Australia {{to compete}} in the World Championship, where he played Dennis Taylor in an ordinary club billiard room in which a large number of <b>one-armed</b> bandits were in constant use. Hampered by such conditions, an unhappy Davis lost by a single frame, 15–14. The 1975 Watney Open in Leeds provided some consolation, and Davis beat Patsy Fagan 13–9 and John Spencer 13–12 before losing 17–11 in the final to Alex Higgins. Davis stated that a win over Spencer convinced him that he could still compete at the highest level of tournament play.|$|E
25|$|The next evening, Laura {{goes to the}} Roadhouse to {{meet her}} drug {{connections}} and have sex with strange men. Unexpectedly, Donna shows up. They all go to the Pink Room. Laura discusses Teresa Banks's murder with Ronette Pulaski, and Ronette says that Teresa was trying to blackmail someone. When she sees a topless Donna making out with a stranger, a distraught Laura takes her home and begs Donna not to become like her. The next morning, Philip Gerard, the <b>one-armed</b> man possessed by the repentant demon MIKE, {{in an attempt to}} warn Laura about her father and Bob, pulls up alongside Leland's car and shows Teresa's ring to Laura.|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{of slaves}} found freedom by fleeing from their masters, forming {{communities}} of maroons and raiding isolated plantations. The most famous was Mackandal, a <b>one-armed</b> slave, originally from Guinea, who escaped in 1751. A Vodou Houngan (priest), he united {{many of the}} different maroon bands. He spent {{the next six years}} staging successful raids and evading capture by the French, reputedly killing over 6,000 people, while preaching a fanatic vision of the destruction of white civilization in St. Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Français.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} of the Phoolbagan and Maniktala Police Stations of Calcutta were nearly successful in recapturing Sajal Barui in early 2003, after {{they were able to}} trace his girlfriend and set up a sting operation to recapture him. However, Sajal Barui did not show up for the arranged rendezvous. Sajal Barui then took refuge in the den of a local criminal known as Hathkata Bishu (Bengali for <b>one-armed</b> Bishu) in Lake Town, Kolkata. He worked with Bishu, under the alias Kamal, and was responsible for a robbery in the Ultadanga area of Kolkata. As the search for Kamal intensified, Sajal Barui, migrated to Jamboni, in West Midnapore district, to work for Rajeev Meti, a local criminal.|$|E
25|$|Though he had {{a record}} of 6–8, pitcher Les Mueller {{appeared}} in 26 games and {{played an important role}} in the 1945 Tigers season. After missing the 1942–1944 seasons to military service, Mueller gave up a single to Pete Gray, the St. Louis Browns' famous <b>one-armed</b> outfielder, in Gray's first major league game in April 1945. Three months later, on July 21, 1945, Mueller pitched the first 19⅔ innings for the Tigers and left having given up only 1 run. No pitcher has thrown as many innings in a major league game since Mueller's feat. The game lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes before the game was called due to darkness. Mueller also pitched 2 scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1945 World Series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match, AJ Styles faced Shane McMahon. During the match, Styles {{attempted}} a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on Styles, who then countered into a <b>one-armed</b> Styles Clash on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, Styles attempted a Coast-to-Coast on Shane, who countered by attacking Styles with {{a trash can}}. Shane then performed a Coast-to-Coast into a trash can on Styles for a near-fall. Shane attempted a Leap of Faith through an announce table on Styles, only for Styles {{to move out of}} the way and Shane fell through the announce table. As Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane, Shane countered into a float-over DDT on Styles. Shane attempted a shooting star press on Styles, who avoided the move and performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Emerson's Concord home {{caught fire}} on July 24, 1872. He called {{for help from}} neighbors and, giving up on putting out the flames, all {{attempted}} to save as many objects as possible. The fire was put out by Ephraim Bull Jr., the <b>one-armed</b> son of Ephraim Wales Bull. Donations were collected by friends to help the Emersons rebuild, including $5,000 gathered by Francis Cabot Lowell, another $10,000 collected by LeBaron Russell Briggs, and a personal donation of $1,000 from George Bancroft. Support for shelter was offered as well; though the Emersons ended up staying with family at the Old Manse, invitations came from Anne Lynch Botta, James Elliot Cabot, James Thomas Fields and Annie Adams Fields. The fire marked an end to Emerson's serious lecturing career; from then on, he would lecture only on special occasions and only in front of familiar audiences.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, he had {{the idea}} of {{establishing}} a Jewish Legion to fight alongside the British against the Ottomans who then controlled Palestine. In 1915, together with Joseph Trumpeldor, a <b>one-armed</b> veteran of the Russo-Japanese War, he created the Zion Mule Corps, which consisted of several hundred Jewish men, mainly Russians who had been exiled from Palestine by the Ottoman Empire and had settled in Egypt. The unit served with distinction in the Battle of Gallipoli. When the Zion Mule Corps was disbanded, Jabotinsky traveled to London, where he continued his efforts to establish Jewish units to fight in Palestine {{as part of the}} British Army. Although Jabotinsky did not serve with the Zion Mule Corps, Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky and 120 Zion Mule Corps members did serve in Platoon 16 of the 20th Battalion of the London Regiment. In 1917, the government agreed to establish three Jewish battalions, initiating the Jewish Legion.|$|E

500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a <b>one-armed</b> character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers {{nothing out of the ordinary}} other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the second}} season, Mae Whitman plays Ann Veal, George Michael's sternly Christian girlfriend, often {{forgotten}} or disparaged by Michael. Ann was first played by Alessandra Torresani, and {{first appeared in the}} season 1 episode [...] "Let 'Em Eat Cake". Gob's girlfriend Marta Estrella, who eventually reciprocates Michael's infatuation with her and ends up causing conflict between the two brothers, was originally played by Leonor Varela and later by Patricia Velasquez. J. Walter Weatherman (Steve Ryan), a <b>one-armed</b> amputee, is an old employee of George Sr.; Weatherman appears in flashbacks in several episodes where, as hired by George Sr., he would teach the Bluth children lessons by participating in staged accidents where he would [...] "lose" [...] his (prosthetic) arm.|$|E

Sigurður says that the elf's penis, which the museum's catalogue describes as [...] "unusually big and old", is among his favourites. It cannot be seen, as Icelandic folklore holds that elves and trolls are invisible. The folkloric penises also include those of a merman, a one-legged, <b>one-armed</b> and one-eyed monster called a Beach-Murmurer, an Enriching Beach Mouse (said to draw [...] "money from the sea to enrich her owner"), and an Icelandic Christmas Lad found dead {{at the foot of}} a mountain in 1985 and whose penis was presented to the museum by a former mayor of Reykjavík.|$|E
500|$|Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum cited The Seventh Victim as his {{favorite}} horror film; {{it is the}} only horror movie on his list of 100 favorite movies. Film historian Carlos Clarens also praised the film, noting: [...] "Rarely has a film succeeded so well in capturing the nocturnal menace of a large city, the terror underneath the everyday, the suggestion of hidden evil," [...] and deemed it [...] "hauntingly oppressive." [...] In Guide for the Film Fanatic, critic Danny Peary wrote that The Seventh Victim is [...] "a complete original, a cult film in England way back in the forties. It features bizarre and sinister characters (i.e. a <b>one-armed</b> female devil-worshipper who plays piano), smart, strong-willed women, and several scary scenes... The double suicide [...] that ends the film is perhaps the most baffling, depressing moment in all horror films." ...|$|E
500|$|Dale Cooper {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from Hawk (Michael Horse) about a <b>one-armed</b> man seen at Ronette Pulaski's hospital bed. The next morning, Cooper gathers together Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputies Hawk and Brennan (Harry Goaz), and Lucy Moran (Kimmy Robertson) in a forest clearing to demonstrate his unusual approach to eliminating suspects from their investigation. As each suspect's name is read from a list, Cooper throws a stone at a bottle placed [...] away. Each time he hits the bottle with a stone, he considers the previous name read out to be of interest to the case. The method points his suspicion at Leo Johnson and psychiatrist Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn). Dale's fellow FBI agent Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) arrives later, while Truman and Cooper review evidence, and immediately causes friction between himself and Truman.|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a <b>one-armed</b> man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Pirkis {{started his}} acting in school plays while {{attending}} Eton, {{though he never}} took them seriously. Although unsure {{what he wanted to}} do with his life, Pirkis was cast for his first professional role in 2003, when he appeared in the successful film, [...] The hire occurred after production staff visited Eton to hire boys for the ship's teenage crew. Pirkis attended a workshop and auditions as [...] "a joke", ultimately securing the part of the 13-year-old, eventually <b>one-armed</b> midshipman Lord Blakeney of HMS Surprise. Director Peter Weir thought Pirkis [...] "stood out very early on, but not to the extent that you see in the film. That was a complete surprise." [...] According to Pirkis, he was at first [...] "nervous" [...] about acting with Russell Crowe, but changed his mind when he realised that Crowe was [...] "a pretty normal guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after being}} cast in Master and Commander, Pirkis was {{contracted}} {{to be represented}} by Hollywood talent agency ICM. The income he earned for the film was placed into a bank, making him wait until he turned eighteen. For his role, Pirkis received critical acclaim and won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer and the Young Artist Award for Best International Performance by a Young Actor at the 25th Young Artist Awards. Pirkis was also nominated for Best Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role– Male at the 4th Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards. Jeremiah Kipp of Slant Magazine praised Pirkis, writing that he [...] "makes a winning impression as midshipman Lord Blakeney, a pugnacious <b>one-armed</b> lad who imitates the masculine bravado of Crowe and the bookish reserve of Bettany." ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} mid-19thcentury, long {{stretches}} of the Colorado and Green rivers between Wyoming and Nevada remained largely unexplored due to their remote location and dangers of navigation. Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, <b>one-armed</b> Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers {{all the way down}} to St. Thomas, Nevada, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado: ...|$|E
500|$|For the live-action spacewalk scenes, visual-effects {{supervisor}} Ronald B. Moore {{spent two}} weeks of bluescreen photography at the deflector set. Frakes regarded filming the scene {{to be the most}} tedious in the film because of the amount of preparation it took for each day's shoot. Since the rest of the Enterprise-E, as well as the backdrop of Earth, were to be added later in post-production, it became confusing to coordinate shots. Moore used a laptop with digital reproductions of the set to orient the crew and help Frakes understand what the finished shot would look like. A <b>one-armed</b> actor portrayed the Borg whose arm Worf slices off to accurately portray the effect intended, and the actors' shoes were fitted with lead weights to remind the actors they were to move slowly as if actually wearing gravity boots. McDonough recalled that he joined Stewart and Dorn in asking whether they could do the shots without the [...] weights, as [...] "they hired us because we are actors", but the production insisted on using them.|$|E
