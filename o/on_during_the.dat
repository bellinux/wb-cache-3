5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|By the 1350s {{the cannon}} was used {{extensively}} in Chinese warfare. In 1358 the Ming army {{failed to take}} a city due to its garrisons' usage of cannon, however they themselves would use cannon in the thousands later <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> siege of Suzhou in 1366.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Mackinnon {{worked in}} {{military}} hospitals in Britain, researching {{and helping to}} diagnose amoebic dysentery. Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic, which she focussed <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College, London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her research work focussed on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years. She also gave broadcast lectures for schools.|$|E
5|$|Gloucestershire {{replied with}} an innings of 279, in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out, while Johnson took 6/68.

Johnson took 5/32 {{to end with}} 11/100 for the match, while Ring took 5/47 to end with seven for the match. Australia's spinners took 19 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Handscroll: The handscroll {{originated}} from ancient Chinese text documents. From the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound {{and used to}} write texts <b>on.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of paper and silk as handscrolls became more common. The handscroll was {{the one of the}} main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a standard form for mounting artwork. New styles were developed over time.|$|E

Giovinco came <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second half, and he helped set up Giorgio Chiellini's second, match-winning goal, also hitting the cross-bar {{towards the end of}} the match, from a strike outside the area, after an individual dribbling run.|$|E
5|$|The basic city plan {{dates from}} 1292, when the port was rebuilt {{following}} a fire. The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, {{except for the}} Dominican monastery, which came under its protection later <b>on,</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Early <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries {{about what happened}} at the 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, as well as the French government. Evra's contract with Manchester United was also {{up at the end of}} the 2011–12 season, which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid. Evra's hearing with the FFF in Paris, which he attended, was held the day after the team's opening 3–0 league win over Newcastle United. Evra played over 85 minutes in the match. On 20 November, Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2–0 win at home against Wigan Athletic. On 21 February 2011, after weeks of negotiations, Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that would keep him with the club until at least the end of the 2013–14 season. Two days after signing his contract extension, Evra participated in United's 0–0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team's first knockout round tie in the Champions League. The match, played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, was Evra's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle. As a consequence, he was subjected to a barrage of jeers and boos every time he touched the ball.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of a {{range of}} animals have been found {{including}} the Pleistocene lion (Felis leo spelæ), Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) and Badger (Meles meles). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Roman era up {{to the end of the}} 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco {{started in}} the first game of Italy's 2014 World Cup Qualification {{campaign}} against Bulgaria in Sofia, wearing the jersey number 10; the match ended in a 2–2 draw. He scored his first goal for Italy in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage match against Japan, wearing the number 10 shirt; in addition to scoring the match-winning goal, he also helped to win a penalty, which was converted by Mario Balotelli, and thus ensured a 4–3 win, which allowed Italy to progress to the semi-finals of the competition {{for the first time in}} their history. In the semi-finals, Giovinco came <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second half of extra time; the match ended 0–0 and went to penalties as Giovinco netted his penalty for Italy, however, Spain won 7–6 due to Leonardo Bonucci's miss. Italy subsequently won the bronze medal match against Uruguay, also on penalties, after the match had ended 2–2 after extra time. Due to the lack of playing time during the 2013–14 season, Giovinco missed out on the 2014 World Cup and was not named in the provisional nor the final squad.|$|E

5|$|In Italy's 3–0 {{second group}} match win over Cameroon, Baggio {{assisted}} Luigi Di Biagio's opening goal. However, he {{was replaced by}} Del Piero {{during the second half}} after sustaining a minor injury. Baggio scored his second goal of the tournament in Italy's final group match against Austria, which ended in a 2–1 win to Italy. Baggio came <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second half, replacing Del Piero, after the crowd had begun to chant his name. He scored the winning goal of the match, after combining with Francesco Moriero and Filippo Inzaghi, as Italy topped their group. With this goal, he tied Paolo Rossi's record for most goals by an Italian player in the World Cup finals, with nine. This was also his 27th and final goal for Italy.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{hard times}} follow, with the Autobots {{becoming}} a corrupt galactic police force. While shutting down an Energon-mining operation, they incite a riot by beating an outspoken miner to death. The riot is extinguished, {{resulting in the}} miners either dead or imprisoned. A surviving miner, Megatron, manages {{to take over a}} prison shuttle and hide it in Kaon, the seediest city on Cybertron. Megatron makes a name for himself in the underground gladiatorial matches, learning to enjoy the kill. He recruits the Seekers, Soundwave, and the future Cassetticons to perform acts of terrorism throughout Cybertron. Megatron rallies a large group of gladiators and proposes for them to unite under the same badge, but they are caught and arrested by Sentinel Prime's police force. However, this is part of Megatron's plan, as Starscream kills the Autobot Senate. Megatron kills Sentinel Prime, and the newly forged Decepticons take over the city-state of Kaon, heralding the beginning of the war. The populace at large is distracted by mass sports race games, with racers like the arrogant but talented Blurr becoming celebrities. Early <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war, both Autobot and Decepticon try to recruit Blurr to their cause, with a young Optimus talking Blurr into saving the life of Zeta Prime from Starscream's assassination squad. A rookie Tracks is saved from the elite Predacons by special ops soldier Jazz. In later years, Tracks passes on the story of the lone Autobot to boost morale in times of crisis.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Nelthorpe {{signed a}} {{professional}} contract with Doncaster on 28 June 2006 and joined Conference National club Kidderminster Harriers on a one-month loan on 10 October. He made his debut {{the same day}} in a 0–0 draw with Oxford United, and he nearly scored for Kidderminster during the first half. He scored his first career goal against Droylsden in the FA Cup, and after Kidderminster decided against extending his loan spell, he returned to Doncaster in November after making six appearances. This {{was followed by a}} loan spell at Northern Premier League Premier Division club Gateshead, after joining in November, where he made 19 appearances and scored eight goals. While at Gateshead he still appeared for Doncaster and he had a run of seven appearances, which started after coming <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 3–2 victory over Crewe Alexandra in the Football League Trophy at the Keepmoat Stadium on 13 February 2007. In the final match of the 2006–07 season on 5 May 2007, Nelthorpe scored his first goal for Doncaster against Northampton Town, which finished as a 2–2 draw. He had a trial with recently relegated League Two club Chesterfield in May 2007, with a view to him joining on loan.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} the Southampton walls were used to mount {{searchlights}} and machineguns <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Second World War; the walls escaped damage, unlike many {{other areas of the}} medieval city. In the post-war period the historic importance of the town walls was recognised and considerable conservation work has been conducted on the walls, including reversing the Victorian alterations to the Arcades. The town walls became seen as an important part of Southampton's tourist industry; health and safety concerns, however, prohibit tourists walking along most of the circuit. God's House tower reopened in 1961 opened as Southampton's Museum of Archaeology. Today the walls are protected as grade I listed buildings and as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar <b>on</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
