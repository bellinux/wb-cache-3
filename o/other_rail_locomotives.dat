50|$|Most {{vehicles}} {{are designed to}} meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Different designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space, fuel economy, emissions control, energy security and endurance. Reduced drag and lower rolling resistance in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for fuel flexibility or drive-train hybridisation. Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as hot hatches and sports-utility vehicles reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of sports car like performance or for <b>other</b> psychological benefit. <b>Rail</b> <b>locomotives</b> require high mass to maintain adhesive traction on the rails, therefore improving the power-to-weight ratio by reducing mass is not necessarily beneficial. However choice of <b>rail</b> <b>locomotive</b> traction system (i.e. AC VFD over DC) can support improved power-to-weight ratio by reducing mass for the same adhesion.|$|R
