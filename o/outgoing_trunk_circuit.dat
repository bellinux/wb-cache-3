50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> for <b>outgoing</b> calls, {{so there are no}} junctor <b>circuits.</b> Since different <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> can be simpler.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit,</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> are {{selected}} by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R

50|$|Before {{being able}} to begin sending the next signal, if any, the <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> needs {{to ensure that it}} is {{receiving}} silence on the backward channel.|$|R
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line insulation tester and an automatic trunk tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> test panel allows voltmeter checks on trunks to distant offices, freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|R
50|$|Message <b>Trunk</b> <b>Circuit</b> or CLCI MSG codes {{provide a}} naming scheme for message <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> These codes {{identify}} individual trunks and trunk groups by number, office class, traffic use, trunk type modifier, signaling, and the originating and terminating office locations.|$|R

5000|$|With a clean FCG test, {{the call}} {{completion}} software told the [...] "A" [...] relay in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to operate, connecting its transmission and test hardware to the switching fabric {{and thus to}} the line. Then, for an <b>outgoing</b> call, the <b>trunk's</b> scan point would scan {{for the presence of}} an off hook line. If the short was not detected, the software would command the printing of a [...] "Supervsion Failure" [...] (SUPF) and try again with a different junctor. A similar supervision check was performed when an incoming call was answered. Any of these tests could alert for the presence of a bad crosspoint.|$|R
50|$|Ferrods were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the distant office. Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an incoming trunk, or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|R

It has a high back panel, which consists of rows of female jacks, each jack designated and wired as a local extension of the switchboard (which serves an individual subscriber) or as an incoming or <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> line.

50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it {{a function of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> or absorbed it into software.|$|R
25|$|These voltage {{changes on}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the {{subscriber}} as the electrical handshaking stepped through its protocol.

50|$|Larger 5XB {{systems were}} built in the 1960s with more markers. To save money the markers were {{separated}} into two kinds: simple dial tone markers (DTM) just to connect the line to the OR, and completing markers (CM), many times more complex and expensive, to complete the call to or from a trunk. CM has, among other features, the ability to translate the first 3 digits of a phone number (or 6 when using a separate foreign area translator) to identify the correct <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> and handling.|$|R
5000|$|In an idle circuit, {{the central}} office {{supplies}} -48V (nominally) on the ring conductor {{with respect to the}} tip side. A ground start PBX initiates an <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> seizure on an idle circuit by connecting of the ring lead to ground (maximum local resistance of 550 ohms). The central office senses this condition and grounds the tip lead. When the PBX senses this, it goes off-hook, then removes the ground on ring. The central office sends dial tone {{and the rest of the}} call proceeds normally.|$|R
2500|$|Idle <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> {{were picked}} by the {{traditional}} [...] "sleeve test" [...] method, as lines were, except that hunting was the usual practice for trunks rather than a special service feature. The selector moved upward to the proper trunk group, and then through twenty terminals, checking for one with an un-grounded sleeve lead, then selecting and grounding it. If all the trunks were busy, the selector sent back an All Circuits Busy tone (reorder tone). [...] There was no provision for alternate routing as in earlier manual systems and later more sophisticated mechanical ones.|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>trunks</b> were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used analog <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> between switches.|$|R

50|$|Also taking {{advantage}} of the superior versatility of 5XB, Centrex was invented as a service package. Later stored program control exchanges allowed more extensive service features. Autovon originally used a four-wire version of 5XB, with a more complex marker to implement its nonhierarchical polygrid routing system, and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> with additional logic and data storage built in to implement preemption.|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} less {{efficient}} for coin phones, which need special signalling. In urban areas, they were served by older exchanges that had separate junctors for coin phones. Where the 5XB {{was the only}} exchange, a number of work-around methods were devised. Regular and coin phones shared the more complex and expensive coin trunks, or else separate routes were established, or coin trunks connected via tandem switches including the 5XB itself acting as its own tandem. In this last case, the call had to use two connections through the switching fabric: one to connect the line to the coin supervision trunk and another to connect that <b>trunk</b> to the <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{a greater}} degree than in {{previous}} designs, test facilities are centralized into a master test frame. This complex piece of equipment is wired into all common control equipment, and can, for example, automatically exercise the abilities of digit receivers to operate at different speeds, voltages, and other parameters. MTF can select particular <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks,</b> including testing {{the ability of the}} markers to select different lines to particular trunks. This test facility became more valuable as Centrex, direct distance dialing, and other innovations brought more complications to the tasks of translation and trunk selection. For lines, MTF can test translations and conduct voltmeter tests to detect impedance imbalances and other electrical conditions that can impair service.|$|R

50|$|The {{signaling}} unit and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> communicate their status over the E and M leads, {{using a combination}} of Battery and Earth (also known as Ground). The Battery signal used in the standard is nominally âˆ’48VDC. All E&M installations require that the +ve terminal of the Battery is connected to a shared reliable Earth. The maximum distance between the Signaling Unit and the Trunk interface is determined by the resistance of the wire, but will normally be less than 100m for adequate noise immunity.|$|R
50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor <b>circuits</b> with incoming <b>trunks,</b> leaving only the ability to connect those incoming <b>trunks</b> to <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks.</b> In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Stored Program Control {{came to live}} up to {{its promise}} of versatility, and Centrex {{customers}} were among the first in the middle 1970s to be removed from 5XB to 1ESS switch. Complex logic and storage was cheaper in a central computer than in individual <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> hence <b>outgoing</b> calls could be transferred as easily as incoming. Other manufacturers produced similar services, usually calling them something else due to trademark considerations. Northern Electric (later known as Nortel) called their version IBN or Integrated Business Network and enhanced the service with their proprietary P-phone sets in the 1980s.|$|R
