Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequencies of functionally significant SNPs (388 A>G and 521 T>C) and their haplotypes in 6 ethnic groups of Pakistani population through the development of rapid and efficient Tetra amplification refractory mutation system (T. ARMS) genotyping assay. Materials and Methods: Frequencies of alleles, genotype, and haplotypes of two functionally significant Single nucleotide polymorphism in 180 healthy Pakistani subjects and distributions in six ethnic groups by using a single step T. ARMS genotyping assay. Results: The allelic frequency for 388 A>G SNP was 50 % in total Pakistani population with distributions of 9. 7 %, 15. 1 %, 19. 4 %, 16. 1 %, 18. 3 %, and 21. 5 % in Punjabi, Sindhi, Balouchi, Pathan, Kashmiri and Hazara/Baltistan groups respectively; and for 521 T>C SNP it was 23. 9 % in total Pakistani population with distributions of 11. 1 %, 8. 9 %, 15. 6 %, 11. 1 %, 31. 1 % and 22. 2 % in Punjabi, Sindhi, Balouchi, Pathan, Kashmiri, and Hazara/Baltistan groups. Both functionally significant SNPs occurred in four major haplotypes with a frequency of 35. 5 % for 388 A/ 521 T (* 1 A), 40. 5 % for 388 G/ 521 T (* 1 B), 14. 4 % for 388 A/ 521 C (* 5), and 9. 4 % for 388 G/ 521 C (* 15) with varying distributions among six ethnic groups.

40|$|Introduction: Permanent {{hearing loss}} and {{tinnitus}} as side-effects from treatment with the anticancer drug cisplatin is a clinical problem. Ototoxicity {{may be reduced}} by co-administration of an otoprotective agent, but the results in humans have so far been modest. Aim: The present preclinical in vivo study aimed to explore the protective efficacy of hydrogen (H 2) inhalation on ototoxicity induced by intravenous cisplatin. Materials and Methods: Albino guinea pigs were divided into four groups. The Cispt (n = 11) and Cispt+H 2 (n = 11) groups were given intravenous cisplatin (8 mg/kg b. w., injection rate 0. 2 ml/min). Immediately after, the Cispt+H 2 group also received gaseous H 2 (2 % in air, 60 min). The H 2 group (n = 5) received only H 2 and the Control group (n = 7) received neither cisplatin nor H 2. Ototoxicity was assessed by measuring frequency specific ABR thresholds before and 96 h after treatment, loss of inner (IHCs) and outer (OHCs) hair cells, and by performing densitometry-based immunohistochemistry analysis of cochlear synaptophysin, <b>organic</b> <b>transporter</b> 2 (OCT 2), and copper transporter 1 (CTR 1) at 12 and 7 mm from the round window. By utilizing metabolomics analysis of perilymph the change of metabolites in the perilymph was assessed. Results: Cisplatin induced electrophysiological threshold shifts, hair cell loss, and reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the synapse area around the IHCs and OHCs. H 2 inhalation mitigated all these effects. Cisplatin also reduced the OCT 2 intensity in {{the inner and outer}} pillar cells and in the stria vascularis as well as the CTR 1 intensity in the synapse area around the IHCs, the Deiters' cells, and the stria vascularis. H 2 prevented the majority of these effects. Conclusion: H 2 inhalation can reduce cisplatin-induced ototoxicity on functional, cellular, and subcellular levels. It is proposed that synaptopathy may serve as a marker for cisplatin ototoxicity. The effect of H 2 on the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin needs to be further explored...|$|E

In vitro transport and fruit juice inhibition studies using fexofenadine, a medication involved in FJDIs, revealed that in addition to previously implicated <b>transporters,</b> <b>organic</b> cation <b>transporter</b> 1 (OCT 1) and <b>organic</b> solute <b>transporter</b> alpha/beta (OSTα/β) are potential novel targets of fruit juice components.

The apparent Ki values of the enantiomers/diastereomers of ephedrine and norephedrine and the stereoisomers of deprenyl, tranylcypromine, disopyramide, verapamil, pindolol and quinine/quinidine were determined against the contraluminal <b>organic</b> cation <b>transporter,</b> the luminal H+/organic cation exchanger and the luminal choline+ transporter, using the stop-flow luminal or contraluminal capillary microperfusion method. The ephedrine/norephedrine enantiomers/diastereomers had apparent Ki values against the contraluminal <b>organic</b> cation <b>transporter</b> {{in the range of}} 0. 8 to 2. 4 mM, and only norpseudoephedrine showed significant enantioselectivity. The same substrates had apparent Ki values against the luminal H+/organic cation exchanger between 3. 0 and 15. 0 mM, and ephedrine, norephedrine and norpseudoephedrine showed enantioselectivity. The Ki values against the luminal choline+ transporter were even higher (7. 2 - 19. 1 mM) and demonstrated no enantioselectivity. The verapamil and deprenyl enantiomers showed selectivity against the luminal choline+ transporter, as did quinine and quinidine against the contraluminal <b>organic</b> cation <b>transporter.</b> In all other instances enantioselectivity was not observed. In no case was the difference in the Ki values of the enantiomers/isomers greater than a factor of 3. The data confirm the high degree of nonspecificity of the renal <b>organic</b> cation <b>transporters.</b> Evaluation of three-dimensional molecular models of the ephedrine enantiomers/diastereomers suggests that the spatial orientations of the amino group and, to a lesser extent, the OH group and possibly the terminal CH 3 group are of importance for different interactions with the transporters...|$|R

Physical association of its alpha and beta subunits is essential for their polarized basolateral membrane localization and function in the transport of bile acids and other organic solutes. We identified a highly conserved acidic dileucine motif (-EL 20 L 21 EE) at the extracellular amino-tail of <b>organic</b> solute <b>transporter</b> beta from multiple species. To characterize the role of this protein interacting domain in the association of the human beta and alpha subunits and in membrane localization of the transporter, Leu 20 and Leu 21 on the amino-tail of human <b>organic</b> solute <b>transporter</b> beta were replaced with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation study in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that substitution of the leucine residues with alanines prevented {{the interaction of the}} human beta mutant with the alpha subunit.

Computational-based modelling of human <b>organic</b> solute <b>transporter</b> beta suggested that the LL/AA mutation substantially alters both the structure and lipophilicity of the surface, thereby not only affecting the interaction with the alpha subunit but also possibly impacting the capacity of the beta subunit to traffick through the cell and interact with the membrane.

40|$|Cells {{subjected}} to sustained high osmolarity almost universally respond by accumulating compatible organic osmolytes that, {{in contrast to}} inorganic ions, are not deleterious even at high intracellular concentrations.

The fertilized egg of the mouse is protected in the oviduct from perturbations in osmolarity. However, deleterious effects of osmotic stress were evident in vitro even at normal oviductal osmolarity.
