40|$|The arsenic {{content in}} 255 samples of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) varied between 3 and 166 mg/kg. About 65 % {{of the samples}} had an arsenic content above 10 mg/kg. High (low) arsenic {{concentration}} in the fillet corresponds with a high (low) concentration in milt or roe. An excretion experiment with eight human volunteers showed that after the consumption of plaice, 69 - 85 % of the ingested arsenic was excreted in the urine within five days. The <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> present in plaice was isolated by means of extraction, ion-exchange and thin-layer chromatography. Field desorption mass spectrometry of the isolate showed that arsenic was present as arsenobetaine, (CH 3) 3 AICH 2 COO-...|$|E
40|$|The use of radiolabelled probes for in situ {{hybridization}} (ISH) {{bears the}} advantage of high sensitivity and quantifiability. The crucial disadvantages are laborious hybridization protocols, exposition of hybridized sections to film for up to several weeks and the time consuming need to prepare tissue standards with relatively short-lived isotopes like (33) P or (35) S for each experiment. The quantification of rare mRNAs like those encoding for subunits of neurotransmitter receptors is therefore a challenge in ISH. Here, we describe a method for fast, quantitative {{in situ hybridization}} (qISH) of mRNAs using (33) P-labelled oligonucleotides together with (14) C-polymer standards (Microscales, Amersham Biosciences) and a phosphorus imaging system (BAS 5000 BioImage Analyzer, Raytest-Fuji). It enables a complete analysis of rare mRNAs by ISH. The preparation of short-lived (33) P-standards for each experiment was replaced by co-exposition and calibration of long-lived (14) C-standards together with (33) P-labelled brain paste standards. The use of a phosphorus imaging system allowed a reduction of exposition time following hybridization from several weeks to a few hours or days. We used this approach as an example for applications to quantify the expression of GluR 1 and GluR 2 subunit mRNAs of the alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor in the hippocampus of untreated rats, and after intraperitoneal application of the <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> dimethyl arsenic acid...|$|E
30|$|Biogeochemical {{reactions}} are another factor controlling arsenic behavior, {{especially in the}} hydrosphere and pedosphere. Primary production affects arsenic behavior, especially in surface waters, because of the similarity of the chemical characteristics of As(V) and phosphorous. Clean open-ocean water contains 1.5  μg/L arsenic on average (Andreae 1978), whereas in terrestrial waters, the background level of arsenic is <[*] 0.1  μg/L (Matschullat 2000), but the concentration varies widely, depending on the geology and {{on the presence of}} anthropogenic sources along the channels. Biological alteration of arsenic compounds in surface waters has been well documented. Andreae (1978) showed that As(III), DMAA(V) (dimethylarsinic acid), and MMAA (V) (monomethylarsonic acid) are produced in association with increasing phytoplankton activity in Donner and Squaw lakes in California, and since then, numerous studies have documented that increasing eutrophication of estuaries is globally associated with the reduction of arsenate and organo-arsenical production. For example, arsenite and methyl-arsenic species became dominant in Lake Biwa water as biological activity increased (Hasegawa et al. 2010). Seawater contains as much as 1.8  μg/L arsenic, and the arsenic is sometimes concentrated by marine biological activity. For example, arseno-sugar compounds concentrate in phytoplankton and algae, and arseno-betaine concentrates in marine animals (Edmonds et al. 1997). Derivatives such as monomethylarsonic acid can also form by in situ microbial methylation (Reimer and Thompson 1988). In coastal areas, <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> mostly derived from marine biological activity, account for <[*] 1 % of total arsenic in surface sediments (Takeuchi et al. 2005). Takeuchi et al. (2005) noted that <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> in marine sediments are decomposed by microbial activity within several decades; therefore, the formation rate of new <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> is smaller than their degradation rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of four chemical species of arsenic in urine were observed with time, after ingestion {{of three different}} chemical species of arsenic. The arsenic-rich substances ingested, included arsenite-rich wine, arsenate-rich drinking water, and crab meat which contained <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds.</b> After ingestion of arsenite-rich wine, approximately 10 o of the arsenic was excreted as arsenite, {{but the majority of}} the arsenic was methylated to methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid and excreted. After ingestion of arsenate-rich water, elevated levels of both arsenate and dimethylarsinic acid were observed. When crab meat was ingested, none of these four arsenic species were observed at elevated levels until the urine was heated in 2 N NaOH. After the hot base digestion, high levels of dimethylarsinic acid were detected in these samples. The apparent biological half-lives were on the order of 10 hr for inorganic arsenic and 30 hr for the methylated arsenic forms...|$|R
40|$|After the World War II, approx. 40. 000 tonnes of {{chemical}} munitions containing about 13. 000 tonnes {{of chemical}} warfare agents (CWAs) were {{dumped in the}} Baltic Sea [1]. As the artillery shells, aircraft bombs and containers are corroding, the contents are leaking into the environment contaminating the surrounding sediments but also spreading far beyond the dumpsite boundaries [2]. Thus, the necessity of investigations {{on the impact of}} chemical warfare on biota, such as inorganic arsenic and <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> is increasing. Among the dumped CWAs are the vesicant mustard gas (Bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide), the tear gas chloroacetophenone (2 -Chloro- 1 -phenylethanone) as well as the irritants Clark I (Diphenylarsinechloride) and Adamsite (10 -Chloro- 5 -hydrophenarsazine(10)) [3]. Persistent contaminations at dumping sites are mostly related to arsenic containing compounds [2]. Thus, arsenic containing CWAs have been chosen as model CWAs in the present study. Here, we present the first approach to investigate biological effects of CWA mixtures on the health of blue mussels (M. trossulus) under laboratory conditions. The evaluation of the health status was based on a great array of biomarkers encompassing immunocompetence, oxidative stress defence and pathological alterations in different tissues. Chemical analysis of tissue and water samples facilitated an integrated assessment. ...|$|R
40|$|After World War II, {{large amounts}} of {{chemical}} weapons stored on German territory were dumped in the Baltic Sea by order of the allied forces. In addition of being a cheap method of disposal, the belief was that the vast amounts of waters in the oceans would neutralize and absorb the dangerous substances. At least 40. 000 tonnes of chemical munitions containing an estimated 13. 000 tonnes of chemical warfare agents were dumped in the Baltic Sea, primarily in the Bornholm Basin. Other official dumping sites were the Little Belt area and the Gotland Deep. There is evidence, however, that also other areas besides the offical CWA dumpsides are contaminated by chemical warfare agents (CWA). CWA were dumped as artillery shells, aircraft bombs or in containers; partly entire ships loaded with munitions were sunk. Today, munitions are in different stages of decomposition. Metal shells are corroding and contents are leaking into the environment {{at a rate that}} has not been measured so far, posing a possible risk for the Baltic Sea ecosystem. In previous studies, several CWAs of major concern for biota, such as inorganic arsenic and <b>organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> have been found in the sediments within and around dumpsites (Missiaen et al. 2010). Unaware of this risk, human sea-bottom activities, such as bottom trawling, constructions of pipelines and cables as well as windfarms are increasingly claiming space within the contaminated areas. The aim {{of the present study was}} to increase knowledge on the bioavailability and biological effects of CWAs on fish, using a suite of biomarkers in an integrated approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of arsenic {{depends on its}} chemical form. <b>Organo-arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are acknowledged to be less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. Therefore, measurement of the concentration of arsenic as element (&# 147;total arsenic&# 148;) alone is insufficient because organo-arsenicals comprise an important fraction of many environmental samples. In this thesis several milestones on the path towards {{the development of a}} continuous and miniaturised arsenic speciation system based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy was achieved. The well known oxidation reduction cycle (ORC) technique for fabricating polycrystalline gold foils as effective surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates was systematically optimised using a central composite experimental design (CCD). A novel one step electrochemical method, which has been developed for fabrication of nano-porous gold films (NPGF), was demonstrated and optimised as an effective alternative to ORC. Direct-write electron beam lithography and metal-lift-off nanofabrication techniques were also used to create gold nano-pillar systems which serve as SERS substrates. The CCD optimisation model, built from the dimensions of the pillars and the distance between them predicts that higher Raman signal enhancements can be obtained using arrays with 185 nm spacing and 214 nm x 214 nm dimensions. A Raman spectroscopic study of twelve organo-arsenics was reported. The prediction of the normal mode vibrational frequencies and assignments were based on calculations done at the HF, DFT/B 3 LYP levels of theory using 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 3 pd) basis set. The first multivariate detection of the concentration of arsenic species using SERS was demonstrated. The adsorption of arsenic species on the surface has been aided by selecting the arsenic species according to their ionic charges. The species were partitioned into monolayers of charged alkanethiols. Multivariate regression of pure arsenic species over the concentration range of 0 &# 150; 5 mM was shown using a PLS 1 algorithm. Simultaneous determination of arsenate and arsenobetaine has been demonstrated using a two sensor system. PLS 2 was used for calibration of 16 samples containing all the possible combination of the chosen concentration range. The PLS 2 model was applied to adequate amount of independent test sets and the actual concentration of the test sets agreed well with the predicted concentration...|$|R

Some results obtained from the 4 th test are reported herein: 1) An <b>organo-arsenic</b> poison <b>compound</b> paint {{has been found to}} be effective in preventing alga from attaching to the bottom. 2) The insoluble matrix paints were better than the soluble matrix paints as anti-fouling paints. 3) Among the samples containing organic poison and Cu 2 O as poisonus compounds, one containing 20 % of Cu 2 O was subject to fouling to a greater degree. 4) In the three previous papers, sample paint No. 1 had a stable antifouling effectiveness, but in the present test it was subject to fouling to a great degree. This phenomenon suggests necessity of further study as to whether it was due to the change in the environmental conditions or due to the deterioration of anti-sea-water-defacement. 5) Hydroides norvegicus did not attach to sample paints No. 2, 3, 4 and 5. This phenomenon may be due to the effect of organo-halogenic compound poison used in common in these sample paints. ﻿ 1. 有機ヒ素系毒物含有塗料は,すぐれた防藻性を示した. 2.
