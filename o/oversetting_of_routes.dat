Weak women and Ci-devants, their locks {{not yet made}} into blond perukes, their skins not yet tanned into breeches, are accustomed to 'act the Guillotine' by way of pastime. In fantastic mummery, with towel-turbans, blanket-ermine, a mock Sanhedrim of Judges sits, a mock Tinville pleads; a culprit is doomed, is guillotined by the <b>oversetting</b> <b>of</b> two chairs. Sometimes we carry it farther: Tinville himself, in his turn, is doomed, {{and not to the}} Guillotine alone. With blackened face, hirsute, horned, a shaggy Satan snatches him not unshrieking; shews him, with outstretched arm and voice, the fire that is not quenched, the worm that dies not; the monotony of Hell-pain, and the What hour? answered by, It is Eternity!

A quasi-uniform space is an abstract set X equipped with a filterbase of binary relations {U} such that each U contains the diagonal {{as well as for}} some V{U}.
