25|$|On 16 March 1976, Wilson {{announced}} his resignation as Prime Minister (taking effect on 5 April 1976). He {{claimed that he}} had always planned on resigning {{at the age of}} 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s, he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later Lord Stone of Hendon), that he did not intend to serve more than eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> as Prime Minister. Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary. His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as colon cancer, and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress. In addition, by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} of Androgeos' death {{are described in}} the Bibliotheca as follows. Minos received the news of his son's death when he was performing a sacrificial rite {{in honor of the}} Charites at Paros. Overcome by grief, he threw off his garland and ordered for the music to stop, but did complete the sacrifice, from which circumstance the festivals in honor of the Charites at Paros involved no music or flowers from then on. Minos led a war against Athens to avenge the death of his son, but failed to sack the city and prayed to Zeus that the Athenians may be punished. The city was struck with famine and pestilence. The Athenians consulted an oracle as to how to avert the calamity, and were instructed to sacrifice the daughters of Hyacinthus the Lacedaemonian, but this didn't help. The citizens consulted the oracle once again and were told to give Minos whatever he might ask in retribution. The king obliged the Athenians to send several youths every seven <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> to be devoured by the Minotaur. This continued until the Minotaur was killed by Theseus.|$|E

John Callow states that Anne [...] "made the greatest single impact upon his thinking." [...] James also converted to Catholicism eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> after Anne, but he still attended Anglican services until 1676. James preferred to associate himself with Protestant people, such as John Churchill, whose wife later became a very close friend of Anne's youngest surviving daughter Lady Anne. King Charles at the time opposed Catholicism and insisted that James' children be raised in the Anglican faith, although he converted to Catholicism on his deathbed. James and Anne's surviving daughters were raised as Anglicans.|$|E

[...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years,</b> but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence."

2500|$|Fassbinder's {{parents were}} cultured {{members of the}} bourgeoisie. His father mainly {{concentrated}} on his career, which he saw {{as a means to}} indulge his passion for writing poetry. His mother largely ignored him as well, spending the majority of her time with her husband working on his career. In 1951, Liselotte Pempeit and Helmut Fassbinder divorced. Helmut moved to Cologne while Liselotte raised her son as a single parent in Munich In order to support herself and her child, Pempeit took in boarders and found employment as a German to English translator. When she was working, she often sent her son to the cinema to pass time. Later in life, Fassbinder claimed that he saw at least a film a day, sometimes even four a day. During this period, Pempeit was often away from her son for long periods while she recuperated from tuberculosis. In his mother's absence, Fassbinder was looked after by his mother's tenants and friends. As he was often left alone, he became used to the independence and thus, became a juvenile delinquent. He clashed with his mother's younger lover Siggi, who lived with them when Fassbinder was around eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> old. [...] He had a similar difficult relationship with the much older journalist Wolff Eder (c.1905–71), who became his stepfather in 1959.

2500|$|On July 1, The Ike and Tina Turner Revue {{traveled}} by plane to Dallas {{where they were}} to perform at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While on the airplane, the two became embroiled in an altercation, {{which led to a}} physical fight in their limousine. The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine use. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing Ike to slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two [...] "went around like prizefighters for awhile". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa. Once Ike had fallen asleep, Tina grabbed a few toiletries, covered herself and escaped {{from the back of the}} hotel, running across an active freeway before stopping at a local Ramada Inn hotel. She claimed that she later hid at several friends' homes for a time. [...] Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas. He reveals that three weeks after they split, they met for a meal at Ship's Restaurant in Los Angeles. Ike says Tina said maybe they'd get back together after eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years.</b> On July 27, 1976, Tina Turner filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.|$|E

The students were split into groups of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten (<b>year</b> one) and eight <b>or</b> <b>nine</b> (<b>year</b> two) and allocated fortnightly timetabled 1. 5 hours (year one) and weekly timetabled 2 hours (year two) access to a CAL programme, four (year one) or six (year two) sessions in total. After the conclusion of the CAL intervention the students were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire. The RPD knowledge assessment showed a highly significant improvement in scores after the CAL intervention (P-Value &# 60; 0. 001). The students found the CAL programme to be both informative (year one n= 35; year two n= 32) and useful (year one n= 33; year two n= 24) with the majority finding the programme easy to use.
