50|$|A bytestream is a {{sequence}} of bytes. Typically, each byte is {{from a range of}} 256 distinct values (octets), and so the term <b>octet</b> <b>stream</b> is sometimes used to refer to the same thing. An octet may be encoded as {{a sequence}} of 8 bits in multiple different ways (see endianness) so there is no unique and direct translation between bytestreams and bitstreams.|$|E
5000|$|Fast Infoset is {{a higher}} level format built on ASN.1 forms and notation. Element and {{attribute}} names are stored within the <b>octet</b> <b>stream,</b> unlike traditional ASN.1 encoding schemes. In consequence, The conventional XML file can be recovered from the binary stream without reference the XML Schema, and the XML Schema need not be expressed as an ASN.1 definition. (ASN.1 [...] "Tags" [...] are just type names, e.g. String, Integer, or complex types.) ASN.1 together with ECN is used to define the file format.|$|E
50|$|The Internet {{protocol}} {{offers a}} best-effort service of delivering datagrams between hosts. IPv4 is a connectionless internet protocol {{that depends on}} the best-effort delivery approach. IPv4 datagrams may be lost, arbitrarily delayed, corrupted, or duplicated. The applications built on top of it implement the additional services they require on an end-to-end basis. Transmission control protocol (TCP) provides a guaranteed delivery of an <b>octet</b> <b>stream</b> between a pair of hosts to the above layer, internally splitting the stream into packets and resending these when lost or corrupted. User datagram protocol (UDP) provides a thinner abstraction layer which only error-checks the datagrams. Both are transport-layer protocols and provide multiplexing between processes on the same host implemented with port numbers.|$|E
5000|$|The dd Unix {{utility program}} reads <b>octet</b> <b>streams</b> {{from a source}} to a destination, {{possibly}} performing data conversions in the process.Destroying existing data on a file system partition (low-level formatting): dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ ...|$|R
