2500|$|Prior to the election, {{freedom of}} {{association}} had been severely curtailed through various laws; according to Burton Y. Berry, Groza had admitted to this, and had indicated that it came as {{an answer to the}} need for order in the country. Expanding on this, he had stated that the cabinet was attempting to prevent [...] "provocation" [...] from both the far right and far left, and that chaos during the elections would have resulted in his own sidelining by the Communist Party. In regard to the arrest of several Romanian employees of the American Embassy in Bucharest, Groza reportedly claimed that he had tried to set them free, but the PCR had opposed his move. However, in a semi-official context, he had also stated (February 1946): [...] "If the reaction wins, do you think we'll let it live for [...] 24 hours? We'll be getting our payback immediately. We'll get <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> whatever we can and we'll strike".|$|E

He told Surfing World Magazine, “ecording with Julia is cool but we both have <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the wheel. This was an {{opportunity}} to grab the wheel and do some burn-outs". It was released in Australia on 13 July 2012 which peaked at No.2. The title track from the album was released as the lead single in March that year as a free download on Triple J’s Home and Hosed. The second single, [...] "Bird on the Buffalo", is a metaphor for a musing relationship between lovers. and the video features the actress Isabel Lucas. According to Indie Londons Jack Foley, the third single, [...] "Wooden Chair" [...] is [...] "mesmerising in a low-key, effortlessly brilliant manner that also manages to include an intoxicating background whistle. It’s breezy and romantic without really even trying to be". It was featured in the US TV show, Private Practice, in Season 6, Episode 3 [...] "Good Grief". The fourth single, [...] "Monsters", had its video premiered on The Huffington Post.|$|E

2500|$|State {{attorneys}} called {{current and}} former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened. The lead detective testified that his investigation was [...] "very meticulous and careful… I was in no rush just to pick the first guy we got <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> I wanted the right guy." [...] He stated that witnesses gave [...] "strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed", mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening. A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming. In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles, but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal.|$|E

It was the same plan as before, only that we now had <b>our</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the Monte Cristo ridge, from which commanding position our long-range guns could enfilade and even take in reverse some of the enemy's trenches.|$|R

The novelty lies in the fashion the fusion of all the partial classification results are performed. This fusion is (1) more efficient in terms of information theory and leads to more accurate result, (2) general enough to allow other source of information {{to be taken into}} account: Each SVM output is transformed to a belief function, and all the corresponding functions are fused together with some other external evidential sources of information. ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{began to}} speak; a long, strong, {{colourless}} voice quavered in her young throat. She delivered {{the lines of}} Clorinde in the admired interview with Célie, the gem of the third act, with a rude monotony, and then, gaining confidence, with an effort at modulation which was not altogether successful and which evidently she felt not to be so. Madame Carré sent back the ball without raising her hand, repeating the speeches of Célie, which her memory possessed from their having so often been addressed to her, and uttering the verses with soft, communicative art. So they went on through the scene, which, when it was over, had not precisely been a triumph for Miriam Rooth. Sherringham forbore to look at Gabriel Nash, and Madame Carré said: [...] "I think you've a voice, ma fille, somewhere or other. We must try and put <b>our</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] Then she asked her what instruction she had had, and the girl, lifting her eyebrows, looked at her mother while her mother prompted her.|$|R

6000|$|Stupid blockheads, to reverence their St. Edmund's dead Body in this manner? Yes, brother;--and yet, on the whole, {{who knows}} how to reverence the Body of a Man? It is the most reverend {{phenomenon}} under this Sun. For the Highest God dwells visible in that mystic unfathomable Visibility, which calls itself [...] "I" [...] on the Earth. 'Bending before men,' says Novalis, 'is a reverence done to this Revelation in the Flesh. We touch Heaven when we lay <b>our</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a human Body.' And the Body of one Dead;--a temple where the Hero-soul once was and now is not: Oh, all mystery, all pity, all mute awe and wonder; Super-naturalism brought home to the very dullest; Eternity laid open, and the nether Darkness and the upper Light-Kingdoms, do conjoin there, or exist nowhere! Sauerteig used to say to me, in his peculiar way: [...] "A Chancery Lawsuit; justice, nay justice in mere money, denied a man, for all his pleading, till twenty, till forty years of his Life are gone seeking it: and a Cockney Funeral, Death reverenced by hatchments, horsehair, brass-lacquer, and unconcerned bipeds carrying long poles and bags of black silk:--are not these two reverences, this reverence for Death and that reverence for Life, a notable pair of reverences among you English?" ...|$|R
