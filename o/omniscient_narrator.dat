5|$|The novel {{frequently}} changes narrative perspectives, using {{a significant}} amount of interior monologue, direct speech and dramatic irony. Though employing an <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> who occasionally describes the events from a broad perspective, the novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely, principally Stephen Wraysford, Isaebelle Azair, Micheal Weir, Jack Firebrace and Elizabeth Benson.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal monologue (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator.</b> The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrative}} voice shifts between Munira {{and the other}} characters describing the events of their lives, and an <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator.</b> There is also a suggestion of a communal {{narrative voice}}, as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial. This communal voice is at work through the various Gikuyu songs with which Ngugi intersperses the novel; {{there is a great}} reliance placed on such songs, which help tell, through the oral tradition of linking of proverbs and fables, the history of Ilmorog and Kenya before colonial intervention.|$|E
25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics {{and in the way}} that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing fast and loose with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

Moreover, most novels during this time were relatively short, never much longer than 150 pages, and chronicle the individual instead of the lengthy representation of family relationships and national icons. Stylistically, many novels now featured schizophrenic, first-person <b>narrators</b> instead of <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrators.</b>|$|R

Gradually, the three actors who begin the play as the chief puppeteers of the three children begin to speak the childrens lines, relegating the Man and Woman to roles as the parents and occasional narrators. The human actors speaking the childrens lines during the opening automobile journey abandon the puppets in the latter portion of the play to fully embody the adult characters during lengthy monologues.|$|R
500|$|The {{story is}} told {{from the point of}} view of a {{selectively}} <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> who seemingly chooses whether or not to divulge plot points as they occur, causing [...] "a pattern of expectation" [...] on the part of the reader. Although the novella is separated into 24 chapters, some critics—among them Charles B. Ives, Thomas Gullason and Marston LeFrance—believe these chapters are further divided into two parts: chapters 1–9 lead up to Henry's injury, whereas chapters 10–24 map the town's response. Critic David Halliburton wrote in his 1989 book The Color of the Sky: A Study of Stephen Crane that The Monster displayed a more [...] "chastened" [...] and exact style than Crane's earlier works, which were often a mixture of clever bawdiness and epic dramatics—both of which are seen respectively in [...] and The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
500|$|The Hobbit takes {{cues from}} {{narrative}} models of children's literature, {{as shown by}} its <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> and characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, and morally ambiguous Bilbo. The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes [...] "safe" [...] from [...] "dangerous" [...] in its geography. Both are key elements of works intended for children, as is the [...] "home-away-home" [...] (or there and back again) plot structure typical of the Bildungsroman. While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly, the narrative voice contributes significantly {{to the success of}} the novel. Emer O'Sullivan, in her Comparative Children's Literature, notes The Hobbit as one of a handful of children's books that has been accepted into mainstream literature, alongside Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World (1991) and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series (1997–2007).|$|E
500|$|Both the {{character}} and her role as narrator were generally well received by critics throughout the series, and for which Strong received nominations for multiple accolades. In his review of the pilot, Tom Shales of The Washington Post complimented Mary Alice character's narrations, writing: [...] "Even though narration {{has become the most}} overused technique in prime-time television (needed, perhaps, to help move the narrative along quickly now that hour-length shows have shrunk to as little as 41 minutes plus commercials), the producers of Desperate Housewives use it well, and Strong's uncomplaining perkiness adds yet another layer of irony to the enterprise." [...] Peter Schorn of IGN commended Strong's narrations as well as the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide, calling {{the character}}'s [...] "dark secret" [...] the [...] "McGuffin that powers this first season". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Mary Alice's suicide scene as [...] "mysterious and somber but mostly funny", pointing out that the soundtrack music remains [...] "light and happy" [...] throughout and likened the character's narration to that of Glenn Close in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Celia Wren, also writing for The Washington Post, confirmed that the [...] "idyllic small-town" [...] setting of Desperate Housewives as well as Mary Alice's narration style as a deceased and <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> were influenced by Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915), for which she complimented the series, writing: [...] "There's a lot of material to work with: Masters's poetic portrait gallery from 1915 gets its oomph from blowtorching the concept of idyllic small-town America. Its largely embittered personalities speak from beyond the grave of murders, seductions, suicides, hypocrisies, political corruption—enough scandalous behavior to make Desperate Housewives look like Little Women." ...|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{begins with}} a prologue {{in the voice of}} an old man, Charles de Cresseron, that is set in Chapelizod, Ireland, roughly a century after the events of the novel proper. This prologue details how, during an interment at the churchyard of the title, a skull is accidentally unearthed, which bears the marks of two {{crushing}} blows to the head and [...] - [...] even more disconcertingly [...] - [...] a small hole from a trepanning. The novel itself is Cresseron's reconstruction of the history related to this grisly item (though by and large his narratorial voice drops out and the novel is told from a conventional <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator's</b> point of view).|$|R
50|$|Some {{writers and}} {{literary}} critics make {{the distinction between}} the third-person omniscient and the universal omniscient, the difference being that in the universal <b>omniscient,</b> the <b>narrator</b> reveals information that the characters do not have.

40|$|John Bryson's 1985 {{account of}} the Lindy Chamberlain trial and conviction, Evil Angels, {{is one of the}} first Australian {{instances}} of the "new journalism," a form of non-fiction writing that replaces traditional journalistic claims to objectivity with a self-reflexive approach to media processes and a subjective element within reporting. Howevever, Evil Angels is new journalism only in partial and complicated ways. It couples its exposure of media bias with a fixed conviction of both its <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator's</b> objective access to the truth and an explicit political agenda: to persuade the reader of Chamberlain's innocence by telling a true story. In effect, the book borrows some of the techniques of new journalism to locate media bias everywhere but in its own account. It shackles the appearance of the new to a traditional journalistic agenda of finding the truth because this isn't just journalism. Evil Angels is also the seminal Australian example of late twentieth-century true crime writing...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on a one-year-long ethnographic reader-response {{study of}} a book club {{activity}} in a Swedish school, the present article offers a narratological analysis of books used in the book club, {{as well as some}} didactical implications for practice. The analysis of the books shows a preponderance of male protagonists, foreign settings, and first-person and <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrators.</b> The books used were characterized by classic folktale plots. A majority of the books were about animals and adventures. And, many of them dealt with existential themes. When it comes to leading book clubs, the author suggests keeping in mind that struggling readers might be the greatest book lovers, and that stereotypical texts can be used to counteract stereotypes. Interpretations of what is “real” emerge in the book club were shown to be potential starting points for discussions on the conditions of fiction.

5000|$|In the novel's {{coverage}} by {{the video game}} press, it was described as appealing primarily to fans of the game series. Ars Technica's reviewer wrote that it did an admirable job of laying out the fictional universe, and recommended it to those {{with an interest in}} the game. Thunderbolt Games characterized it as [...] "formulaic in just the right ways, as it seamlessly transitions the best aspects of Mass Effect’s interactive fiction into an easily digested, compulsive read for fans of the universe." [...] The reviewer noted that the novel's clean and efficient prose suited the directness of the story and avoided needless infodumps, but did [...] "also restrain the book from truly elevating itself to great science-fiction." [...] SF Signal's review of the [...] "decent, if not spectacular, novel" [...] characterized the writing as [...] "workmanlike" [...] and the characters as undeveloped, and criticized the novel's infodumps as well as the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator's</b> use of exclamation marks.|$|R

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{many scholars}} have compared {{the story to}} the modern genre of detective story. A striking feature in the biblical story, untypical to its parallels, {{is that it does}} not begin with a credible report of the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator</b> about the events that took place before the trial; It immediately opens with the women's testimonies. Thus, the reader is unable to determine whether the account given by the plaintiff is true or false, and he confronts, along with Solomon, a juridical-detective riddle. According to Sternberg, the basic convention shared by the Judgment of Solomon and the detective story genre is the [...] "fair-play rule", which states that both the reader and the detective figure are exposed to the same relevant data.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares two Japanese {{conditional}} constructions — tara and to — used as nonconditionals for narrative {{effect in}} spoken and written narratives collected from five native speakers of Japanese. These two constructions connect clauses where two unrelated past events happened in sequence as in: Miru to/Mitara, ame datta ‘When I looked, it was raining’. Examination of the spoken and written narratives revealed that tara is predominantly {{used in the}} spoken narratives while to is favored in the written narratives. Although both constructions are similar in the unexpected effect, {{the reason why the}} teller uses them differently {{can be attributed to the}} nature of the two different communicative modes. The teller in spoken narrative uses tara to intensify the heightened suspension whereby s/ he creates the surprising effect. The speaker-teller exploits the situatedness of the listener’s co-presence and recreates a story in the way the listener can share suspenseful moments and a sense of uncontrollability. The teller, when writing, uses the to construction to issue a narrator’s voice, 2 ̆ 2 Look what happened. 2 ̆ 2 The writer takes the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator’s</b> viewpoint and directs the reader to an unexpected result even when the writer is absent...|$|R

2500|$|The {{book has}} been {{classified}} as a postmodern, metafictional novel. The first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five is written {{in the style of}} an author's preface about how he came to write the novel. The Narrator begins the novel by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He gives a description of himself, and the book, saying that it is a desperate attempt at scholarly work. He segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: [...] "Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time," [...] thus the transition from the writer's perspective to that of the third-person, <b>omniscient</b> <b>Narrator.</b> (The use of [...] "Listen" [...] as an opening interjection mimics the epic poem Beowulf.) The Narrator introduces Slaughterhouse-Five with the novel's genesis and ends the first chapter by discussing {{the beginning and the end}} of the novel. The fictional [...] "story" [...] appears to begin in chapter two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not fiction. This technique is common to postmodern meta-fiction. The story purports to be a disjointed narrative, from Billy Pilgrim's point of view, of being unstuck in time. Vonnegut's writing usually contains such disorder. He apologizes for the novel being [...] "so short and jumbled and jangled," [...] but says [...] "there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} a satire {{of society as}} a whole, characterised by {{hypocrisy}} and opportunism, {{but it is not}} a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and moral reformism could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator,</b> one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even as far as his readers, accusing all who may be interested in such [...] "Vanity Fairs" [...] as being either [...] "of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood". As Lord David Cecil remarked, [...] "Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw very clearly that they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived." [...] Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the view and representation {{of space in}} Terézia Mora’s prose, primarily based on her novel entitled The Only Man on the Continent (Der einzige Mann auf dem Kontinent). In the universe of the novel the perception of space basically determines the individual’s space of action and highly influences his self-image {{as well as his}} attitude toward alterity. The city not only functions as space, but also forms a multicultural medium which becomes itself the subject of reflection and metanarration. In the novel the anthropological places and non-places, in Augé’s sense, change their function and thus the borders of referential, mental and virtual worlds are blurred, the notion of space itself is revaluated. The protagonist is the Ulysses of our days; his journeys and adventures mainly take place in his imagination. In the virtual world he loses his sense of reality, which can also be perceived in the narrative procedures of the text: the novel is in fact the protagonist’s quest for identity, his endless monologue, which is interrupted by the <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrator’s</b> comments from time to time. In the meantime the evident intertextual context also gets shape: the text maintains an ironical intertextual connection with James Joyce’s Ulysses...|$|R

[...] Susannah Young of Under the Radar evoked that [...] "typically, Tracyanne Campbell writes Camera Obscuras lyrics from an <b>omniscient</b> <b>narrators</b> perspective, but even when she gets more personal, theres still {{a bit of a}} guarded tone at play."
