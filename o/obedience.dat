5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{thrives on}} change and new experiences, and many {{handlers}} find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in <b>obedience</b> competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead {{it to find}} solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the <b>obedience</b> judges. Rally <b>obedience</b> offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional <b>obedience</b> trials.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} <b>obedience</b> and {{punishment}} driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply <b>obedience</b> and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obedience</b> to {{government}} and non-involvement in partisan politics unless submission to law {{amounts to a}} denial of Faith.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-clerical protesters wore colanders to Piazza XXIV Maggio {{square in}} Milan, Italy, on June 2, 2012, in mock <b>obedience</b> to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of <b>obedience</b> was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts {{enabled him to}} withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of <b>obedience</b> to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, <b>obedience</b> and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.|$|E
5|$|On Luffa's deathbed, he {{gave away}} all his belongings, {{including}} his sheets and underclothes. He died on 14 December 1123. Contemporary records {{report that he}} had a great awareness of his responsibilities as a bishop. Six documents of Luffa's survive, besides his profession of <b>obedience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The breed gained {{official}} {{recognition from}} the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five years}} of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, <b>obedience</b> and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and <b>obedience</b> titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} Milgram experiment into <b>obedience</b> by Stanley Milgram {{showed that}} many people lack the psychological resources to openly resist authority, {{even when they are}} directed to act callously and inhumanely against an innocent victim.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} Wulfred's life are the {{surviving}} charters which mention him, {{a number of}} documents from his suffragan bishops pledging <b>obedience,</b> the records of a church council he presided over, and the coinage he issued.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of <b>obedience</b> to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess <b>obedience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce <b>obedience.</b> Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into <b>obedience,</b> meekness and contentment.... The {{philosophy}} of Atheism expresses the expansion {{and growth of}} the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could be resolved politically. He accused military leaders of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for {{what he saw as}} discouraging independent thought and stressing <b>obedience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{stories of}} higher caste Hindus (especially Brahmins), Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself somehow {{trapped in the}} body of an {{untouchable}} and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial. Other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms, his <b>obedience</b> of his Brahmin master and his refusal to enter the holy temple as an untouchable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{dismissal}} of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell for insubordination, Blamey ordered Herring to join him in Port Moresby as the new commander of I Corps. Before departing, Herring met with General Douglas MacArthur, who emphasised that the first duty of a soldier was <b>obedience</b> to his superiors.|$|E
5|$|Simeone Borelli {{joined the}} <b>obedience</b> of Alexander III {{already at the}} end of 1159. Raymond of S. Maria in Vi Lata did the same between February and April 1160. Besides, {{at the end of}} 1159 Victor IV created at least three new cardinal-deacons: Bernard of SS. Sergio e Bacco, Giovanni of S Maria in Aquiro and Lando of S. Angelo, while Alexander III {{appointed}} on February 18, 1160 cardinal-deacon Milo of S. Maria in Aquiro.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Stornato {{joined the}} <b>obedience</b> of Innocent II {{no later than}} 1132; Lectifredo of S. Vitale and Giovanni Dauferio did the same in 1133, Pietro Pisano in 1137, and Desiderio of S. Prassede shortly {{before the end of}} the schism in 1138. It seems that ca. 1135 Comes of S. Sabina also {{abandoned}} Anacletus II.|$|E
5|$|The breed can {{tolerate}} other pets well, although the King Charles {{still has the}} hunting instincts of its ancestors and {{may not always be}} friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for <b>obedience</b> work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>obedience</b> of Anacletus II may be reconstructed basing on {{the letter}} {{addressed}} to king Lothair III of Germany by his cardinals {{soon after his}} coronation. This letter bears the subscriptions of 27 cardinals, including five created by Anacletus II on February 21, a Friday of the ember week. To them should be added also cardinal Oderisio of S. Agata, who later subscribed the bulls issued by Anacletus II.|$|E
5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of Englandâ€“ such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess <b>obedience</b> to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the <b>obedience</b> did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E
5|$|The role of Mr. Jinx the cat {{was played}} by two five-year-old Himalayan cats named Bailey and Misha (sometimes written as Meesha). The American Humane Association oversaw the filming of all scenes where the cats were used and ensured the animals' <b>obedience</b> and {{well-being}} by keeping two trainers and a veterinarian on set at all times.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and <b>obedience</b> to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in <b>obedience</b> trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|Both the Inspector and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, <b>obedience</b> to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and <b>obedience,</b> but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|En Liten HushÃ¥lls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book RÃ¼ckerschÃ¶ld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and <b>obedience,</b> she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} {{on the matter of}} <b>obedience</b> to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.|$|E
5|$|In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and {{captured}} Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. Ã†thelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He {{also managed to}} secure professions of <b>obedience</b> {{from a number of}} southern bishops, including Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in disputes in Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions could be made on the dispute.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for <b>obedience,</b> dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and <b>obedience</b> to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|Later in 915, {{his sons}} Donnchad and Conchobar rebelled against Flann, {{and it was}} only with the aid of Niall GlundÃºb that Flann's sons were forced back into <b>obedience.</b> Niall GlÃºndub also {{compelled}} a truce between Flann and Fogartach mac Tolairg, king of Brega. Niall may also have been acknowledged as Flann's heir at this time. Flann did not long survive, dying near Mullingar, County Westmeath, according to the Prophecy of BerchÃ¡n, on 25 May 916, after a reign of 36 years, 6 months, and 5 days.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by <b>obedience</b> command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands <b>obedience.</b> He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the basic}} laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and {{practical}} application, however, are set down in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's <b>obedience,</b> while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional <b>obedience</b> to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the FÃ¼hrerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitlerâ€”even murderâ€”thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy FÃ¼hrer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E
