Between 1988 and 2008, the Cook Islands sent delegations to all six Summer Olympic games. The size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cook</b> Islander delegation was largest in 1988, when it reached seven athletes. The size of the nation's delegation has not risen past four since then as of the Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Cook Islands compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport. Participation in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament.

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cook</b> Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E

30|$|Poultry’s {{consuming}} RW has <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> infection all <b>the</b> {{time because}} RW has high moisture {{and it must}} be used in a short period <b>of</b> time. In <b>the</b> divisions taken place according to food codex, the products containing meat and protein are among the high risk foods because the conditions required for bacteria to grow are present in them. According to the studies conducted all over the world, the accepted method to control the quality and hygiene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> food is to use microbial standards. To assure <b>the</b> hygiene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> food, Little et al. (2003) recommended some necessary experiments including <b>the</b> total count <b>of</b> bacteria, <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> coliforms especially E. coli and <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens.|$|R
