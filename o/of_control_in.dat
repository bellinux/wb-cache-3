It then expanded its area <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> <b>In</b> all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> order to keep its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can {{be very difficult to}} eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{contemporary}} {{research has}} shown that controlling as a method of management support is gradually becoming more and more popular and recognised in Polish enterprises. This article focuses on the features of the Polish concept <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> at each stage of its development. Methodology/methods: The paper is based on the conceptual analysis and conclusions drawn from the literature on the general review of controlling-related papers. It demonstrates the authors’ own view on the problem included at each stage <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> development <b>in</b> Poland. Scientific aim: The aim of the paper is – first of all – to present the evolution <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>in</b> Poland and to point out the stages of its development [...] The intention of the authors is also to discuss both in theory and in practice the emerging new trends of this modern method of management support. Findings: The paper presents the evolution <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>in</b> Poland. The beginnings <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>in</b> Poland (1989 – 1994), growing academic and practical interest <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> (1995 – 2005) and the start of the 21 st century – the golden age <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> (from 2006 till now) were distinguished as the main stages <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> development <b>in</b> Poland. Moreover, the paper points to the differences among the Polish and German and American ideas <b>of</b> <b>controlling.</b> Conclusions: It should be emphasised that the trend of Polish intensive development <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> theory and practice still continues. Controlling {{has become one of the}} most popular modern methods of management support in Poland. Despite this, there are few empirical studies into the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>in</b> Poland. Conducting this research is necessary to identify the best practices <b>in</b> the field <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>in</b> Poland...|$|R
40|$|At {{present the}} problem <b>of</b> {{internal}} <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is being studied {{by a large}} number of scientists, but as the data analysis demonstrated, they are purely theoretical. At the same time, the need for practical guidance <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector stipulates the development and justification of scientific and methodological aspects of the organization's internal <b>control.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to develop and support scientific and methodical approach <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions. In order to achieve this goal in the following article scientific and practical problems were solved: the necessity <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector, general structure <b>of</b> internal <b>control,</b> stages <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions, a model <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector institutions as a sequence of three separate blocks: the preparatory, organizational and diagnostic, the content of each unit of the proposed model is detailed. It is proved that the key to the model <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is the principle of efficiency and economy. The model <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public institutions includes the stages of an organization's internal <b>control,</b> principles <b>of</b> organization, organizational support, which in turn is divided into regulatory, metho­dological, human, technical, informational, material. The content developed model <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is reflected in a generalized methodological approach to the organization <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector. The proposed scientific and methodical approach is versatile and can be used for the organization <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public institution within the Concept of the Public Internal Financial Control Development to enhance legitimacy and effectiveness of the public institution. Scientific novelty of {{the results of this study}} is developing and substantiating scientific and methodological approach to internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions by developing a model of such an organization. However, the need to develop a model taking into account the human factor in the formation <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> public institutions should be defined as the direction of future research...|$|R

Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century.

The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E

5|$|The long reign (900–942/3) of Causantín (Constantine II) {{is often}} {{regarded}} {{as the key to}} formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at Brunanburh was followed by his retirement as a Culdee monk at St. Andrews. The period between the accession of his successor Máel Coluim I (Malcolm I) and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II) was marked by good relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed Strathclyde, where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century, as part of an agreement with King Edmund of England. This event was offset by loss <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> Moray. The reign of King Donnchad I (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040. MacBeth ruled for 17 years before he was overthrown by Máel Coluim, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's step-son and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III).|$|E

Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and {{it is not clear that}} the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.|$|E
