5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the two species.|$|E
5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

25|$|As an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Defence Lands Committee 1971–73, Hargreaves made key contributions to the Nugent Report, 1973, reviewing the use of land held by the country's armed forces for defence purposes. He became even more aware that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> reserve the countryside for its proper purpose was to keep most people out of it. Although agriculture would be preferable, military exercises seemed less harmful in {{their impact on the}} environment than its use for the recreational choices of a predominantly urban population. This was a conundrum he shared wryly with his audience, gently repeating the point, that the countryside, insofar as it had a purpose for humans, was to grow their food in sustainable ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the people who work on game development teams are men.

The {{solution to the problem of}} societal pigeonholing of female gamers is often identified as interventionist work such as the insertion of women into the industry. Groups like WomenGamers.com and Sony's G.I.R.L. have sought to increase female gamer demographics by giving scholarships to girls considering getting into game development, and game developers like Check Six Games, Her Interactive, Silicon Sisters and Purple Moon have openly courted female coders and developers.|$|E

While the music in Kim Possible is mostly guitar-driven, Berry's scoring experience prior to the show had been exclusively orchestral, composing scores using only a keyboard. A guitarist {{since the age of}} six, Berry himself provided all the guitar and bass musical cues in Kim Possible. Although discussing whether or not popular music featured in the series should be stylistically similar to the score, Disney decided to avoid limiting the show to then-current musical trends because, according to Berry, [...] "trying to be current is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> sound dated."

2500|$|The Heat-generated Food Toxicants (HEATOX) Project was a European Commission-funded {{multidisciplinary}} research project running from late 2003 to early 2007. Its objectives were to [...] "estimate health risks {{that may be}} associated with hazardous compounds in heat-treated food [...] find cooking/processing methods that minimize the amounts of these compounds, thereby providing safe, nutritious, and high-quality food-stuffs." [...] It found that [...] "the evidence of acrylamide posing a cancer risk for humans has been strengthened," [...] and that [...] "compared with many regulated food carcinogens, the exposure to acrylamide poses a higher estimated risk to European consumers." [...] HEATOX sought also to provide consumers with advice on how to lower their intake of acrylamide, specifically pointing out that home-cooked food tends to contribute far less to overall acrylamide levels than food that was industrially prepared, and that avoiding overcooking is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> minimize exposure at home.|$|E
2500|$|Live rock is {{rock that}} has been in the ocean, {{composed}} of limestone and decomposing coral skeleton, usually around a coral reef such as those around Fiji, and is usually covered with beneficial algae, coralline and tiny invertebrates and bacteria that are desirable in the aquarium. Some examples of the microfauna commonly found on live rock are crabs, snails, feather dusters, brittle stars, starfish, limpets, abalones, and an occasional sea urchin, sea anemone, coral, and sea sponge. Also, if the aquarist is unlucky, a mantis shrimp. Bristleworms are also common, most of which, while unattractive, are not harmful and are useful scavengers; some species can be pests, however. The addition of live rock is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> ensure a healthy aquarium, as the rock provides a buffer to maintain high pH (8.0-8.3), alkalinity, and acid-neutralizing capacity. Alkalinity is often known by a rather confusing term, [...] "carbonate hardness", or KH. This is usually measured in [...] "degrees" [...] (dKH) or meq/L.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} activities {{inside the park}} in summer are sport fishing as well as boat or canoe trips. Navigation by boat is in fact one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> explore the park, and the island of Sandön is particularly popular. The park also attracts many bird watchers in winter and spring, especially near Tinäset where the birdlife is the richest. However, {{the part of the}} road that enabled one to get there was closed because it traversed the park — which closing was decided during the park's creation. As a result, the number of tourists at this location diminished considerably. A visitor, information, and nature center was built inside an old barn (dating from 1814) of the Gysinge forge. At Skekarsbo, an observation tower [...] in height was constructed in 1995 and offers a panoramic view over the major part of the park. Several hiking trails exist inside the park, in particular in the north part: on the isle of Mattön (between Gysinge and Sevedskvarn), a part of Gästrikeleden across the park from Gysinge, and from Kyrkstigen up to Skekarsbo. In the southern part, a long trail leads to Tinäset.|$|E

2500|$|Suicide {{rates are}} growing {{worldwide}} {{and over the}} last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is [...] "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.|$|E

I have heard--and have no doubt of the truth of the statement--that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> shoot crows is to go after them in a wagon, keeping your gun, of course, as much out of sight as possible. Crows seem to know exactly what guns are intended for. But they are seldom afraid of a wagon.
