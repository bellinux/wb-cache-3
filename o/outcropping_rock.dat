25|$|The {{geological}} boundary, the park's {{wide range}} of altitudes, and the climatic influence of the Gulf Stream combine to give the park a varied ecology. These ecosystems include bogs, lakes, moorland, mountains, waterways, woodland, parks and gardens. <b>Outcropping</b> <b>rock,</b> cliffs and crags are features of the park. Above , the mountainous sandstone areas support large areas of blanket bog and heath.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{flank of}} the fell running down to {{the summit of the}} Honister Pass road (1,180ft) has much gentler slopes, although there is <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock</b> on either side. Buckstone Hows and Yew Crag overshadow the road.From the top of the pass Gatesgarthdale Beck runs north west to Buttermere while Hause Gill flows east to Seatoller and Borrowdale. Across the road is Grey Knotts in the Western Fells.|$|E

25|$|Alone {{among the}} {{northern}} Helvellyns, Raise has a summit area of <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock,</b> an island amid {{the sea of}} grass. A little {{to the east of}} the top is a rock tor which would be insignificant elsewhere, but in these surroundings draws the eye. A path follows the ridge, with a surfeit of cairns to the south. The view is extensive with all of the major fells being seen. Thirlmere can also be brought into view by walking a few yards to the west.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{flank of}} Pillar {{looks down on}} Mosedale, the more westerly of Wasdale's two main feeder valleys. [...] From Wasdale Head village Pillar appears {{to stand at the}} head of Mosedale, but the valley curves out of sight, actually having its source on the slopes of Scoat Fell. The Mosedale slopes cannot compete with those above Ennerdale, although there is <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock,</b> particularly at Wistow Crags, Elliptical Crag and Murl Rigg.|$|E

60|$|Thirlwell {{sat down}} among the {{driftwood}} and waited, but saw {{no more of}} the man; and then going back quietly, turned into a trail {{that led to the}} mine. The trail was rough and narrow; in places, short brush had sprung up, and there were patches of <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock.</b> It would be difficult for anybody to follow it without making some noise, but although he stopped and listened no sound came out of the gloom.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was at its}} highest, and it {{was very}} hot; the road was a rough track where loose stones lay among the heavy dust. Where water ran down the {{hillside}} in artificial channels, there were palms and belts of foliage; elsewhere <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock</b> and stones flung up a dazzling brightness. In the background, rugged peaks rose against a sky of intense blue, and far off on the opposite hand a misty gleam indicated the sea.|$|E
60|$|Dave {{was working}} his way along a small ridge of <b>outcropping</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{when he came to}} one rock that stood out much higher than the rest. From this point he gazed around, {{to see if he could}} locate any of the others of the party.|$|R
50|$|The top is grassy with {{a little}} <b>outcropped</b> <b>rock,</b> a cairn marking the top. A larger cairn is set {{on the brink of}} the north face.

60|$|There {{was evidently}} {{something}} about Diana's Grove which both interested and baffled him. Before leaving, he moved {{all over the}} place unsatisfied, and in one spot, close {{to the edge of the}} Brow, where there was a deep hollow, he appeared to be afraid. After returning several times to this place, he suddenly turned and ran in a panic of fear to the higher ground, crossing as he did so the <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock.</b> Then he seemed to breathe more freely, and recovered some of his jaunty impudence.|$|E
60|$|Traveling was {{comparatively}} easy all day. Wind {{and fire}} had thinned the bush, cleaning out dead trees and undergrowth, {{and the snow}} lay smooth upon the <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock.</b> Here and there they struck a frozen creek which offered a level road, and when dark came they had made an excellent march. Gerald was glad of this, because all the food he could save now would be badly needed before the journey was finished. For all that, he felt anxious as he sat beside the camp-fire after his frugal supper.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{hour before}} they reached one, and Nasmyth was {{conscious}} of an unpleasant pain in his side and a headache which he supposed resulted from want of food. For all that, he scrambled after his companion down an almost impossible descent, where trees of increasing size grew up among <b>outcropping</b> <b>rock</b> and banks of stones. When he reached the bottom {{he found himself in}} a deep rift filled with densely-matted underbrush, through which a swift stream flowed. Its banks promised a slightly easier road, though now and then they had to wade through the water, which was icy cold. Noon came and they had seen no sign of life, except two or three willow-grouse which they failed to dislodge from cover; but Lisle held on, his course running roughly in a line with the river.|$|E

40|$|The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity {{encountered}} sedimentary <b>outcrop</b> <b>rocks</b> at its landing site. Spherules with diameters in the millimeter range {{were found}} to weather from the <b>outcrop</b> <b>rocks.</b> With Opportunity s miniaturised M ssbauer spectrometer MIMOS II, hematite was detected in spherules and in the outcrop matrix [1, 2]. Figure 1 shows the target Berry Bowl, where brushed outcrop and an accumulation of spherules could be investigated on sols 46 and 48 of Opportunity s mission. Hematite undergoes a transition from a weakly ferromagnetic above to an antiferromagnetic state below the Morin temperature (T(sub M) approx. 265 K for chemically pure, crystalline hematite). The magnetic hyperfine splitting (B(sub hf)) shows a general decrease with increasing temperature and a drop of approx. 0. 8 T at T(sub M). The quadrupole splitting ((Delta) EQ) changes its sign at T(sub M), with negative values above and positive values below the transition. Crystallinity and particle size influence the magnitude and temperature dependence of the magnetic splitting and the quadrupole splitting [3]...|$|R

40|$|Multispectral imaging {{from the}} Panoramic Camera (Pancam) {{instruments}} on the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity has provided important new insights about the geology and geologic {{history of the}} rover landing sites and traverse locations in Gusev crater and Meridiani Planum. Pancam observations from near-UV to near-IR wavelengths provide limited compositional and mineralogic constraints on the presence abundance, and physical properties of ferric- and ferrous-iron bearing minerals in rocks, soils, and dust at both sites. High resolution and stereo morphologic observations have also helped to infer {{some aspects of the}} composition of these materials at both sites. Perhaps most importantly, Pancam observations were often efficiently and effectively used to discover and select the relatively small number of places where in situ measurements were performed by the rover instruments, thus supporting and enabling the much more quantitative mineralogic discoveries made using elemental chemistry and mineralogy data. This chapter summarizes the major compositionally- and mineralogically-relevant results at Gusev and Meridiani derived from Pancam observations. Classes of materials encountered in Gusev crater include <b>outcrop</b> <b>rocks,</b> float rocks, cobbles, clasts, soils, dust, rock grindings, rock coatings, windblown drift deposits, and exhumed whitish/yellowish salty soils. Materials studied in Meridiani Planum include sedimentary <b>outcrop</b> <b>rocks,</b> rock rinds, fracture fills, hematite spherules, cobbles, rock fragments, meteorites, soils, and windblown drift deposits. This chapter also previews the results of a number of coordinated observations between Pancam and other rover-based and Mars-orbital instruments that were designed to provide complementary new information and constraints on the mineralogy and physical properties of martian surface materials...|$|R
