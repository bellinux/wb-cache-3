5|$|Johnson's first fight {{probably}} {{took place}} in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter.

By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|LARPs {{can have}} any genre, {{although}} many use themes and settings derived from genre fiction. Some LARPs borrow a setting from an established work in another medium (e.g., The Lord of the Rings <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> of Darkness), while others use settings {{based on the}} real world or designed specifically for the LARP. Proprietary campaign settings, together with rulesets, are often the principal creative asset of LARP groups and LARP publishers.|$|E
5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (<b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E

5|$|Spindizzy is {{an action}} and puzzle game played from an {{isometric}} perspective. Players can view {{the playing field}} from four angles, and rotate between them. The game {{takes place in a}} fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform—and modify its mobility as a result—between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is completely explored.|$|E
