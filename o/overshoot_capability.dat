40|$|An applied {{research}} program is {{considered for a}} preliminary design and development of a flexible ablative covering for the space shuttle vehicle that could be easily replaced and/or refurbished. The program was structured to concentrate resources on the major technical problem areas associated with the flexible ablator concept. These areas included: (1) fabrication of a suitable woven carpet reinforcement, (2) modification of a flexible ablator formulation for filling the woven carpet construction, and (3) testing of the flexible ablator concept. Several approaches were evaluated to obtain a flexible ablator. The final recommended solution was {{one in which the}} ablative filler was based on a low-density formulation of the elastomeric shield material series (ESM). The preferred approach is one in which a light-weight fabric backing is bonded to preformed and fully cured ESM, and the composite tufted with Astroquartz fiber to the desired tuft or pile density. Ablation tests performed in a hyperthermal arc facility demonstrated the ablation performance of the concept and <b>overshoot</b> <b>capability</b> of the system...|$|E

Back then, we knew how to parse sentences using augmented finite state machines and context-free and transformational grammars, and could translate results into SQL, predicate calculus, or equivalent semantic networks. We knew we’d need more powerful representations, so we targeted or invented temporal logics, modal logics, and nonmonotonic logics. But by the 1980 s, we realized that we had only scratched the surface — just beneath was a complex of common-sense meaning representations, then referred to as frames, scripts, and knowledge representations. At present, we’ve made real progress in natural language technologies: keyword-based information retrieval is in everyday use; spelling and grammar checkers are commonplace; speechto-text and text-to-speech utilities are widely available if not yet an integral part of how most people communicate with computers; and limited but useful translation services on the Web convert documents from one language to another. But we still cannot successfully use natural language to query and command computers. To understand the difficulty, try typing or speaking to a system that has a natural language interface (NLI) — it won’t understand many of your questions and commands because they <b>overshoot</b> the <b>capabilities</b> of the NLI system or the underlying application to which it interfaces. Not only that, you can’t really know what you can ask about — does the system handle map or statistical queries? — so your questions and commands also undershoot the system’s capabilities. This mismatch between user expectations and NLI system capabilities is called the habitability problem. We’ve developed LingoLogic, an interface technology that uses menus to specify natural language queries and commands in order to combat the habitability problem. 1 It doesn’t claim to provide deep understanding of natural language. Rather, we see it as a potentially widely useful human interface technology that can extend the Semantic Web...|$|R
