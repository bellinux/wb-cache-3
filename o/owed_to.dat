5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> them by the occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E
