[...] The HH-43 could not hover at higher altitudes, and the HH-3 needed to stage from forward bases in Laos to provide rescue coverage for North Vietnam. [...] This deficiency was partially remedied {{by the addition of}} air refueling capability to the HH-3s. [...] Within {{a few months after the}} first combat refueling in June 1967, in flight refueling [...] became standard, but staging bases in Laos continued to be used. [...] In addition to extending the range of the group's refuelable helicopters, air refueling permitted them to dump fuel when needed to lighten the aircraft, and to enable it to hover for rescues at high altitudes, knowing that it would be able to connect with a tanker after the rescue attempt and <b>on-load</b> sufficient fuel to return to its home base.|$|E

40|$|Spatiotemporal {{context is}} crucial in modern mobile {{applications}} that utilize increasing amounts of context to better predict events and user behaviors, requiring rich records of users' or devices' spatiotemporal histories. Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile devices. Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information, but this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection, and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper we motivate the feasibility of <b>on-loading</b> large amounts of context and introduce PACO (Programming Abstraction for Contextual <b>On-loading),</b> an architecture for <b>on-loading</b> data that optimizes for location and time while allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The PACO API's innovations enable <b>on-loading</b> very dense traces of information, even given devices' resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for Android, we demonstrate that PACO can support expressive application queries entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses PACO's energy consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, PACO facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.

50|$|To {{maintain}} the voltage at the customer's service within the acceptable range, electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at electrical substations or along the distribution line. At a substation, the step-down transformer {{will have an}} automatic <b>on-load</b> tap changer, allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps. For long (several kilometres) rural distribution circuits, automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line. These are autotransformers, again, with <b>on-load</b> tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes. At each customer's service, the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment, usually ±5% of the nominal voltage. Since these taps are not automatically controlled, they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer.|$|E
40|$|MPI Alltoall {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{communication}} intense collective operation used in many parallel applications. Recently, the supercomputing arena has witnessed phenomenal growth of commodity clusters built using InfiniBand and multi-core systems. In this context, it is important to optimize this operation for these emerging clusters to allow for good application scaling. However, optimizing MPI Alltoall on these emerging systems is not a trivial task. InfiniBand architecture allows for varying implementations of the network protocol stack. For example, the protocol can be totally <b>on-loaded</b> to a host processing core or it can be off-loaded onto the NIC or can use any combination of the two. Understanding the characteristics of these different implementations is critical in optimizing a communication intense operation such as MPI Alltoall. In this paper, we systematically study these different architectures and propose new schemes for MPI Alltoall tailored to these architectures. Specifically, we demonstrate that we cannot use one common scheme which performs optimally on each of these varying architectures. For example, <b>on-loaded</b> implementations can exploit multiple cores to achieve better network utilization, and in offload interfaces aggregation can be used to avoid congestion on multi-core systems. We employ shared memory aggregation techniques in these schemes and elucidate the impact of these schemes on multi-core systems. The proposed design achieves a reduction in MPI Alltoall time by 55 % for 512 Byte messages and speeds up the CPMD application by 33 %...|$|R

50|$|Though {{the protein}} was {{originally}} {{identified as a}} Topoisomerase I redundant factor, the TRF4 gene product was later shown to be required for sister chromatid cohesion. Wang et al. showed that Trf4 is actually a DNA polymerase, which they called Polymerase κ. This polymerase is {{also referred to as}} Polymerase σ. In the same paper in which they identified Pol σ, Wang et al. suggested a polymerase switch model for establishment of cohesion. In this model, upon reaching a CAR, the cell switches DNA polymerases in a mechanism similar to that used in Okazaki fragment synthesis. The cell off-loads the processive replication polymerase and instead uses Pol σ for synthesis of the CAR region.
