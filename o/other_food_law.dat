40|$|The {{twenty-first century}} has {{witnessed}} a fundamental reform of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> in the European Union, {{to the point}} where modern EU <b>food</b> <b>law</b> has now come of age. This book presents the most significant elements of these legal developments with contributions from a highly qualified team of academics and practitioners. Their analysis is based on a shared vision of the structure and content of EU <b>food</b> <b>law.</b> The book takes the perspective of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> embedded within general EU law. It highlights the consequences of this combination and provides insights into both substantive and procedural <b>food</b> <b>law.</b> Taking the General <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> as a focal point, this handbook analyses and explains the institutional, substantive and procedural elements of EU <b>food</b> <b>law.</b> Principles are discussed as well as specific rules addressing food as a product, the processes related to food and communication about food to consumers through labelling. These rules define requirements on subjects like market authorisation for food additives, novel foods and genetically modified foods, food hygiene, tracking & tracing, withdrawal & recall. The powers of public authorities to enforce <b>food</b> <b>law</b> and to deal with incidents are outlined. Attention is given to the international context (WTO, Codex Alimentarius) as well as to private standards. In addition to the systematic analysis, the book includes selected topics such as nutrition and health policy, special foods, food import requirements, food contact materials, intellectual property and animal feed...|$|R

The thesis focuses on providing comprehensive {{view of the}} general part of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> but also discusses selected aspects of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> and related issues.

My thesis is based on the aproach of analysis and synthesis. I also use the linguistic, logical and historical method in my thesis. The comparative method is used in the two last chapters (Chapter Twelve and Thirteen) which deal with the comparison of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> in the Czech Republic and selected countries. The text of my thesis is divided into chapters, subchapters and parts. The thesis is composed of fourteen chapters (including Preface - Chapter One, Introduction - Chapter Two and Conclusions - Chapter Fourteen).

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> in the Czech Republic and Abroad. The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to {{introduce}} <b>food</b> <b>law</b> of the Czech Republic and England, {{with an emphasis on}} EU <b>food</b> <b>law.</b> As this field is very broad, only basic attributes and some interesting parts and issues of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> may be covered. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. In the first chapter relevant legal sources are introduced. <b>Food</b> <b>law</b> is regulated by many rules. Generally, these sources may be divided into primary and secondary legislation both at national and EU level. Furthermore, some important international aspects of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> are laid down as well. The second chapter simply is to present legal definitions of essential terms within the scope of Czech and EU law. The third chapter is crucial one for following chapters as it establishes most of general principles in environmental law as well as principles specifically applicable in the field of <b>food</b> <b>law.</b> It is often referred to these principles later in the thesis. Furthermore, this chapter also contains an introduction of the European Safety Food Authority and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed as well as many ways of national control of food safety.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the law are the desired outcomes of legal regulation. They are preferred by the legislature states of affairs. Determining the {{objectives of}} <b>food</b> <b>law</b> and their relationships is important, because {{it is necessary for}} the proper interpretation of the all provisions relating to this field of law. The objectives of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> are articulated in the Regulation No 178 / 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of <b>food</b> <b>law,</b> establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. Under that regulation, the objectives of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> are: the protection of human life and health, protection of consumers’ interests, protection of fair practices in food trade, protection of animal health and welfare and plant health, protection of environment and also achievement of the free movement of food in the Community. In article the author presents the scope of the objectives of <b>food</b> <b>law</b> and determines their relationship. The author concludes that the priority in <b>food</b> <b>law</b> is to protection of human life and health. Second main objective of <b>food</b> <b>law,</b> is protection of consumers’ interests.
