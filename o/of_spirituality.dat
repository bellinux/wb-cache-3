5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity.

He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> and God.|$|E

Mountfort's career received a fillip when he was commissioned to design the St John's Anglican church at Waikouaiti in Otago. A small timber structure in the Gothic style, it was completed on 19 December 1858 on land donated by the ex-whaler Johnny Jones. It is still in use as a church, the oldest such structure in southern New Zealand. Now {{within the boundaries of}} the city of Dunedin its simple pit-sawn timber interior successfully conjures a sense <b>of</b> <b>spirituality.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger {{argued that}} the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will {{experience}} a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their fall.

This radical group, active in the area of the Rhine and the Netherlands, strove for a form <b>of</b> <b>spirituality</b> immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.|$|E

5|$|The Church of the SubGenius {{was founded}} by Ivan Stang (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox) as the SubGenius Foundation.

5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was {{an essential element of}} the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source <b>of</b> <b>spirituality,</b> companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{the nature}} of ‘Biblical Spirituality’ as an {{academic}} discipline is reviewed from a methodological perspective. Two core aspects are indicated: the importance of ancient expressions <b>of</b> faith (<b>spiritualities)</b> in the Bible, {{and the importance of}} modern expressions <b>of</b> faith (<b>spiritualities)</b> as they draw on the Bible. Based on this framework, as a first application of such a nature within the field <b>of</b> Biblical <b>Spirituality,</b> the relevant publications of an Old Testament scholar are evaluated; in this case, those of J. H. Eaton. Such an analysis opens an arena for discussion on whether this model <b>of</b> Biblical <b>Spirituality</b> holds promise for wider application...|$|R
