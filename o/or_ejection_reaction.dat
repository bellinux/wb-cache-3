50|$|The voiced {{aspirated}} and ejective consonants, both pulmonic and clicks, {{contain a}} voiceless interval, which Miller (2003) attributes {{to a larger}} glottal opening than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. Phonetically, however, they are voice contours, starting out voiced but becoming voiceless for the aspiration <b>or</b> <b>ejection.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the NCAA and FIBA, if a team {{is reduced}} to five players by injury <b>or</b> <b>ejection,</b> {{and one of them}} commits a sixth foul or is ejected, play {{continues}} with that team reduced to four players. A team automatically loses the game by default if fewer than two players remain in the game.|$|R
5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are {{devoid of}} known moons {{due to the}} Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites <b>or</b> <b>ejection.</b> The lifetime of moons in the instability region is from 10 million to a billion years.|$|R
2500|$|Land itself {{cannot be}} {{converted}} or [...] "stolen" [...] by possession.

50|$|For {{measurements}} with percentage as unit, like growth, yield, <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> fraction, {{the standard}} deviation will have percentage points as unit. Mistakenly using percentage as the unit for {{the standard deviation}} is confusing, since percentage is also used as a unit for the relative standard deviation, i.e. standard deviation divided by average value (coefficient of variation).|$|R

5000|$|Juǀʼhoansi {{and some}} of the {{neighboring}} languages are typologically unusual in having contrastive partially voiced consonants. They have aspirate and ejective consonants, which are normally incompatible with voicing, in voiceless and voiced pairs.

30|$|The PEM fellows {{performing}} FOCUS {{completed a}} {{case report form}} (CRF) immediately following {{the performance of the}} FOCUS. The CRF included the fellows’ interpretation of {{the presence or absence of}} significant pericardial effusion and the qualitative global systolic function as either normal or depressed. We used dichotomous qualitative variables for pericardial effusion (absent/trivial versus present) and cardiac function (normal versus depressed) rather than attempting to quantify amount of fluid <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> fraction.|$|R
40|$|During sepsis, RV EDV and ESV vary {{independently}} {{of changes in}} Pra and ejection pressure. These data {{can be explained by}} assuming that the RV is a highly compliant chamber during filling, such that changes in RV EDV do not alter RV wall stress (preload) <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> efficiency (RVEF). Thus, changes in RV EDV should proportionally alter RV ESV. Furthermore, the slope of the ESV/EDV relation should be inversely proportional to ejection efficiency...|$|R

50|$|One {{contributing}} {{reason is}} that current golf cart safety features are insufficient to prevent passenger falls <b>or</b> <b>ejection.</b> Golf carts moving at speeds as low as 11 mph could readily eject a passenger during a turn. Furthermore, rear-facing golf cart seats are associated with high rates of passenger ejection, and most golf carts do not have brakes on all four wheels (typically brakes are only on the rear axle wheels, thus extremely limiting their braking power).|$|R

2500|$|If bit 15 (on FAT16) or bit 27 (on FAT32) is not set when {{mounting}} {{the volume}}, the volume was not properly unmounted before shutdown <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> {{and thus is}} in an unknown and possibly [...] "dirty" [...] state. On FAT32 volumes, the FS Information Sector may hold outdated data and thus should not be used. The operating system would then typically run SCANDISK or CHKDSK on the next startup (but not on insertion of removable media) to ensure and possibly reestablish the volume's integrity.|$|R
50|$|Margaret's {{inclination}} of 57° {{is close}} to the limit of stability. The intermediate inclinations 60 < i < 140 are devoid of known moons due to the Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons in this region to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> over 10 million to a billion years. Margaret's periapsis precession period (Pw) is almost 1.6 million years long. Margaret itself may be ejected from the Uranian system in the far future.|$|R
5000|$|Long {{relievers}} often {{enter in}} the first three innings of a game when the starting pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitching, lack of endurance, rain delays, injury, <b>or</b> <b>ejection.</b> The hope is that the long reliever {{will be able to get}} the game under control, and hopefully his team's offense will be able to help get the team back into the game. The hope is also that the long reliever will pitch long enough to save other relievers in the bullpen from having to pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Made {{without a}} loading gate <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> mechanism, the [...]25 caliber lipfire is still another unique design. To load or unload, this seven-shot pocket gun {{required}} the cylinder {{to be removed}} to load or unload the cylinder. With just a few exceptions, most of the [...]25 caliber revolvers carry no markings. It is speculated that these may have been very late to market before {{the loss of the}} patent suit as a 'spit in your eye' gesture to Smith and Wesson. A 3-inch barrel was standard.|$|R

50|$|Shells {{can also}} be divided into three configurations: bursting, base <b>ejection</b> <b>or</b> nose <b>ejection.</b> The latter is {{sometimes}} called the shrapnel configuration. The most modern is base ejection, which was introduced in World War I. Both base and nose ejection are almost always used with airburst fuzes. Bursting shells use various types of fuze depending {{on the nature of}} the payload and the tactical need at the time.|$|R
50|$|A {{player who}} commits his/her sixth (and subsequent) {{personal}} foul and must {{remain in the}} game because the team has no eligible players remaining, or a player who was the last player to commit six fouls, and with no eligible players following an injury <b>or</b> <b>ejection,</b> is called back to the game, is charged with a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul, with the penalty of a single free throw, regardless of offensive or defensive foul. The player cannot be ejected from the game for a technical foul caused by such.|$|R
50|$|Harper {{has been}} known to stay in the dugout until the final out of All-Star Games, even though in that {{particular}} game, an exception permits that once the manager removes the starters from play they are not obligated to remain. Many promptly shower then leave the park. During each of his first four All-Star Games, Harper indicated that he had remained for the entire game, anticipating the opportunity to re-enter should his team require it due to a shortage of players by reason of either injury <b>or</b> <b>ejection.</b>|$|R
40|$|As a {{basis for}} PIV measurement, {{turbulent}} characteristics of a flow were investigated by LDA over {{two different types of}} urban roughness in wind-tunnel. The roughness consists from long series of street canyons with unit aspect ratio. Different shapes of roof - flat and pitched - provide a different internal boundary layer above canyons. The latter one, generated by pitched roofs, is significantly more turbulent and thus slower then above flat roofs. Momentum flux and corresponding transport exhibits the largest deviation specially at the roof level. Ventilation in the streets is therefore distinct from each other. Quadrant analysis was applied for vertical profiles and cross-sectional areas in canyons in order to detect a domination of sweep <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> events and to find a linkage to the third moment of velocity for both cases. The overall goal of the project is to find any of coherent structure produced by the roof edge as a low momentum region <b>or</b> an <b>ejection</b> formed by hairpin...|$|R

25|$|Ejection {{fraction}} (EF) is a parameter {{related to}} SV. EF is {{the fraction of}} blood ejected by the left ventricle (LV) during the contraction <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> phase of the cardiac cycle or systole. Prior {{to the start of}} systole, during the filling phase or diastole, the LV is filled with blood to the capacity known as end diastolic volume (EDV). During systole, the LV contracts and ejects blood until it reaches its minimum capacity known as end systolic volume (ESV). It does not completely empty. The following equations help translate the effect of EF and EDV on cardiac output Q, via SV.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} research. Assessing {{the impact}} of chronic {{hyperglycemia}} on {{the parameters of the}} protein, lipid metabolism and platelet-coagulation haemostasis in patients with active phase of acromegaly. Materials and methods: The research included 58 patients with the active phase of acromegaly (36 women and 28 men), median age 50 (43, 57) years, disease duration 9. 0 (5. 0, 15. 0) years, 26 of whom had verified diabetes mellitus. Results: Biochemical parameters and parameters of haemostasis in patients with active phase of acromegaly with normoglycemia differed from the control group by higher levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, an increase in the average volume of platelet aggregation and enhancement of their function. The presence of diabetes mellitus was accompanied by the increase in concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides, decrease in high-density lipoproteins, and increase in fibrinogen concentration, soluble fibrin-monomeasured complexes, as well as reduction of disaggregation properties of platelets and enhancement of <b>ejection</b> <b>reactions.</b> Conclusion: The presence of diabetes mellitus with acromegaly can be regarded as a significant risk factor for atherogenic dyslipidemia, hyperfibrinogenemia and platelet disfunction...|$|R
50|$|A more simplistic {{application}} of safety wire, more {{commonly referred to}} as witness wiring, is the use of light gauge, single strand, copper wire to provide positive visual confirmation of the security or closure of specific equipment within the aerospace industry. Common applications include the security of safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, and safety equipment bags, but also as an assurance that critical system switch covers remain in place, such as those associated with the {{application of}} fire suppression, <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> systems.

40|$|Understanding {{myocardial}} remodelling, {{and developing}} tools for its accurate quantification, is fundamental {{for improving the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} myocardial infarction patients. Conventional clinical metrics, such as blood pool volume <b>or</b> <b>ejection</b> fraction, are not always distinctive. Here we describe a method for the classification of myocardial infarction from 3 D diastolic and systolic left ventricle shapes, represented by point sets. Classification features included global geometric, shape and thickness descriptors, and a random forest was used for classification. Results from cross validation show an accuracy of 92. 5 % (leave-one-out) and 91. 5 % (5 -fold), improving the 87 % obtained with ejection fraction thresholds. These results suggest that refined remodelling metrics provide information beyond standard clinical descriptors...|$|R
