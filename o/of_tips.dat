40|$|International audienceHere we {{show that}} the {{phosphorylation}} <b>of</b> histone acetyltransferase <b>Tip</b> 60, a target of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 -encoded transactivator Tat, {{plays a crucial role}} in the control of its catalytic activity. Baculovirus-based expression and purification <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 combined with mass spectrometry allowed the identification of serines 86 and 90 as two major sites of phosphorylation in vivo. The phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 was found to modulate its histone acetyltransferase activity. One of the identified phosphorylated serines, Ser- 90, was within a consensus cyclin B/Cdc 2 site. Ser- 90 was specifically phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin B/Cdc 2 complex. Accordingly, the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 was enhanced after drug-induced arrest of cells in G(2) /M.

40|$|Abstract: The {{transfer}} of acetyl groups from acetyl coenzyme A to the ε amino group of internal lysine residues is cata-lyzed by Tip 60, {{which is in}} the MYST family of nuclear histone acetyltransferases (HATs). The tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 seems to be a unique modification. We present evidence that Tip 60 is modified on tyrosine 327 by Abl kinase. We show that this causes functional changes in HAT activity and the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>TIP</b> 60, which forms a complex with Abl kinase. The Tip 60 mutation Y 327 F abolished tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 HAT activity, and caused G 0 -G 1 arrest and association with FE 65. Thus, our findings for the first time suggested a novel regulation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60. Regulation was through phosphorylation of tyrosine 327 by Abl tyrosine kinase and de-pended on environmental conditions, suggesting that the tyrosine residue <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 is important for the activation process...|$|R

500|$|The case {{remained}} unsolved {{for over}} three years, {{partly due to the}} volume <b>of</b> <b>tips</b> received by police investigators. The biggest tip was from a Madeira Beach police bulletin describing a similar rape of a 24-year-old Canadian tourist some two weeks before the murders (See below under [...] "Witnesses"). Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect. Local police posted images of Chandler's handwriting on the brochure on billboards in the Tampa Bay area, leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a work order that he had written. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. and billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people. Through handwriting analysis, the two samples were [...] matched conclusively. Another of Chandler's neighbors, and one of the secretaries on the investigative task force, thought that Chandler resembled the composite sketch of the suspect in the seemingly related rape case. A palm print from the brochure was also matched to Chandler. He had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared. In 1990, when the television show Unsolved Mysteries was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family, Chandler and his then-wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to Port Orange near Daytona Beach.|$|E

40|$|Parametric study <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> {{injection}} {{was implemented}} experimentally on a subsonic {{axial flow compressor}} to understand the underlying flow mechanisms of stability improvement of the compressor with discrete tip injection. Injector throat height varied from 2 to 6 times the height <b>of</b> rotor <b>tip</b> clearance, and circumferential coverage percentage ranged from 8. 3 % to 25 % of the annulus. Static pressure fluctuations over the rotor tip were measured with fast-response pressure transducers. Whole-passage time-accurate simulations were also carried out {{to help us understand}} the flow details. The combinations <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> injection with traditional casing treatments were experimentally studied to generate an engineering-acceptable method of compressor stall control. The results indicate that the maximum stability improvement is achieved when injectors are choked despite their different sizes. The effect of circumferential coverage percentage on compressor stability depends on the value of injector throat height for un-choked injectors, and vice versa. Tip blockage in the blade passage is greatly reduced by the choked injectors, which is the primary reason for stability enhancement. The accomplishment of blockage diminishment is maintained in the circumferential direction with the unsteady effect <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> injection, which manifests as a hysteresis between the recovery <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> blockage and the recovery <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> leakage vortex. The unsteady effect is primarily responsible for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> injection with a partial circumferential coverage.
