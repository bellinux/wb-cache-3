But the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices--and it's going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang.|$|E
6000|$|There was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> seaman, however, {{which they}} could not quite {{reconcile}} with his known character. This was a tendency to groan heavily when he was being loaded.

60|$|The Major {{was still}} looking at him quietly, but with {{protruding}} eyes, when {{the front door was}} flung open, releasing a flood of gaslight {{on the face of the}} fading mist; and another figure in pyjamas sprang or tumbled out into the garden. The figure was much longer, leaner, and more athletic; the pyjamas, though equally tropical, were comparatively tasteful, being of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe. The man was haggard, but handsome, more sunburned than the other; he had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes, and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal-black hair with a much lighter moustache. All this Father Brown absorbed in detail more at leisure. For the moment he only saw <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man; which was the revolver in his hand.|$|E

But there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bald-face that a man has to learn: he never gives the trail to mortal creature. If you see him comin', and you value your skin, {{you get out of}} his path. If you don't, there's bound to be trouble. If the bald-face met Jehovah Himself on the trail, he'd not give him an inch. O, he's a selfish beggar, take my word for it. But I had to learn all this.

60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nests {{has always}} puzzled me. The soft lining has {{generally}} {{more or less}} rabbit fur. Sometimes, indeed, there is nothing else, and a softer nest one could not wish to see. But where does he get it? He would not, I am sure, pull it out of Br'er Rabbit, as the crow sometimes pulls wool from the sheep's backs. Are his eyes bright enough to find it hair by hair where the wind has blown it, down among the leaves? If so, it must be slow work; but Chickadee is very patient. Sometimes in spring you may surprise him on the ground, where he never goes for food; but at such times he is always shy, and flits up among the birch twigs, and twitters, and goes through an astonishing gymnastic performance, as if to distract your attention from his former unusual one. That is only because you are near his nest. If he {{has a bit of}} rabbit fur in his bill meanwhile, your eyes are not sharp enough to see it.|$|E
6000|$|And here I must say, friends, {{that however}} much the Roman Catholics {{may be wrong}} on many points, they have remembered <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> life {{everlasting}}, which we are too apt to forget; and that is, that everlasting life cannot be a selfish, idle life, spent only in being happy oneself. They believe that the saints in heaven are NOT idle; that they are eternally helping mankind; doing all sorts of good offices for those souls who need them; that, as St. Paul says of the angels, they are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister {{to those who are}} heirs of salvation. And I cannot see why they should not be right. For if the saints' delight was to do good on earth, much more will it be to do good in heaven. If they helped poor sufferers, if they taught the ignorant, if they comforted the afflicted, here on earth, much more will they be able, much more will they be willing, to help, comfort, teach them, now that they are in the full power, the full freedom, the full love and zeal of the everlasting life. If their hearts were warmed and softened by the fire of God's love here, how much more there! If they lived God's life of love here, how much more there, before the throne of God, and the face of Christ! ...|$|E
6000|$|But while {{degeneration}} {{is admitted}} {{as an element}} in history, there seems no tangible reason for believing that the highest state which Bushmen, Fuegians, or Diggers ever attained, and from which they can be thought to have fallen, was higher than a rather more comfortable savagery. There are ups and downs in savage as in civilised life, and perhaps [...] "crowned races may degrade," [...] {{but we have no}} evidence to show that the ancestors of the Diggers or the Fuegians were a [...] "crowned race". Their descent has not been comparatively a very deep one; their presumed former height was not very high. As Mr. Tylor observes, [...] "So far as history is to be our criterion, progression is primary and degradation secondary; culture must be gained before it can be lost". <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past of savages we do know: {{it must have been a}} long past, and there must have been a period in it when the savage had even less of what Aristotle calls (------) even less of the equipment and provision necessary for a noble life than he possesses at present. His past must have been long, because great length of time is required for the evolution of his exceedingly complex customs, such as his marriage laws and his minute etiquette. Mr. Herbert Spencer has deduced from the multiplicity, elaborateness and wide diffusion of Australian marriage laws the inference that the Australians were once more civilised than they are now, and had once a kind of central government and police. But to reason thus is to fail back on the old Greek theory which for every traditional custom imagined an early legislative hero, with a genius for devising laws, and with power to secure their being obeyed. The more generally accepted view of modern science is that law and custom are things slowly evolved under stress of human circumstances. It is certain that the usual process is from the extreme complexity of savage to the clear simplicity of civilised rules of forbidden degrees. Wherever we see an advancing civilisation, we see that it does not put on new, complex and incomprehensible regulations, but that it rather sloughs off the old, complex and incomprehensible regulations bequeathed to it by savagery.|$|E

50|$|A crucial {{difference}} between the noumenon and the thing-in-itself is that to call something a noumenon is to claim a kind of knowledge, whereas Kant insisted that the thing-in-itself is unknowable. Interpreters have debated whether the latter claim makes sense: it seems to imply that we know at least <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thing-in-itself (i.e., that it is unknowable). But Stephen Palmquist explains that {{this is part of}} Kant's definition of the term, to the extent that anyone who claims to have found a way of making the thing-in-itself knowable must be adopting a non-Kantian position.|$|E

In this cosmic aspect, Vishnu is also called Mahavishnu (Great Vishnu). By an Advaitan interpretation, this notation is not surprising as followers of Advaita philosophy, in particular, Smartas believe that Vishnu and Shiva are the same and are hence different aspects of the one Supreme Being.|$|R
