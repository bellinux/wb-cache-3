40|$|This paper investigates whether {{exposure}} to sexually <b>objectifying</b> media {{leads to more}} tolerance toward sexual harassment {{of women in the}} context of a real-life scenario. Moreover, given that self-objectification reflects the internalization of gender-based inequalities, we also tested whether self-objectification was associated with greater tolerance toward sexual harassment of women. Two hundred and ten undergraduate students (112 men) were asked to watch sexually <b>objectifying</b> (vs. neutral) video clips before completing a questionnaire assessing tolerance toward sexual harassment. As expected, we found that watching sexually <b>objectifying</b> video clips led to more victim blame when evaluating a real-life scenario of sexual harassment, but it did not affect general attitudes toward sexual harassment. Moreover, trait self-objectification was associated with general attitudes toward sexual harassment of women, with more tolerance toward sexual harassment among people with high trait self-objectification. Incontrast, neither {{exposure to}} sexually <b>objectifying</b> video clips nor trait self-objectification affected perpetrator blame. These findings suggest that even short exposure to sexually <b>objectifying</b> media contributes to shifting attitudes toward sexual harassment of non sexualized women in the real world, and they also illuminate the role of self-objectification in maintaining gender-based inequalities. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|Feminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf {{write that}} women's sexual liberation led women to a role reversal, whereby they viewed men as sex objects, {{in a manner}} similar to what they criticize about men's {{treatment}} of women. Psychologist Harold Lyon suggests that men's liberation is a necessary step toward woman's liberation. This was especially apparent during the girl power era of the 1990s and early 2000s. Men are often <b>objectified</b> by other men. Research has suggested that the psychological effects of objectification on men are similar to those of women, leading to negative body image among men.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a {{study by}} Dietz, {{conducted}} at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually <b>objectified</b> women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial Damsel in Distress"), opponents ("evil or as obstacles {{to the goal of}} the game"), and trivial ("females depicted in fairly non-significant roles"). However, the study is criticized for not including a wide range of video games for study and for including old games published up to twenty years ago which do not represent current industry standards, for example, an increased presence of strong female characters.|$|E
40|$|Objectification {{research}} has largely ignored {{the potential impact}} of Internet activities, such as online self-portrayal, on women’s self-objectification and whether this may interact with traditional <b>objectifying</b> stimuli. In response to these research gaps, the present study had two goals: first, to investigate if portraying the self to others online leads to self-objectification in women; second, to test whether priming with <b>objectifying</b> content from traditional media moderates the effect of online self-portrayal on self-objectification. We conducted an online experiment with a two (priming stimuli: <b>objectifying</b> vs. neutral) by two (audience: online audience vs. no audience) between-subjects design among 221 women aged 18 to 25. All participants created an online profile, which consisted of choosing an avatar and writing a self-description. Participants in the online audience condition self-objectified more strongly than did participants in the no audience condition. However, this effect only held among those who had been primed with <b>objectifying</b> stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Across {{two studies}} we {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} exposure to <b>objectifying</b> television in which women are shown as sexual objects {{increases the likelihood of}} harassing conduct. In both studies (Ns = 141; 120), male participants were exposed to one of three TV clips in which women were portrayed (a) as sexual objects (<b>objectifying</b> TV), (b) in professional roles, or (c) excluded (a nature documentary). Study 1 showed that men exposed to <b>objectifying</b> TV reported greater proclivity to engage in sexual coercion and manifested more gender-harassing behavior than participants in the other conditions. Study 2 further demonstrated that exposure to <b>objectifying</b> TV increased participants’ conformity to masculine gender role norms, which, in turn, mediated the relation between experimental condition and gender harassment. Together, the two studies suggest that media content plays a central role in activating harassment-related social norms, which in turn encourage or inhibit harassing conduct...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of sexually <b>objectifying</b> music video exposure on young women's implicit bodily self-perception and the moderating role of self-esteem. Fifty-six college women of normal weight were either exposed to three sexually <b>objectifying</b> music videos or three neutral music videos. Perceived and ideal body size were measured {{both before and after}} video exposure, using horizontally stretched and compressed photographs of the participant's own body in swimming garment. As expected, only women low (but not high) in self-esteem were negatively affected by the sexually <b>objectifying</b> content of the music videos: they perceived themselves as bigger and showed an increased discrepancy between their perceived and ideal body size after video exposure. The neutral music videos did not influence women's bodily self-perceptions. These findings suggest that body image is a flexible construct, and that high self-esteem can protect women against the adverse effects of sexually <b>objectifying</b> media...|$|R
25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it <b>objectified</b> women; the {{decision}} was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media got wind of the story and decided to write about it as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17.
