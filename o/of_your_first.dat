Jason Birchmeier wrote that [...] "most fans taking a chronological approach to his catalog should be fairly numb to Esham's exploitative shock attempts. Yet {{if this is}} one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> experiences with Esham the Unholy, this album should pack a punch with its dark nature." [...] In May 1996, Esham {{released his}} fifth studio album, Dead Flowerz. It peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, for unknown reasons, she [...] "fled" [...] to Singapore {{where she}} married Elbert Lewis, an auditor for Socony-Vacuum Oil Company (later merged with Mobil Oil). How they met is unknown. From the {{available}} documentation, the assumption would be they {{met on the}} dock when she arrived in Singapore. However, {{in a letter to}} her dated February 8, 1942, Elbert wrote, [...] "Do you remember, dearest, the morning <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> arrival in Singapore, seven sweet years ago, when I pushed all the boats out of the harbor so your ship could come in?" [...] which could be either romantic metaphor, or a hint he was waiting for her there (the same letter mentions a clearly metaphorical female character he calls [...] "Elfin," [...] to which Elbert attributes much [...] "good luck" [...] he apparently thinks they had in the past).|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{season was}} the first in which Button was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was ambitious for the season, saying: [...] "This year I could be a front-runner. We want to run alongside the top teams. I want to be consistently in the points and on the podium." [...] He took his first ever podium in the second race of the season—third-place at the Malaysian Grand Prix—saying afterwards, [...] "There are no words to describe the feeling <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> podium". He followed it up two weeks later with another third-place in Bahrain. In the next race at Imola, he took his first pole position and finished second behind Michael Schumacher. His results for the season were impressive: he took 10 podiums in 18 races, and failed to score points in only three. Button came third in the Drivers' Championship, behind the two utterly dominant Ferrari drivers, and helped BAR to take second in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
2500|$|In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: [...] "Millions of {{you have}} blood {{relatively}} unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord calls you 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, {{for many of the}} grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... You came from Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. You are of royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen". Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: [...] "With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea". Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: [...] "Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands".|$|E
