When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> <b>type,</b> (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax".

To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

This study examines access to sanitation facilities in Nigeria and explores the socioeconomic and locational factors that influence the type of facility used by households. The study utilizes cross-sectional data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, and employs descriptive and inferential statistics for data analyses. The results indicated that 44. 2 % of households used various kinds of pit latrines, followed by toilets that flush to septic tanks (10. 3 %). While only 5. 3 % of the respondents used toilets that connect to sewer systems, about a third (31. 5 %) lacked sanitation facility and the remaining 8. 7 % used other types of sanitation facilities. Results from chi-square analysis and ANOVA revealed significant statistical differences between the type of sanitation facility households used and their place of residence, geopolitical zone, ethnicity, educational attainment and wealth.

40|$|M. Sc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Retirement {{adequacy}} targets {{provide an}} indication {{as to how}} much wealth is needed at retirement to provide for an adequate retirement income. These targets have design and strategy implications for social security systems and retirement funds and can be used by individuals to assess their preparedness for retirement. The primary aim of this research was to estimate retirement adequacy targets for one- and two-adult households from Statistics South Africa’s Income and Expenditure Survey 2005 / 2006. Retirement adequacy targets were expressed as wealth-earnings ratios, defined as the multiple of salary at retirement required for a comfortably adequate retirement. The targets would be sufficient to provide for the higher of the preretirement lifestyle or subsistence living. An important subsidiary aim was to examine consumption behaviour at and in retirement. Non-healthcare consumption was not found to change at retirement if income levels remained at pre-retirement levels. For certain households, healthcare expenditure may increase on retirement and may be funded from the contributions to retirement savings that are no longer required in retirement. The retirement adequacy targets decreased with retirement age but there was not a clear relationship between retirement savings rates and the targets. Retirement adequacy targets decreased with income but were complex functions of household composition, sex of the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> <b>type</b> of settlement, age, home ownership and the retirement savings rate. Where household members retired at different times, the earnings of the younger person during the semi-retirement phase reduced the targets substantially. The retirement adequacy targets estimated implied that the replacement ratio targets used by retirement funds and those suggested in the literature would not provide an adequate retirement income for most households. The results may thus {{have a significant impact on}} retirement planning in the future...|$|E
40|$|Consumer demand {{theory has}} long {{dominated}} {{the study of}} household consumption behavior. This theory, however, incorporates only the effects of prices and income on consumer demand, with tastes as given. In addition, most previous empirical studies have been applying this theory to aggregate data and to an incomplete household expenditure/demand system;This study {{draws attention to the}} use of household characteristics in household demand analysis. The main goal {{of this study is to}} estimate a complete, theoretically plausible system of household demand to investigate the impact of household characteristics on household consumption behavior in the province of Central Java, Indonesia. The extended model of the Almost Ideal Demand System is used for empirical estimation. It is hypothesized that households with different characteristics have different preferences and that these differences in preferences can be investigated by making household demand dependent not only on prices and income but also on household characteristics. It is also hypothesized that the study of household consumption behavior should use household data to satisfy the restrictions imposed on this theory. The data used in this study are from the urban households observed in the 1984, 1987, and 1990 National Household Socioeconomic Surveys in the province of Central Java, Indonesia;The results show that the joint effect of household size by age-sex composition, age and education level of the household head, education level of the spouse, housing status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> <b>type</b> of household, and main source of income are statistically significant in predicting the parameters of household consumption behavior in the province of Central Java, Indonesia.

Compared with the estimated model of household demand that does not include household characteristics, the estimated parameters/elasticities of the AIDS model that includes household characteristics are significantly different. This study also found that the use of household budget data in household demand analysis satisfies the parameter restrictions required in consumer demand theory.

30|$|After {{classifying}} <b>households</b> {{according to}} <b>the</b> above-mentioned categories <b>of</b> classes, we have estimated {{sources of income}} of these <b>households</b> from different <b>types</b> of labour and capital. It {{is also important to}} note that household’s typewise data on capital stocks are not readily available for Indian economy. Therefore, we have used <b>the</b> income <b>of</b> self-employed and own account category of <b>households</b> as proxy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital income. Now to estimate the capital income this way, we have cross-tabulated the NSSO 68 th round employment–unemployment survey data between households categories (using demographic profile) and types of labour (using status of work profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households).</b> Again to obtain <b>the</b> income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> from different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> labour, we have prepared another cross-table between <b>the</b> <b>household</b> categories and <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> labour we have defined for our study purpose.|$|R

40|$|In Burkina Faso, {{policies}} influencing {{land management}} {{are bound to}} have deep impacts {{on the environment and}} on <b>the</b> livelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural population. Two such policies are <b>the</b> national program <b>of</b> gestion de terroirs villageois and the support programs for cotton cultivation by the private sector and the national government. This paper provides insights on <b>the</b> current livelihoods <b>of</b> rural <b>households,</b> identifies <b>the</b> key determinants <b>of</b> their livelihoods and categorizes them into <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> This is necessary to then analyze <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned policies on land management strategies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> <b>The</b> analysis includes <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> agricultural intensification and expansion on livelihoods as both have influenced <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> livelihood assets. <b>The</b> working paper uses data collected across three representative villages in the Ioba Province in south-western Burkina Faso in 2006 / 2007. It shows that poorer farm households are excluded from institutions that provide access to resources and have only limited means to employ agricultural practices to maintain soil fertility. The study indicates that differences in <b>the</b> land management <b>of</b> <b>household</b> <b>types</b> lead to differences in social and environmental outcomes. In other words, <b>the</b> livelihood strategies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed <b>households</b> vary. However, livelihood outcomes in the study area are rather homogenous. <b>The</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> livelihood outcomes makes it difficult to categorize <b>households</b> into different <b>types.</b> One reason for this result might be that {{it is not enough to}} look at data that cover only one production year. Another reason is that farm <b>households</b> in <b>the</b> study region compensate limitations in one livelihood asset through a stronger focus on livelihood strategies that generate other assets...|$|R

40|$|The British Crime Survey (BCS) {{has been}} used to develop a number of {{statistical}} models that describe property crime victimization at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>household.</b> This paper gives an overview of what has been learnt from these studies. In terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predictors <b>of</b> crime, it is now well established that both household and area characteristics play important roles: in particular, household affluence has a positive effect on crime victimization, in contrast to the negative effect exerted by area affluence. However, findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s have emphasized that crime victimization cannot be regarded as random even when the statistical model is conditioned on these known characteristics. Based on a more general model which allows for this nonrandomness, the present study uses simulations to illustrate <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and area characteristics in respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following: how <b>household</b> <b>types</b> differ in predicted property crime victimizations, both in aggregate and differentially by crime type; how area characteristics are associated with rates of victimization; how household victimization histories affect predictions of subsequent crime event...|$|R

Multivariate predictive models of regular and problem gambling group membership were constructed using socio-demographic and gambling mode variables. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> socio-demographic variables, <b>household</b> <b>type</b> (particularly being single or {{living in a}} group household) was a predictor for both gambler types. In addition, male gender and formal education below tertiary level were associated with regular gambling. Gambling mode proved to be of greater explanatory power for both groups. In particular, electronic gaming machines (EGMs) were strongly associated with problem gambling. While these results provide a necessary knowledge base, the gaps they highlight are as valuable as the empirical results they provide. Any comprehensive understanding of risk factors in demographically distinctive jurisdictions such as the Northern Territory requires a broader approach; one that meaningfully extends beyond the non-indigenous population...|$|R

Unlike other studies of household labor supply model, which assume that all <b>the</b> <b>households</b> follow <b>the</b> same decision making structure, we assume there are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>household,</b> <b>the</b> cooperative <b>type</b> and the non-cooperative type.

Under this assumption, we formulate a mixture model using the latent class analysis framework. This model explicitly takes account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unobserved heterogeneity in decision making structures. <b>The</b> empirical estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model is based on register data from Statistics Norway. We find {{that more than half}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> belong to <b>the</b> non-cooperative <b>type.</b> And these <b>households</b> on average have lower education level than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative type.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{research}} is to understand the current travel attitudes and habits of families, and also to understand the current usage patterns of technologies in families. The study aimed to identify where opportunities exist for digital technologies to influence travel attitudes and habits in families. In order to conduct research into the role that technologies could have in this setting, <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> use needed to be fully understood. Therefore an exploratory approach was taken. A greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily travel patterns of family units and how they interact with technologies {{on a daily basis}} was achieved. The study used a mixed methods approach to capture and explore travel behaviours and use of technologies in 13 family households. A questionnaire was given to households to gather data on demographic variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family that might affect their travel behaviour. A diary study captured patterns in household travel and in how and when family members use technologies in their everyday lives. Interviews were carried out to increase understanding of their motivations and explanations for why they chose certain modes <b>of</b> transport and <b>the</b> reasons behind their uses <b>of</b> technology. <b>The</b> <b>household</b> <b>types</b> associated with high car usage were households with two or more cars and households with an older child (10 + years old) living in the house. <b>The</b> adults in <b>households</b> with an older child also took more single occupancy car trips. Several one car households, who travelled by active modes of transport regularly on working days/weekdays, took a higher proportion of weekend trips by car.
