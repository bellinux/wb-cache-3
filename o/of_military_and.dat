5|$|Versions of the 767 {{serve in}} a number <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> {{government}} applications, with responsibilities ranging from airborne surveillance and refueling to cargo and VIP transport. Several military 767s have been derived from the 767-200ER, the longest-range version of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{remains an}} iconic {{figure in the}} Arab world, {{particularly}} for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies, and anti-imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom, and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan City. Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> dictatorial rule in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a blow for the French {{defenders}} of Martinique, who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> food supplies. Although another supply frigate {{broke through the}} blockade and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized {{over the next two}} years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E

5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} {{a swath of}} new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme system <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height in nearly five centuries, and indeed {{for the next four}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|British anti-invasion {{preparations}} of the Second World War entailed {{a large-scale}} division <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian mobilisation {{in response to}} the threat of invasion by German armed forces in 1940 and 1941. The British army needed to recover from the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and 1.5 million men were enrolled as part-time soldiers in the Home Guard. The rapid construction of field fortifications transformed much of the United Kingdom, especially southern England, into a prepared battlefield. The German invasion plan, Operation Sea Lion, was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces. Today, little remains of Britain's anti-invasion preparations; only reinforced concrete structures such as pillboxes are commonly found.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria hosted six KC-135 Stratotanker {{aircraft}} and 200 support personnel {{for the war}} effort in Afghanistan in 2001, {{which was the first}} stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II. International military relations were further expanded in April 2006, when Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases, the Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in Aytos as joint military training facilities. The same year Foreign Policy magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the USAF due to its proximity to the Middle East. A total of 756 troops are deployed abroad as part of various UN and NATO missions. Historically, Bulgaria deployed significant numbers <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian advisors in Soviet-allied countries, such as Nicaragua and Libya (more than 9,000 personnel).|$|E

The audience <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{no country}} in Africa has a {{permanent}} {{seat on the}} Security Council. Although no one nation from Africa has formally been put forward {{as a candidate for}} membership on the Security Council, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria are seen as the strongest choices. Algeria has gained {{a great deal of respect}} for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; Egypt has the second-largest economy in Africa and the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations, enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world, and hosts the headquarters of the Arab League; Ethiopia was also one of the founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the African Union Commission; South Africa has the third-largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy, and is one of the largest contributors <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.|$|E

5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed special taxes on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Downes began a tour <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> {{other medical}} centres in India, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Canada. While in London, he {{arranged}} for Doris and Valerie to be formally {{presented to the}} King and Queen at Buckingham Palace by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Downes foresaw a major war, fought in the islands {{to the north of}} Australia. While in London, he took steps to obtain the services as consultants of two eminent Australian physicians, the surgeon Sir Thomas Dunhill and Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical diseases. The outbreak of the Second World War caused Downes to curtail the North American leg of his tour, and return to Australia in October 1939.|$|E

5|$|In later life, Morshead {{turned down}} various offers <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> {{diplomatic}} posts, {{as well as}} the governorship of Queensland. He did serve as president of the Boy Scouts Association of New South Wales and the Big Brother Movement, a British youth emigration support scheme, and was a trustee of the Gowrie scholarship trust fund, which provided assistance to the descendants of Second World War veterans. In 1957 he was appointed chairman of a committee which reviewed the group of departments concerned with defence. The Menzies government accepted the committee's recommendation that Supply and Defence Production be amalgamated, but dropped the key proposal that the Department of Defence absorb the Departments of Army, Navy and Air. This reform was finally carried out by the Whitlam government in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E
5|$|The Kangxi Emperor reverted many of {{the bureaucratic}} reforms of the Oboi faction after 1669, but {{continued}} {{to rely on the}} Deliberative Council as a body of Manchu counselors whom he consulted on a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civil matters, especially those that were too sensitive or complex to handle through the regular bureaucracy. The emperor allowed the president of the Censorate to sit on the Council, then in 1683, after the rebellion of the Three Feudatories had been suppressed and peace reestablished, he decided that the lieutenant-generals of the Banners would no longer be automatic members. After that, the Deliberative Council became more oriented toward civil administration. Nonetheless during the First Oirat–Manchu War, fought from 1687 to 1697 between the Qing Empire and the Dzungar Khanate, the Kangxi Emperor often consulted the Council {{on how to deal with}} Galdan, the khan of the Dzungars, and with the Dzungars' enemies the Khalkha Mongols. During his reign, the Council met on imperial request and transmitted the result of its deliberations to the emperor, who usually followed the Council's advice.|$|E
