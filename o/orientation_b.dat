Deterministic dosimetry, so far used to analyze human exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF), is highly time consuming if the previously-mentioned variations are considered. Stochastic dosimetry is an alternative method to build analytical approximations of exposure at a lower computational cost.

40|$|Abstract A {{recently}} developed model of grain boundary (GB) segregation, {{in terms of}} the five macroscopic parameters of GB orientation, has been exercised to explore the anisotropy of GB segregation. The five macroscopic GB orientation parameters are defined by means of the orientations of the two crystallographic planes that terminate the crystals {{on either side of the}} GB, and a twist angle. Some important conclusions include the following: (a) the composition of a boundary depends on all five parameters of GB <b>orientation,</b> (<b>b)</b> the segregation profile across a GB depends on the two planes which terminate the adjacent crystals, (c) the composition profile across GB’s terminated by identical crystallographic planes is symmetric, but is asymmetric when GB’s are terminated by different planes, and (d) the strength of the segregation on one side of a GB influences the extent of segregation on the other.

40|$|The {{world around}} us {{contains}} a variety of visual information, both first-order (luminance-defined) and second-order (defined by characteristics other than luminance). Previous {{studies suggest that the}} human visual cortex employs distinct mechanisms for segregating regions whose borders are defined by modulations of first- and second-order properties. This study uses a new approach of human psychophysics and fMRI experiments to explore the brain responses to both first-order and second-order (orientation, spatial frequency and contrast) texture borders. The results reveal differential activation among these modulations both in known retinotopic areas and in higher occipital/parietal regions. Orientation modulated textures elicit significantly different responses compared to modulations of other properties; whereas spatial frequency and contrast modulated textures produce similar responses. These findings suggest that higher visual cortical areas are heavily involved in texture processing, with a functional dissociation between segregating textures with modulations of (a) <b>orientation,</b> (<b>b)</b> spatial frequency or contrast and (c) luminance...|$|E

40|$|Objective. In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{association}} between mothers’ attachment style and their infants’ sleep patterns. We hypothesized that low levels of anxiety and avoidance attachment orientations would enable the mother to use more efficient strategies to put her infant to sleep, and in time the infant will assimilate these strategies and consequently develop suitable and more independent sleep routines. Participants and Measures. The 125 mothers {{who participated in this}} study completed (a) a measure of attachment <b>orientations</b> (<b>b)</b> and a measure of mother’s perception of their infant’s sleep patterns. Results. The results indicated that the greater the mothers’ avoidance attachment orientation is, the longer it takes to put the child to bed at night, the more wakeful the child is at night, and the more the night wakings are. However, for mothers with high anxiety attachment orientation, there is a positive correlation between child’s age and {{the time it takes to}} put him/her to bed, such that the older the child, the longer it takes.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of unrealistic Gulf Stream separation in numerical {{models of the}} ocean has prompted many theories about possible mechanisms that influence the separation of a western boundary current from the coast. In this paper, the joint effects of (a) coastline <b>orientation,</b> (<b>b)</b> bottom topography, and (c) inertia on the midlatitude jet separation are explored in a wind-driven two-layer quasigeostrophic model. It is shown that topographic effects are of importance in high eddy activity regions and that eddy–topography interactions strongly influence the separation process. In order for the western boundary current to separate from the coastline and cross the f/h contours associated with the continental rise, eddy fluctuations need to be weak at the separation point. This can be achieved either by introducing a positive wind stress curl {{in the northern part}} of the domain or by increasing the inertia of the western boundary current. In both cases, the separation is facilitated by low eddy activity, resulting in a decoupling of the upper layer from the lower layer when the current crosses the f/h contours. 1...|$|E

40|$|We study quantum {{interference}} {{effects on the}} transition strength for strongly localized electrons hopping on 2 D square and 3 D cubic lattices {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field B. These effects arise from the interference between phase factors associated with different electron paths connecting two distinct sites. For electrons confined on a square lattice, with and without disorder, we obtain closed-form expressions for the tunneling probability, which determines the conductivity, between two arbitrary sites by exactly summing the corresponding phase factors of all forward-scattering paths connecting them. An analytic field-dependent expression, valid in any dimension, for the magnetoconductance (MC) is derived. A positive MC is clearly observed when turning on the magnetic field. In 2 D, when the strength of B reaches a certain value, which is inversely proportional to twice the hopping length, the MC is increased by a factor of two compared to that at zero field. We also investigate transport on the much less-studied and experimentally important 3 D cubic lattice case, where it is shown how the interference patterns and the small-field behavior of the MC vary according to the <b>orientation</b> of <b>B.</b> The effect on the low-flux MC due to the randomness of the angles between the hopping direction and the <b>orientation</b> of <b>B</b> is also examined analytically.
