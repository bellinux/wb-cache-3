5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its <b>orbital</b> <b>precession)</b> over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E

The answer is still negative. The present-day down-track accuracy would be adequate for Mimas, Enceladus, Thetys, Dione, Rhea and Titan and inadequate for Hyperion, Iapetus and Phoebe. Instead, the size of the systematic errors induced by the mismodelling in the key parameters of the Saturnian gravitational field like the even zonal harmonics Jl are larger than the relativistic down-track shifts by about one order of magnitude, mainly for the inner satellites like Mimas, Enceladus, Thetys, Dione, Rhea, Titan and Hyperion. Iapetus and Phoebe are not sensibly affected by such kind of perturbations. Moreover, the bias due to the uncertainty in Saturn's GM is larger than the relativistic down-track effects for all such moons. Proposed linear combinations of the satellites' orbital elements would allow to cancel out the impact of the mismodelling in the low-degree even zonal harmonics and GM, but the combined down-track errors would be larger than the combined relativistic signature.

40|$|General {{relativity}} {{has been}} widely tested in weak gravitational fields but still stands largely untested in the strong-field regime. According to the no-hair theorem, black holes in general relativity depend only on their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. Mass and spin are the first two multipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all higher-order moments. The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be tested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such higher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for precision tests of general relativity with several experiments across the electromagnetic spectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A* with current and new instruments is expected to resolve their <b>orbital</b> <b>precessions.</b> Second, timing observations of radio pulsars near the Galactic center may detect characteristic residuals induced by the spin and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*.

We further inspect whether the spin of a "hot Jupiter" could have been trapped and maintained in a Cassini state during its early despinning and migration. We estimate the capture probability in a spin-orbit resonance between ∼ 0. 5 AU (a distance where tidal effects become significant) and 0. 05 AU {{for a wide range}} of secular orbital frequencies and amplitudes of gravitational perturbations. Numerical simulations of the spin evolution are performed to explore the influence of tidal despinning and migration processes on the resonance stability. We find that tidal heating within a non-synchronous giant planet is about twice larger than previous estimates based on the hypothesis of synchronization. Chances of capture in a spin-orbit resonance are very good around 0. 5 AU but they decrease dramatically with the semi-major axis. Furthermore, even if captured, both tidal despinning and migration processes cause the tidal torque to become large enough that the obliquity ultimately leaves the resonance and switches to near 0 ^∘. Locking a "hot Jupiter" in an isolated spin-orbit resonance is unlikely at 0. 05 AU but could be possible at larger distances.
