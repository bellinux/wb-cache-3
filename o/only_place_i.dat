500|$|In January 2008, Hamasaki {{announced}} on her blog that an inoperable condition, possibly tinnitus or Ménière's disease, had caused complete deafness {{in her left}} ear. She {{had been diagnosed with}} the condition in 2006 and that the problem dated to 2000, when she developed an ear infection but continued to perform against the advice of doctors. Despite the setback, Hamasaki stated that she wished to continue singing, and that [...] "as a professional", she wanted to [...] "deliver the best performance for everyone". On May 20, 2017, she wrote that she is also losing hearing in her right ear, and had experienced dizziness and nausea. She vowed to continue performing, writing: [...] "The stage is where I belong. It's the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> really, truly exist. I don't know anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Early 20th-century biographer André Maurois {{argues that}} [...] "what Byron {{was capable of}} loving in another was {{a certain kind of}} innocence and youthfulness" [...] and that the {{relationship}} was one of Byron's [...] "protective passions". Likewise, G. Wilson Knight, in his 1953 biography of Byron, believes that Byron became protective over Giraud just as he did with all of the children he met during his travels. Giraud was special to Byron, and, according to Knight, [...] "it was probably of Nicolo that he was thinking when he wrote that Greece was 'the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> was ever contented in. In Byron: A Biography, published in 1957, Marchand points out that Byron [...] "wished Hobhouse there to share the nonsensical gaiety" [...] of when Byron and Giraud were together, but changed his mind after remembering that Hobhouse's personality would not be conducive to entertainment. Their time together [...] "was a relaxed pleasure that [...] was to remember more fondly than most of the adventures of his travels".|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London I was looking for a job, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{different}} ways of thinking," [...] said his father. [...] "Church was the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> COULD have gone that St. Barnabas' Day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I must go; but I don't {{know how}} to tear myself from the sight of you. I feel as if I was driven from the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> ever might be good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allah," [...] he cried, [...] "thou seest what I got; [...] Thy {{servants}} bar me {{from the}} sacred spot." [...] "Be comforted," [...] the Holy One replied; [...] "It is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> am not." ...|$|R
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon we're {{two of a}} kind," [...] he said. [...] "It was a {{woman who}} drove me into the desert. But I come to remember. The desert's the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> can do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be fine, Dave! I {{would like}} to match some ribbon, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> can do {{it is in the}} French Shop in Coburntown;" [...] and thus {{speaking}} Laura Porter hurried out of the room {{to get ready for the}} sleigh-ride.|$|E
6000|$|... "Belarab's the man {{for this}} job. His is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> can look for help, but I don't think I know enough to find it. I wish I had old Jorgenson here--just for ten minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight in {{the middle}} of the Big River," [...] replied Mrs. Quack. [...] "It was the <b>only</b> safe <b>place.</b> <b>I</b> didn't dare go near either shore, and I'm nearly starved. I haven't had a mouthful to eat to-day." ...|$|R
2500|$|The earlier {{black and}} white episodes used the theme song [...] "Out of Town" [...] by Leslie Bricusse and Robin Beaumont, {{performed}} by Max Bygraves. The lyrics begin: [...] "Say what you will, the countryside is still, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> that <b>I</b> can settle down".|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{sister is}} always resorting to watering-places. My nieces {{do nothing but}} play on the piano. No, I shall perhaps go off to America, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have not seen yet, and I more than half engaged to go and help at Poonshedagore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I am sure I shall like Thrums, {{though those}} teas to the {{congregation}} {{are a little}} trying. Do you know, Thrums is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> was ever in where {{it struck me that}} the men are cleverer than the women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rooney's," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{softened}} at once by his amends, [...] "is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> know where a lady can smoke. Maybe it ain't a nice habit, but aunty lets us at home. And my name ain't Maudy, if you please; it's Ruby Delamere." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{see nothing}} {{of you in}} the papers, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> don't wish to see you; but you will be in town in the Winter. What dost thou do? shoot, hunt, and [...] "wind up y'e Clock" [...] as Caleb Quotem says? [1] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} a {{young lady}} reason," [...] said Rachel, bluntly. [...] "I want to {{understand}} the principle of diffused education, as there practised. The <b>only</b> other <b>places</b> <b>I</b> should really care to see are the Grand Reformatory for the Destitute in Holland, and the Hospital for Cretins in Switzerland." ...|$|R
5000|$|Newman {{was also}} {{asked if it}} was hard to write the lyrics about love and break-up, he said, [...] "No, it's the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> really open up to somebody, through my music. I'm {{producing}} album and writing it, it's good. I like to keep a hold of everything".|$|R
6000|$|... "Your age {{has nothing}} to do with it," [...] I retorted. [...] "It is because Stillwater is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have to run wild in ... and running wild is all I'm fit for. It's so lovely and roomy I can lose myself in it. I shall die or go mad if I'm cooped up on our little pocket {{handkerchief}} of a lawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--why, Captain Rule, I'm nat'rally economical. That {{would be}} wasteful, and waste I set {{down for a}} sin. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> {{calculate}} on throwing the shot, is into the face and eyes of the English. For my part, I wish Nelson himself {{was in one of}} them boats--I wish the man no harm; but I do wish he was in one of them very boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said, [...] "I {{have been}} in rooms at a {{farmhouse}} there, Caynsard's farm. I went away because I {{did not like the}} life here, and because my stepmother," [...] she continued, turning toward the Count, [...] "seemed determined that I should marry you. I thought that I would go away into the country, somewhere where I could think quietly. I went to Salthouse because it was the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> knew." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking at the National Press Club to mark his retirement, CBS {{commentator}} Eric Sevareid {{called the}} club the [...] "sanctum sanctorum of American journalists" [...] and said [...] "It's the Westminster Hall, it's Delphi, it's Mecca, the Wailing Wall {{for everybody in}} this country having {{anything to do with}} the news business; the <b>only</b> hallowed <b>place</b> <b>I</b> know of that's absolutely bursting with irreverence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bernal is not double jointed, {{a popular}} misconception. He says:"I’m not double-jointed at all. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> am double-jointed is my thumbs, which doesn’t even matter. I would say I’m {{probably}} a little more flexible than most people in certain areas, mainly my shoulders and my ankles, but I wasn’t born that way. Those areas became flexible because of years of practicing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was born}} with me, Roddy, and I can't help it. Life would be easier if I could. I was made to be my own master, and there's <b>only</b> one <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> can hope to be so." ...|$|R
60|$|Avalon is {{so clean}} and sweet. It is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have been, except Long Key, where the omnipresent, hateful, and stinking {{automobile}} does not obtrude upon real content. Think of air not reeking with gasolene and a street safe to cross at any time! Safe, I mean, of course, from being run down by some joy-rider. You {{are liable to}} encounter one of the Loreleis or Aphrodites at any hour from five till sunset. You must risk chance of that.|$|E
60|$|My old army {{experience}} I found indeed of {{very great}} service. I was no clerk, nor had I any capacity to become one. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> ever found {{in my life}} to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side coat-pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful than myself. But I had been quartermaster, commissary and adjutant in the field. The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how they should be made out. There was a clerk {{in the office of the}} Adjutant-General who supplied my deficiencies. The ease with which the State of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the close of the war is evidence of the efficiency of Mr. Loomis as an accountant on a large scale. He remained in the office until that time.|$|E
60|$|After three {{trips to}} Marsh Pass and Kayenta with my old guide, Al Doyle of Flagstaff, I finally {{succeeded in getting}} Wetherill to take me in to Nonnezoshe. This was {{in the spring of}} 1913 and my party was the second one, not scientific, to make the trip. Later this same year Wetherill took in the Roosevelt party and after that the Kolb brothers. It is a safe thing to say that this trip {{is one of the most}} {{beautiful}} in the West. It is a hard one and not for everybody. There is no guide except Wetherill, who knows how to get there. And after Doyle and I came out we admitted that we would not care to try to return over our back trail. We doubted if we could find the way. This is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have ever visited which I am not sure I could find again alone.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rummage and Loss" [...] (1977), {{short story}} by David Black {{published}} in Harper's Magazine. In the story, Black reminisces about Jacques-Louis David's neoclassical painting of Homer Reciting his Verses to the Greeks: The <b>only</b> other <b>place</b> <b>I</b> had seen people in togas before was in Flash Gordon movies ... the scene {{struck me as}} classic science fiction: an elder of Betelgeuse warns the cosmic council about {{the invasion of the}} Centauri locust-gods. (myth) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{cleanliness}} {{and decency}} quite out of keeping with democratic views? I'm fond of swimming, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> {{can get into}} the river now is the big pool beside the Thorndale road. It's a trifle public even at seven A. M., but my landlady objects to my bathing here, and since I can't afford the necessary apparatus I don't blame her. She says it brings the plaster off the lower ceilings, and I really think it does." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was in my}} {{old place}} at the Coliseum this morning, {{and it was as}} grand as ever. With that {{exception}} the ruined part of Rome--the real original Rome--looks smaller than my remembrance made it. It is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> on which <b>I</b> have yet found that effect. We are in the old hotel.|$|R
60|$|I CREPT {{to their}} doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped {{through a crack}} of the dining-room door, and see the men that was {{watching}} the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, {{and there was a}} candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.|$|E
60|$|I {{was tired}} and sleepy; but Coombs evidently {{intended}} to get {{the value of his}} seven-fifty out of me--he had a way of exacting the utmost farthing--and after feeding the horse, liberally, I carried fourteen buckets of water to fill a tank from the well before at last supper was ready. We ate it together silently in a long match-boarded room--Coombs, his wife, Marvin the big Manitoban hired man, and a curly-haired brown-eyed stripling with a look of good breeding about him. Mrs. Coombs was thin and angular, with a pink-tipped nose; and in their dwelling--the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> ever saw it on the prairie--she and her husband always sat with several feet of blank table between themselves and those who worked for them. They were also, I thought, representatives of an unpleasant type--the petty professional or suddenly promoted clerk, who, lacking equally the operative's sturdiness and the polish of those born in a higher station, apes the latter, and, sacrificing everything for appearance, becomes a poor burlesque on humanity. Even here, on the lone, wide prairie, they could not shake off the small pretense of superiority. When supper was finished--and Coombs' suppers were the worst I ever ate in Canada--the working contingent adjourned after washing dishes to the sod stable, where I asked questions about our employer.|$|E
5000|$|The song is an uptempo country-rocker, {{in which}} the narrator sings about the heartland of America - [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> feel at home" [...] and [...] "Where they still know wrong from right." ...|$|E
5000|$|John McCready, {{the head}} of CBS Records in New Zealand said [...] "I thought she was just fantastic and was {{surprised}} that her wonderful song and performance only got her <b>only</b> 3rd <b>place.</b> <b>I</b> was sure I had come across an artist who would be worth signing as our CBS New Zealand’s first local artist." [...] McCready discovered Dick La Forte, a Radio New Zealand music producer had completed an album with Sharon, adding [...] "I negotiated an agreement with all concerned parties to release the album on CBS." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "SIR: I have {{to report}} that I have for the last {{fortnight}} been [...] engaged in driving about the country in accordance with Miss [...] Covington's instructions. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where <b>I</b> can ascertain that [...] the pony and cart from Tilbury was noticed about that time was at [...] Stanford. My inquiries there before had failed, but after dining at [...] the inn, I {{went out into the}} yard behind, and asked the helper [...] whether the same trap that I drove over in from Tilbury had been [...] there since.|$|R
