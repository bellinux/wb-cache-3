5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} convincing {{confirmation}} {{comes from the}} inflection of the perfect: a Sanskrit root like sad- [...] "sit" [...] has sasada for [...] "I sat" [...] and sasāda for [...] "he, she, it sat".

That is, dadarśa [...] "saw" [...] is both first- and third-person singular, but a form like ˣdadārśa would have been allowed by Sanskrit syllable structure. The mystery was solved when the ending of the perfect in the first person singular was reanalyzed, on the basis of Hittite evidence as *-h₂e, beginning with an a-colouring laryngeal.

40|$|Injury to an {{immature}} {{permanent tooth}} {{may result in}} cessation of dentine deposition and root maturation leaving an <b>open</b> <b>root</b> apex and thin dentinal walls that are prone to fracture. Endodontic treatment is often complicated and protracted with an uncertain prognosis frequently resulting in premature tooth loss. Postnatal stem cells, which are capable of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation into multiple specialized cell lineages have been isolated and identified within the dental pulp, apical papilla and periodontal ligament. The ability of these cells to produce pulp-dentine and cementum-periodontal ligament complexes in vivo suggest potential applications involving stem cells, growth factors and scaffolds for apexification or apexogenesis. Similar protein expression amongst dental stem cells possibly implicates a common origin; however, the dominant cells to repopulate an open apex will be directed by local environmental cues. A {{greater understanding of the}} structure and function of cells within their environment is necessary to regulate and facilitate cellular differentiation along a certain developmental path with subsequent tissue regeneration. This review focuses on development of the apical tissues, dental stem cells and their possible involvement clinically in closing the <b>open</b> <b>root</b> apex. MEDLINE and EMBASE computer databases were searched up to January 2009. Abstracts of all potentially relevant articles were scanned and their contents identified before retrieval of full articles. A manual search of article reference lists as well as a forward search on selected authors of these articles was undertaken. It appears that dental stem cells have the potential for continued cell division and regeneration to replace dental tissues lost through trauma or disease. Clinical applications using these cells for apexogenesis and apexification will be dependent on a greater understanding of the environment at the immature root end and what stimulates dental stem cells to begin dividing and then express a certain phenotype.

As a result, it has improved the previously low success rates of root-end sealing, root canal filling, and perforation sealing in difficult cases. Root-end sealing of resected surfaces using 4 -META/MMA-TBB during apicoectomy and intentional replantation prevents leakage from root canal and root resorption. 4 -META/MMA-TBB can offer sealing for <b>root</b> canals with <b>opened</b> <b>root</b> apex in which pressure could not be applied during root canal filling.

40|$|Abstract Background The root apical {{meristem}} of crop and model legume Medicago truncatula is a significantly different stem cell system {{to that of}} the widely studied model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study we used the Affymetrix Medicago GeneChip ® to compare the transcriptomes of meristem and non-meristematic root to identify root meristem specific candidate genes. Results Using mRNA from root meristem and non-meristem we were able to identify 324 and 363 transcripts differentially expressed from the two regions. With bioinformatics tools developed to functionally annotate the Medicago genome array we could identify significant changes in metabolism, signalling and the differentially expression of 55 transcription factors in meristematic and non-meristematic roots. Conclusion This is the first comprehensive analysis of M. truncatula root meristem cells using this genome array. This data will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks involved in the <b>open</b> <b>root</b> meristem of M. truncatula and provides candidates for functional analysis. </p...|$|E

30|$|These results led us {{to assume}} that the wide root cone angle trait could be {{controlled}} by different mutations in the J 4 and J 6 subpopulations. It was not possible to test this hypothesis with J 4 since all alleles specific to the subpopulation would have appeared associated with the mutation. However, it was possible to avoid structural problems with J 6, since J 6 was composed of only accessions of the two tails of the distribution. The same approach as above was therefore applied to J 6. The allele frequency among the three accessions of J 6 with <b>open</b> <b>root</b> angles was compared to the allele frequency among the 7 accessions with narrow root angles. Because of the very small size of the sample, only the extreme situation (one allele present in one group and absent in the other or vice versa) was considered. This time, 367 and 132 markers distributed in cluster on different chromosomes were found discriminant within J 6 for the variant and the reference alleles, respectively. However, all these markers segregated {{in the rest of the}} population, with at best a ratio of 2 accessions with the reference or variant alleles compared with 155 with the complementary one.|$|E
30|$|To {{identify}} the loci {{responsible for the}} very wide root cone angle, assuming that this trait can be controlled by a major gene, we tested other approaches using only the GBS dataset since phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 10 of the extreme accessions compared with only 8 in the HDRA dataset. First, we looked at markers that were discriminant between the 10 accessions with an <b>open</b> <b>root</b> cone angle {{and the rest of}} the panel (157 accessions). Marker S 06 _ 21, 685, 315, corresponding to qj 06 _ 02 was found to be the one that discriminated the best the two phenotypic groups. The variant allele present in the 10 accessions with a wide root cone angle was present in only four accessions of the rest of the panel. However, these four accessions included Ketan Lumbu (bulu) and Padi Kasale (close to bulus), which had wide root cone angles (close to 100 °), as well as NPE 253 and NPE 826 (temperate japonica) from Pakistan, which had narrow angles (approximately 50 °). In contrast, when the reference allele was present in the 10 accessions, no marker was found discriminant with at best a ratio of 7 accessions with the reference allele compared with 150 accessions with the variant allele in the rest of the panel.|$|E
40|$|Myotragus balearicus Bate 1909 is an {{artiodactyl}} Caprinae {{endemic to}} the Balearic Islands (Spain), which became extinct more than 4000 years ago. It {{is characterized by}} a series of very unusual apomorphies acquired throughout its insular evolution, one of which is the presence of a single evergrowing incisor (with an <b>open</b> <b>root)</b> in each dentary. This incisor has been classically considered as I. The study of recently discovered fossils of this species, which have been collected from the excavation of Holocene cave sediments in Cova Estreta (Pollença, Mallorca) and in Cova des Moro (Manacor, Mallorca), together with the re-examination of materials belonging both to this species and to its ancestors, allowed us to study the ontogeny and evolution of the Myotragus dentition. The replacement of premolars differs only slightly from the pattern recorded in other bovids. Nevertheless, there are significant differences with other bovids regarding the incisiform series. Myotragus balearicus lacks secondary incisors. Through a neotenic process, which started during the Upper Pliocene, M. balearicus acquired a monophyodontic incisiform dentition, reducing the number of incisiforms to only one, identified as dI 2. The richness of the finds allows us to describe the different steps in this evolution. The only incisiform that appears to have been lost is dI 3. The identification of the evergrowing incisor of M. balearicus as dI 2 reinforces its convergence with rodents postulated by Bate and there is discussion regarding homologies of incisors of rodents and lagomorphs.
