40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study and {{understand}} the theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Design and Development Process and <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development Process followed by Automobile Manufacturing Companies in order to understand the similarities and differences between the theoretical model and practical process <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development. Key Concepts The main concepts reviewed in the paper are theoretical “Stage – Gate model” <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Design and Development, <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development Process followed in automobile industry, role of various departments in the <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development Process. Methodology The methodology used to review the concepts exposed in this paper was theoretical research. Conclusion Generic product development process as described by Ulriche & Eppinger sets up overall framework of the product development process but it does not describe the micro-level activities <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development process. Whereas the practical process <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development works out on very micro-level details of the task and activities in <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development process. Generic product development process is a simple framework and hence it is common for any organisation, but actual process <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> design and development is worked out to the very detail level according to functions in an organisation and hence it changes from product to product and organisation to organisation. ...|$|R

5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>products</b> during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E

The subject of research in the article is measuring the results of product innovation. The article is aimed at identifying the directions in terms of which the measuring of results is to be considered. Our goal is to shed light on the different points of view thereon. The need of measuring results <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development is justified. It is shown that each determinant of product innovation performance serves three functions: of a goal; of an indicator and of grounds for personnel motivation. It is proved that, albeit different, the said three functions are interrelated. The article defines the difficulties in measuring the results <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development. It is proved that the main difficulties in measuring results are related to their use by a broad circle of managers, to the intangible nature <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development performance, to the fact that product innovation is related to nonstandard and extraordinary tasks and the development <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> <b>product</b> is related to both insecurity and the organizational complexity and of lack of concentration on the <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development activities. A system of indicators for measuring the results <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development where different indicators are used at each company level is proposed. There are three levels of measurement using their relevant indicators: level <b>of</b> the separate <b>new</b> <b>product</b> project; level <b>of</b> the product innovation process and strategic level.
