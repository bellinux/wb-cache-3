Intrinsic AKI can {{be due to}} {{one or more of the}} kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium.

Other causes <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome.

Only very recently (2006) had extrinsic evaluations begun to provide some evidence for the value of WSD in end-user applications. Until 1990 or so, discussions of the sense disambiguation task focused mainly on illustrative examples rather than comprehensive evaluation. The early 1990s saw the beginnings of more systematic and rigorous intrinsic evaluations, including more formal experimentation on small sets of ambiguous words.|$|E

In this case the change of x1 is current-controlled (spin torque {{is due to a}} high current density) whereas the change of x2 is voltage-controlled (the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields).

The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form mollis, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.|$|E
25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>intrinsic</b> or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|E

40|$|Empirical mode {{decomposition}} can decompose {{a complicated}} signal into a sum <b>of</b> finite <b>intrinsic</b> mode functions whose instantaneous frequencies computed by the analytic signal method give a physically meaningful {{characterization of the}} signal. However, {{it is found that}} computing the instantaneous frequency <b>of</b> an <b>intrinsic</b> mode function through the Hilbert transform may produce some ridiculous results. Recently, an empirical AM/FM (amplitude and frequency modulation) demodulation for computing the instantaneous frequency <b>of</b> an <b>intrinsic</b> mode function has been proposed by Huang and his coworkers. This method totally eschews the Hilbert transform and can compute the instantaneous frequency <b>of</b> an <b>intrinsic</b> mode function very accurately. However, this paper will show that the empirical FM part extracted through the empirical AM/FM demodulation may contain riding waves and is no longer an intrinsic mode function. That will make the instantaneous frequency nonsensical. To overcome this drawback, an improved method, called riding wave turnover-empirical AM/FM demodulation, is proposed in this paper. Experiments show very positive results...|$|R
