5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer <b>oil</b> <b>regeneration</b> systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This article {{discusses}} the electrochemical method of directional conversion of carboxylic acids, {{which are the}} most aggressive hydrocarbons oxidation products back into the corresponding hydrocarbons. Existing methods for the regeneration of waste petroleum oils have significant drawbacks, which include the formation of new hard-reclaimed waste and loss of {{a significant part of}} the <b>oil</b> during <b>regeneration.</b> Methods: Electrooxidation processes of carboxylic acid on various electrode materials: platinum, graphite and shungite anodes were studied. Results: Potentiostatic polarization curves with simultaneous measurement of near-electrode solution pH showed differences in the process on these anode materials: dimer yield for Kolbe is decreased under the transition from platinum to shungite. At potentials higher than 2. 0 v, carboxylic acid has a higher adsorbability compared to water. Therefore Faraday’s side-process of water oxidation doesn’t almost occur, which contributes to high yield of expected product according to current. Electrolysis of carboxylic acids solutions under controlled potential (2. 0 and 2. 4 V) and chromatographic analysis of the formed products showed that along with the dimeric structures formation for Kolbe reaction, the occurrence of a hydrocarbons mixture takes place, which may be the result of disproportionation of hydrocarbon radicals (alkane and alkene) and hydrocarbons of isomeric structure, by further oxidation of the hydrocarbon radical to carbocation and its subsequent transformation into the corresponding saturated and unsaturated isomers. Such statement is not supported by conception of the process of one- and two-electron carboxylic acid oxidation. Discussion: General carboxylic acid oxidation scheme according to one-electron mechanism (dimerization and disproportionation of the radical) and two-electron mechanism (formation and carbocation rearrangement) is proposed. The formation of hydrocarbons under carboxylic acid electrooxidation of waste <b>oils</b> during their <b>regeneration</b> can promote the increase of oil yield without formation of dangerous by-products. </p...|$|R

According to the results, this method was proved to be effective to the narrow separation of the material of waste engine oil from engine maintenance workshop, and also be suitable to a large-scale production. The properties of the distillation products from molecular distillation were found to be comparable with those of the typical standards of MVI 250 and MVI 350 respectively. The overall yield of 90 % was got in the process. The recommended conditions of the pabs was 5 - 80 pa, heat transfer oils was 200 - 240 o C, circulating water temperature is 25 - 28 o C.

40|$|The Diels-Alder {{approach}} to the synthesis of rosmariquinone (RQ) and RQ derivatives had yields between 35 and 90 %. The highest yielding derivatives were those in which an ortho-substituted catechol (eg. 3 -isopropyl catechol) {{was used as a}} starting material while the lowest yielding were those where no ortho-substitution was present (eg. 4 -methyl catechol). Ring A alterations had a slight influence (5 to 10 % loss) in the reaction yield. Antioxidant (AO) activity was also influenced by both ring A and C alterations. Best activity was found in the derivatives containing a carbon- 13 (C- 13) methyl or hydrogen substitution. The worst activity was found in the unsubstituted A ring (normilitrone). The difference in the activity was associated with the ability of normilitrone to rearrange during the initial oxidation to a C- 4 /C- 5 unsaturated intermediate while RQ, a structure identical to normilitrone except that the C- 4 contains two methyl substitutions, can only rearrange to a C- 1 /C- 10 intermediate which is the favored intermediate. Because the C- 1 /C- 10 intermediate was formed in lower amounts, the normilitrone AO activity was also reduced since the C- 1 /C- 10 intermediate was needed to produce-secondary intermediates such as hydroxymilitrone. Hydroxymilitrone was converted in a two step rearrangement process to form the active RQ species, acrucadiol (also labeled miltiodiol). The active species can then act as a hydrogen donor and effectively inhibit the oxidation of stripped soybean oil as well as methyl oleate in photo- and autoxidation. Hydrogen donor activity was also demonstrated by the synergistic activity between RQ and tocopherol. The mechanism is one that RQ, after converting to arucadiol, donates hydrogen to the tocopheroxyl radical formed during the oxidation of the soybean <b>oil.</b> The <b>regeneration</b> of the tocopherol {{can be explained by the}} evidence that RQ concentration greatly decreased during the study while maintaining the tocopherol levels. From this study, the RQ antioxidant activity has been elucidated and essential structural features identified. ...|$|R

More precisely gaseous, liquid and solid effluents from processes are analysed qualitativelyand quantitatively when possible. Techniques to treat these effluents are reviewed or proposedwhen lacking and methods to {{do not produce}} these effluents are envisaged. In the part A of the report general effluents that are released from all types of processes arestudied. These effluents include fugitive emissions, flue gases from process heaters,blowdown systems emissions and wastewaters. Fugitive emissions, one of the greatestsources of VOCs can be qualified and quantified by the average emission factor approach andreduced thanks {{to the implementation of}} an LDAR program. Flue gases from process heaters,which are a major source of NOx, SOx and particulate matters can be characterized withemission factors and several techniques exist to treat or prevent these emissions. Concerningblowdown systems emissions, which are difficult to quantify, methods to minimize theseemissions are given. Finally, wastewaters treatment in petroleum industry is shortly describedbefore best management practices and pollution prevention methods are enounced. In the part B of the report four families of processes are studied: naphtha hydrotreatment,naphtha isomerization, catalytic reforming and hydrogenation in olefin plants.

40|$|Biological {{regeneration}} {{of water}} and organic sorbents used in the absorption of hydrophilic and hydrophobic pollutants, respectively, was studied. In both cases biodegradation {{takes place in a}} membrane bioreactor. In the case of organic sorbents regeneration of the biodegradation process is integrated with the extraction of a given pollutant to water phase. In experiments carried out in this work, the proposed systems were tested using a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. For hydrophilic compounds experiments were performed using alcohols (1 -butanol and 2 -propanol) as model substrates. Applying the mathematical model of a membrane bioreactor elaborated previously, the values of pollutant concentration were determined and positively verified in the experiments.

40|$|Israel {{produces}} ∼ 1. 3 Mt/year of fly ash (FA), {{a byproduct}} of its coal-fired power plants. Due to increasing environmental regulations, these imported coals are processed to reduce the sulfur concentration (∼ 0. 6 %). These processing methods result in a material that has an enriched alkali/alkali earth component with pozzolanic and basic properties (pH > 10. 5). FAs are utilized worldwide, mainly as a cement additive for the construction industry. Recently, it was demonstrated that Class F FA can act as an excellent fixation reagent for acidic wastes from the phosphate or the <b>oil</b> <b>regeneration</b> industries. In the current work the potential utilization of Class F FAs as fixation reagents for low-activity radioactive waste from the nuclear industry was examined. Aqueous solutions containing radionuclide simulants: cesium (Cs+), strontium, (Sr 2 +), and cerium (Ce 3 +, Ce 4 +) were used as case studies with promising results. It is suggested that the primary fixation mechanism involves the aluminate/silicate anions at the FA surface. A novel experimental fixation approach utilizing the formation of carbonates is demonstrated and a new interaction mechanism is suggested based on the electrostatic interactions of the positively charged fine precipitates with the negatively charged FA surface. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify the importance of seed banks to re-establishment of vegetation, soil cores (N = 210) were extracted from a freshwater wetland near Dulac, LA and exposed to sweet or sour crude oil, diesel fuel, or tap water. Oils were applied to cores at 2 or 8 L m- 2. The seed bank contained a relatively high density of seeds (ca. 4000 seedlings m- 2) encompassing 24 different species. The application of 2 L m- 2 of oil, regardless of type, did not affect seedling emergence. Diesel fuel and sour crude oil applied at 8 L m- 2 reduced seedling emergence by 50 %.
