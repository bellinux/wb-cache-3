The study was commissioned in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> transport alternatives for neighborhoods along New York City's shores. It also discussed the East River Ferry, which was set to enter service later that year.

5|$|The early {{models for}} the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the {{exclusive}} Print Room at the British Museum {{in the company of}} Richard Aldington and the curator and poet Laurence Binyon in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> Nishiki-e prints that incorporated traditional Japanese verse. However, she also derived her way of making poems from her reading of Classical Greek literature and especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), a translation of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose translation of Ion.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E

For one, research has shown that if each employee has their performance individually measured, they will put in more effort than if it was not measured. Another person interested in the idea of social loafing is Kenneth Price, from The University of Texas. Price conducted a social loafing experiment in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> whether two key factors that he suspected {{played a role in the}} way social loafing arose in work groups.

The experiments findings did in fact corroborate Price's suspicions in the two factors of dispensability and fairness.|$|E

The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the fundus and gastroesophageal junction.
