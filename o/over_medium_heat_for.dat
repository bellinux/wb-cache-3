Par-boil both the smoked ham and the fresh ham shank in a stockpot with five {{cups of water}} on medium heat. Skim off any scum forming {{on top of the}} liquid. Cook for about 20 minutes. Remove the meat and put in a large Chinese clay pot. Strain the liquid from par-boiling through a fine sieve and pour into the clay pot. Or you can discard the liquid and use fresh water instead.Peel off the tough outer leaves from the bamboo shoots. The simplest way to accomplish this is to cut the shoot lengthwise into halves and then remove the leaves. Par-boil the bamboo shoots in a stockpot with about four cups of water <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> <b>for</b> about 5 minutes. Drain the shoots and let cool. Slice the shoots very thinly crosswise when cool. Put the bamboo shoot slices into the clay pot.|$|E

2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|R

It is important both not to overheat the empty pressure cooker and never to heat the empty cooker with the lid and gasket in place. Overheating can cause warping and other damage.

50|$|To make bap, rice is {{scrubbed}} {{in water}} and rinsed several times. This process produces tteumul (water from the last washing of rice). It is then soaked for thirty minutes before boiling, which helps the grains cook evenly.

Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.)

40|$|Electroconsolidation{reg_sign} is a {{proprietary}} process for rapid, pressure-assisted densification of powder preforms.

40|$|Effective exhaust hoods can {{mitigate}} the {{indoor air quality}} impacts of pollutant emissions from residential cooking. This study reports capture efficiencies (CE) measured for cooking generated particles for scripted cooking procedures in a 121 -m 3 chamber with kitchenette. CEs also were measured for burner produced CO 2 during cooking and separately for pots and pans containing water. The study used four exhaust hoods previously tested by Delp and Singer (Environ. Sci. Technol., 2012, 46, 6167 - 6173). For pan-frying a hamburger <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> on the back burner, CEs for particles {{were similar to those}} for burner produced CO 2 and mostly above 80 percent. For stir-frying green beans in a wok (high heat, front burner), CEs for burner CO 2 during cooking varied by hood and airflow: CEs were 34 - 38 percent for low (51 ? 68 L s- 1) and 54 ? 72 percent for high (109 ? 138 L s- 1) settings. CEs for 0. 3 ? 2. 0 ?m particles during front burner stir-frying were 3 ? 11 percent on low and 16 ? 70 percent on high settings. Results indicate that CEs measured for burner CO 2 are not predictive of CEs of cooking-generated particles under all conditions, but they may be suitable to identify devices with CEs above 80 percent both for burner combustion products and for cooking-related particles...|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling {{for the use of}} vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or cooking spray {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked <b>over</b> light to <b>medium</b> <b>heat,</b> it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R
40|$|Process for {{quantitative}} and qualitative on-line differentiation of biotic and abiotic particles in a gaseous medium is claimed. The number and size of particles is determined in a first measuring device and then the <b>medium</b> is <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> a short time to above 100 deg. C. The measurements are then repeated in a second measuring device. The number and size of biotic and abiotic particles is then determined based on the two results. Preferably the <b>medium</b> is <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> {{a few seconds to}} above 200 deg. C especially above 400 deg. C. In addition to the particle size distribution, other physical parameters e. g. the refractive index of the particles are determined simultaneously e. g. by light scattering. USE - Method is useful for assessing particulate contamination in gaseous media especially where the production environment {{plays an important role in}} determining the product quality. Such measurements are useful in medicines, foods, biotechnology, in health service work and in monitoring maxim um allowable concentrations in the workplace. The biotic particles may be alive or dead and include microorganisms (such as fungi or bacteria), their fragments, skin flakes, production residues, or plant spores as well as hair, sweat or skin fats.
