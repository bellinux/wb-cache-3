5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, {{and they may have}} grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{research}} on individuals in such environments {{has been conducted}} since the 1980s. Responding to social and psychological issues recorded in military families and communities, the U.S. Armed Forces sponsored {{research on}} the long-term impact <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> as a military dependent. Outside of the U.S. {{there is no significant}} literature on the effects <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> as a military dependent. Since the Department of Defense does not track or monitor former brats, any study on adult brats is based upon self-identification. Thus, even though the studies are performed using scientific sampling methods, they may contain bias because of the difficulty in conducting epidemiological studies across broad-based population samples. Some researchers used referrals, the Internet, and newspaper articles to identify military brats.|$|E
