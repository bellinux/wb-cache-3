2500|$|He is {{best remembered}} as Trooper Gilmore, a popular super heavyweight [...] "fan favorite", {{in both the}} {{original}} Century Wrestling Alliance and NWA New England {{where he was a}} main rival of [...] "heel" [...] wrestler Tony Rumble. He also won the NWA New England Tag Team Championship with The Outpatient as Criminally Insane and Corporal Robinson as 5-0. He was an ally of MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas during their feud with <b>Ox</b> Baker's MWF <b>stable</b> <b>Ox's</b> Army and, in NWW, twice won the promotion's tag team titles with Jimmy [...] "Jact" [...] Cash and Brutus [...] "the Barber" [...] Beefcake.

2500|$|In 2005, Allen {{debuted in}} the Millennium Wrestling Federation with manager Bull Montana and allied himself with MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in their feud with <b>Ox</b> Baker's <b>stable</b> <b>Ox</b> Baker's Army (The Outpatient, Pierre [...] "The Beast" [...] Vachon & The Islanders). He also soon found himself {{subject to a}} kayfabe vendetta by MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson who would force him to wrestle {{increasing}} difficult opponents and stipulations. At the Road to the Gold supercard, Allen lost to The Outpatient and, the following month at Halloween Horror, had to wrestle The Islanders in handicap match. Allen joined Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in an 8-man tag team match with The Sandman to defeat Ox Baker's Army at the Soul Survivor III supercard in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 5, 2005. This effectively ended the near 2-year feud between Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas and Ox Baker. Manager Johnny Fabulous also made his debut in this match and would appear with Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas {{for the next few}} months. Allen was later named as a suspect when Dr. Von Johnson was assaulted by an unknown assailant while leaving the Braintree Moose Lodge after an MWF event.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes-prone BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) rats {{received}} thrice weekly {{injections of}} mAb against antigens expressed {{on the surface}} of all T cells (OX 19), cytotoxic/suppressor, and NK cells (OX 8), helper/inducer cells (W 3 / 25, OX 35, OX 38), and Ia+ cells (OX 6, 3 JP, OX 17). Treatment with OX 8 or <b>OX</b> 19 achieved <b>stable</b> reductions of splenic and peripheral blood NK cells and helper/inducer T lymphocytes, respectively, and protected against diabetes. OX 19 injections also prevented lymphocytic insulitis, thyroiditis, and the synthesis of autoantibodies to thyroid colloid and smooth muscle antigens. OX 8 injections reduced splenic NK-mediated YAC- 1 cell lysis, but did not prevent insulitis, thyroiditis, or autoantibody synthesis. Injections of mAb specific for antigens {{on the surface of}} helper/inducer cells, and for cells expressing IaE antigens provided marginal protection against diabetes without reductions of phenotypic subsets. These findings suggest that pancreatic beta cell destruction in the spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor rat is mediated by the combined action of NK and helper/inducer cells...|$|R
2500|$|In late-2003, Ferraro {{joined the}} Millennium Wrestling Federation. He was {{originally}} {{brought in by}} MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson to take out Ralph Lano but later turned against him. At MWF's [...] "Soul Survivor", he and Slyk Wagner Brown attacked Todd Hanson following his victory over D-Lo Brown, also cutting his hair and throwing it at Hanson's family members seated at ringside. Embarrassing Hanson {{in front of his}} hometown, their actions began a heated year-long feud between the two wrestlers. Later on in the show, in which Ferraro was scheduled to have a championship match, MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson [...] "screwed" [...] him by ordering a gauntlet match instead. Ferraro defeated three other wrestlers to get to Todd Hanson and battled to a double-countout. He was later recruited by Ox Baker to join his <b>stable,</b> <b>Ox</b> Baker's Army. While managed by Baker, he used a variation of Baker's infamous heart punch, using a headbutt rather than a punch, called the [...] "Baker Breaker". Soul Survivor 04' saw Ferraro team with Kamala the Ugandan Giant and The Executioner in a 6-man tag team match against Todd Hanson, Beau Douglas, and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton. When Hanson pinned the Executioner, Ferraro was blamed for the loss since he was the team captain. He started trading blows with Kamala and his former stablemates turned against him. Eventually, Todd Hanson and his team returned to the ring on Ferraro's behalf. The show ended with Ferraro shaking hands with his long-time rival.|$|R
40|$|The "living" and/or {{controlled}} cationic ring-opening bulk copolymerization of oxetane (Ox) with tetrahydropyran (THP) (cyclic ether with no homopolymerizability) at 35 °C {{was examined}} using ethoxymethyl- 1 -oxoniacyclohexane hexafluoroantimonate (EMOA) and (BF 3 · CH 3 OH) THP as fast and slow initiator, respectively, yielding living and nonliving polymers with pseudoperiodic sequences (i. e., each pentamethylene oxide fragment {{inserted into the}} polymer is flanked by two trimethylene oxide fragments). Good control over number-average molecular weight (Mn up to 150000 g mol- 1) with molecular weight distribution (MWD ∼ 1. 4 - 1, 5) broader than predicted by the Poison distribution (MWDs > 1 + 1 /DPn) was attained using EMOA as initiating system, i. e., C 2 H 5 OCH 2 Cl with 1. 1 equiv of AgSbF 6 as a stable catalyst and 1. 1 equiv of 2, 6 -di-tert-butylpyridine used as a non-nucleophilic proton trap. With (BF 3 · CH 3 OH) THP, a drift of the linear dependence M n(GPC) vs Mn(theory) to lower molecular weight was observed together with the production of cyclic oligomers, ∼ 3 - 5 % of the Ox consumed in THP against ∼ 30 % in dichloromethane. Structural and kinetics studies highlighted a mechanism of chains growth where the rate of mutual conversion between "strain ACE species" (chain terminated by a tertiary 1 -oxoniacyclobutane ion, Al) and "strain-free ACE species" (chain terminated by a tertiary 1 -oxoniacyclohexane ion, Tl) depends on {{the rate at which}} <b>Ox</b> converts the <b>stable</b> species T 1 (kind of "dormant" species) into a living "propagating" center A 1 (i. e., k aapp[Ox]). The role of the THP solvent associated with the suspension of irreversible and reversible transfer reactions to polymer, when the polymerization is initiated with EMOA, was predicted by our kinetic considerations. The activation -deactivation pseudoequilibrium coefficient (Qt) was then calculated in a pure theoretical basis. From the measured apparent rate constant of Ox (kOxapp) and THP (kTHPapp = ka(endo) app) consumption, Qt and reactivity ratio (kp/kd, k a(endo) /ka(exo), and ks/ka(endo) were calculated, which then allow the determination of the transition rate constant of elementary step reactions that governs the increase of Mu with conversion...|$|R

[...] The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the [...] Mississippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around; [...] California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume, [...] the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one [...] in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path; [...] Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving [...] mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks [...] and wharves; [...] Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with [...] equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride; [...] In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the [...] calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorsement, [...] The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward [...] the earth, [...] The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural [...] exclamations, [...] The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march, [...] The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter [...] of enemies; [...] All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, [...] reminiscences, institutions, [...] All these States compact, every square mile of these States without [...] excepting a particle; [...] Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields, [...] Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies [...] shuffling between each other, ascending high in the air, [...] The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler [...] southward but returning northward early in the spring, [...] The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows and [...] shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside, [...] The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New [...] Orleans, San Francisco, [...] The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan; [...] Evening--me in my room--the setting sun, [...] The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the [...] swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre [...] of the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift [...] shadows in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is; [...] The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners, [...] Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the [...] individuality of the States, each for itself--the moneymakers, [...] Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, [...] pulley, all certainties, [...] The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, [...] In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars--on the firm [...] earth, the lands, my lands, [...] O lands! all so dear to me--what you are, (whatever it is,) I putting it [...] at random in these songs, become a part of that, whatever it is, [...] Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the [...] myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida, [...] Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, [...] the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the [...] Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing [...] and skipping and running, [...] Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with [...] parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and [...] aquatic plants, [...] Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing [...] the crow with its bill, for amusement--and I triumphantly twittering, [...] The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh [...] themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside [...] move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to time [...] reliev'd by other sentinels--and I feeding and taking turns [...] with the rest, [...] In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters, [...] rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his [...] fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--and I, plunging at the [...] hunters, corner'd and desperate, [...] In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the [...] countless workmen working in the shops, [...] And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself [...] than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, [...] Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more [...] inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a thousand [...] diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands [...] are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY; [...] Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains, [...] Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these me, [...] These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me [...] and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the union [...] of them, to afford the like to you?
