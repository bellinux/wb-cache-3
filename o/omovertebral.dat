50|$|The scapula {{is small}} and rotated so that its {{inferior}} edge points toward the spine. There is a high correlation between Sprengel's deformity and the Klippel-Feil syndrome. Sometimes a bony connection is present between the elevated scapula {{and one of the}} cervical vertebrae, usually C5 or C6. This connection is known as the <b>omovertebral</b> bone.|$|E
50|$|Sprengel's {{deformity}} (also {{known as}} high scapula or congenital high scapula) {{is a rare}} congenital skeletal abnormality where a person has one shoulder blade that sits higher on the back than the other. The deformity {{is due to a}} failure in early fetal development where the shoulder fails to descend properly from the neck to its final position. The deformity is commonly associated with other conditions, most notably Klippel-Feil syndrome, congenital scoliosis including cervical scoliosis, fused ribs, the presence of an <b>omovertebral</b> bone and spina bifida. The left shoulder is the most commonly affected shoulder but the condition can be bilateral, meaning that both shoulders are affected. About 75% of all observed cases are girls. Treatment includes surgery in early childhood and physical therapy. Surgical treatment in adulthood is complicated by the risk of nerve damage when removing the <b>omovertebral</b> bone and when stretching the muscle tissue during relocation of the shoulder.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of Sprengel deformity, {{which is also}} called congenital high scapula, are malposition and dysplasia of the affected scapula, with possible <b>omovertebral</b> connection. The aim {{of the present study}} was mainly to present the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of two pediatric cases of Sprengel deformity. A 7 -year-old girl and a 9 -year-old boy with deformities in their right shoulder were studied. Plain radiographs were obtained. MRI was performed for both children. The fibrous <b>omovertebral</b> connection is depicted in its longest form in one plane. <b>Omovertebral</b> band is best screened in coronal and axial cross sections. We are introducing a new MRI sign which we named as "Ra′s eye" to define the appearance of <b>omovertebral</b> band within the surrounding fat tissue...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year-old boy {{was found}} to have an unusual {{presentation}} of the Sprengel anomaly, <b>omovertebral</b> bones, and segmentation defects of the vertebral column at the cervical, thoracic, and sacral level. In addition, he showed hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, webbing, and hypoplasia of the thenar and hypothenar areas. He had moderate mental delay. In addition to the segmentation defects and <b>omovertebral</b> bones, radiological studies showed a small pelvis and 11 pairs of ribs. Some of the features were present in the mother, and minimal symptoms were present in the father. The parents were consanguineous. A paternal cousin had segmentation defects, <b>omovertebral</b> bones, and a Sprengel deformity as well, although with milder presentation than the proband. We were unable to find a similar combination of manifestations in literature. The familial occurrence is best compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance, showing wide variability of expression. It is possible that the more notable signs in the proband can be explained by homozygosity for the disorder. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} series of four cases of {{congenital}} high scapula (or Sprengel's deformity) diagnosed and followed in our establishment. The main feature of this very rare congenital malformation of the pectoral girdle is an abnormally high, more or less dysmorphic scapula. A congenitally high scapula is often discovered in young children, when consequences for aesthetics, and sometimes functional difficulties, are brought to light. When surgical treatment is envisaged, imaging is recommended to diagnose a supernumerary structure, ossified (an <b>omovertebral</b> bone) or not (a fibrous and/or cartilaginous connection), extending from the scapula to the cervical spine. This needs to be resected. A CT scan is essential for detecting an <b>omovertebral</b> bone and the vertebral bone abnormalities that are often associated with it. MRI and ultrasound are very useful for assessing any fibrous and/or cartilaginous components. An ultrasound examination has the undeniable advantage of being quick and easy in these young children...|$|E
30|$|This {{refers to}} a dysmorphic, high-positioned scapula at birth that results from lack of normal caudal {{migration}} of the scapula during embryogenesis. The scapula often has a convex medial margin, concave lateral margin, decreased height to width ratio and associated hypoplasia of the scapular muscle [28]. CT can identify associated congenital scoliosis and <b>omovertebral</b> bars and help in surgical planning [28].|$|E
30|$|In our study, twelve {{patients}} (92.3 %) had associated congenital anomalies. Seven {{of these}} twelve patients {{had more than}} one associated abnormality. The only syndrome that was found in our cases was Klippel-Feil syndrome (15.38 %). None of the described syndromes in the literature could be found in our cases. A frequent anomaly associated with Sprengel’s deformity is the <b>omovertebral</b> connection, which could be fibrous band, cartilage, bone connection, or a combination of these. It connects the superomedial border of the scapula to the spinous process, lamina, or transverse processes of the cervical spine. It has been reported to be present in 18 – 60 % of patients with congenital elevation of the scapula [6, 12, 21]. In our group of patients, it occurred in 46.15 %% of the patients, had significant limitation in abduction of the involved shoulder, and excision of <b>omovertebral</b> bone improved the abduction in all cases. Surgery for Sprengel’s deformity can produce less lowering of the scapula than desired and occasionally can result in an injury to the brachial plexus or brachial artery [13].|$|E
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this article to {{describe}} an operative procedure for the correction of congenital elevation of the scapula. In this operation, lowering of the scapula is accomplished by release and transplantation of the origin of the muscles attached to the medial border of the scapula, combined with removal of the <b>omovertebral</b> bone and other limiting structures. To my knowledge the previously reported methods for the correction of this deformity have involved the release of the insertions of these muscles, rather than the origins. In this deformity, the scapula is elevated, hypoplastic, and usually somewhat adducted. Almost without exception, there are associated anomalies of the cervical and thoracic spine, as well as the ribs. An <b>omovertebral</b> bone is found to be present in approximately one-third of these deformities. This osseous and cartilaginous structure extends upward and medially from the upper margin of the scapula to attach by either cartilaginous or fibrous tissue to the spinous process, lamina, or transverse process of one of the lower cervical vertebrae. The abnormal bar, occasionally in combination with a contracted or fibrous levator scapulae muscle...|$|E
30|$|We {{report the}} results of fifteen cases of Sprengel’s {{deformity}} treated surgically by initial subperiosteal resection of the middle third of the clavicle in conjunction with surgical release of all attachments of the scapula to the spine, excision of any <b>omovertebral</b> bone and resection of prominent supraspinous process of scapula. The patients included ten female and three male patients (age range {{at the time of}} operation, 3.3 – 10  years; mean: 6.11  years). The deformity involved the left shoulder in eight patients, the right shoulder in three and two were bilateral. All patients were followed for an average of 5.9  years (range 4 – 11  years). Preoperatively, the arc of total abduction (glenohumeral and scapulothoracic) ranged from 80 to 140 °, and the average was 110 °. The shoulders were level, and the range of motion was dramatically improved with an average range of abduction of 166.5 ° (range 140 – 180 °). The age of the patients and the presence of an <b>omovertebral</b> bone did not influence the results. All patients and their parents expressed satisfaction with the operative results. We feel that our procedure is a simple one, which helps to improve the degree of correction, avoid neurovascular complications and has the advantage of complete regeneration of the clavicle. The technique provides an easy, safe method of repositioning the scapula at its normal level.|$|E
30|$|The scapula is {{originally}} located as a sagittally-oriented {{structure in}} the neck. It then migrates to a coronally aligned posterior thoracic position. In congenital high scapula (CHS), failure of of the scapula to descend leaves it in an elevated, malrotated position. The bone is small and broad, the periscapular muscles are hypoplastic and the scapula is rotated with its inferior angle medialised and the glenoid directed inferiorly. Fibrous bands tether the scapula to the chest wall, limiting rotation. The superior angle {{is attached to the}} cervical spine by an <b>omovertebral</b> bar (OVB) in 40  % of cases. Associated anomalies of the cervico-thoracic spine are common [1].|$|E
30|$|There {{were only}} minor {{complications}} noted, including one widened scar, one superior angle exostosis and one seroma. Temporary or permanent brachial plexus palsy {{has been described}} after surgical correction of Sprengel’s deformity [24, 26]. There were no cases of brachial plexus palsy induced by our method of surgery. Sprengel’s deformity is a significant structural abnormality that produces an unsightly cosmetic appearance, restricts shoulder motion, and cannot be treated conservatively. We believe the most favourable cosmetic and functional results with low morbidity in patients with Sprengel’s deformity are obtained by subperiosteal resection of the middle third of the clavicle combined with resection of the prominent superomedial border of the scapula, supraspinous portion {{as well as the}} <b>omovertebral</b> connection, and downward displacement of the scapula to a more inferior position.|$|E
30|$|The age of our {{patients}} {{at the time of}} the procedure varied from 3.3 to 10  years (average, 6  years 1  month). We did not find significant differences in any of the indices evaluated for {{our patients}} in different age groups at the time of surgery. We saw an average improvement of 56.5 ° in combined shoulder abduction in our patients, which agrees with the average improvement of 23 – 77 ° reported in the literature [2, 9, 11, 20, 25, 26]. Cosmesis and functional impairment are the usual indications for surgical correction of the scapula [12]. All our patients had cosmesis problems, functional disability or both. Simple excision of the superomedial part of the scapula and the <b>omovertebral</b> bone or proximal muscles release to allow the scapula to be transplanted distally is associated with an unacceptable rate of incomplete correction or recurrent deformity [8, 12].|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} Sprengel’s {{deformity}} were treated surgically by {{a modification of}} Green’s procedure. After clavicular osteotomy, all muscular attachments to the scapula were freed; an <b>omovertebral</b> band if present was cut and the scapula was rotated and moved caudal to a more normal position, to be sutured into a pocket of the latissimus dorsi. The patients included 10 female and 2 male patients (age range {{at the time of}} operation: 3 to 9 years; mean: 5. 2 years). The deformity involved the left shoulder in 8 patients, the right shoulder in 4. All patients were followed for an average of 2 years (range: 6 months to 4. 5 years). The range of flexion improved from an average of 95 ° to 105 ° and the range of abduction from an average of 81 ° to 97 °. Cosmesis was improved in all 12 patients but three patients had an unsightly surgical scar. Surgical treatment by a mod-ified Green procedure for patients with Sprengel’s deformity is indicated when the patient and family want cosmetic or functional improvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{outcome of}} 56 {{children}} (61 shoulders) treated surgically at the Rizzoli Institute between April 1975 and June 2010 for congenital {{elevation of the}} scapula is reported. There were 31 girls and 25 boys {{with a mean age}} at surgery of 6. 4 years (2 to 15). The deformity involved the right shoulder in 20 cases, the left in 31 and was bilateral in five. The degree of the deformity was graded clinically and radiologically according to the classifications of Cavendish and Rigault, respectively. All patients underwent a modified Green procedure combined, in selected cases, with resection of the superomedial portion of the scapula and excision of any <b>omovertebral</b> connection. After a mean follow-up of 10. 9 years (1 to 29. 3), there was cosmetic improvement by at least one Cavendish grade in 54 shoulders (88. 5 %). The mean abduction of the shoulder improved from 92 ° (50 ° to 155 °) to 112 ° (90 ° to 170 °) and the mean flexion improved from 121 ° (80 ° to 160 °) to 155 ° (120 ° to 175 °). The unsatisfactory cosmetic result in seven shoulders was due to coexistent scoliosis in two cases and insufficient reduction of the scapular elevation in the other five. An incomplete upper brachial plexus palsy occurred post-operatively in three patients but resolved within seven months...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sprengel&#x 2032;s {{shoulder}} {{is characterized}} by scapular maldescent and malposition, causing restriction of shoulder and cervical spine movements. It {{is associated with a}} variety of other congenital anomalies. Various surgical procedures have been described to treat this anomaly with no consensus as to the surgical procedure of choice. We report the results of the Mears procedure in the treatment of Sprengel&#x 2032;s shoulder. Materials and Methods: Seven children between the age group of two and six years were treated for Sprengel&#x 2032;s deformity, with <b>omovertebral</b> bar, and other congenital anomalies. The Cavendish score and Rigault radiological score were used to assess the severity of the deformity, and the position of the scapula relative to the cervical spine, respectively. The Mears procedure involved scapular osteotomy, par tial scapular excision, and release of a long head of triceps. Clavicular osteotomy was done only in two cases to decrease the risk of traction injury to the brachial plexus. Postoperatively, the patients were immobilized in a shoulder sling and range of motion exercises were started as early as possible. The patients were followed regularly at six weeks, three months and regularly at six-months interval. Results: The mean improvement in flexion and abduction was 45 &# 176; (40 - 70 &# 176;) and 50 &# 176; (40 - 70 &# 176;), respectively, which was the combined glenohumeral and thoracoscapular movement. The cosmetic and functional improvement by this procedure was acceptable to the patients. Minor scar hypertrophy was seen in two cases. Conclusion: The Mears procedure gives excellent cosmetic and functional results. This procedure addresses the functional aspect of the deformity and is much more acceptable to the patient and parents...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{results of}} surgical procedures for severe Sprengel's deformity have been uncertain. To obtain improved elevation, we consider {{that it is}} necessary to realign the lateral border of the scapula for upward rotation. The purposes of the current study were to evaluate the clinical results and range of motion of the scapula after such realignment. Methods: Seven cases of Sprengel's deformity of Cavendish grade 3 or 4 were treated surgically and then clinically evaluated and examined using three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D CT). (Two boys and five girls aged 50. 9 ± 15. 4 months, mean ± standard deviation at the time of operation.) The mean follow-up was 53. 1 months (range, 12 to 92 months). After the <b>omovertebral</b> bone and the superomedial side of the scapula were removed, the levator scapulae and rhomboids were reattached to wrap around the scapula at maximum upward rotation to assist in maintaining this position. Cavendish and Rigault grades were used for evaluation of postoperative appearance. The superior displacement and rotation of the scapula were measured on the trunk posterior view using 3 D CT. The relationship between improvement in the range of motion and radiologic change were analyzed statistically. Results: The postoperative flexion (97. 9 ° ± 12. 9 ° to 160 ° ± 11. 5 °) and abduction (99. 3 ° ± 13. 0 ° to 161. 4 ° ± 15. 7 °) were significantly improved compared with the mean preoperative values (P <. 0001). 3 D CT revealed that in all patients the malrotation of the scapula was improved postoperatively. The current study shows that successful realignment of the scapula led to these improved clinical results. Conclusions: Our procedure has advantages not only for recovery of the range of motion but also for reducing the characteristic lump in the web of the neck. However, our procedure has an inherent limitation related to asymmetrical shoulder level and width. 3 D CT may be useful for preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation...|$|E
