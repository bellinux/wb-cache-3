40|$|The {{physiography}} and geomorphology of {{the coastal}} plains in Jambi and South Kalimantan were studied {{with the aim of}} describing the recent sediments deposited there. For this purpose, borings were made along transects from inland to the coast to a depth of up to 6 meters. The results of these studies indicate the presence of five physiographic regions and fifteen geomorphic units in the coastal plain of Jambi. In the coastal plain of South Kalimantan, four physiographic regions and eleven geomorphic units were established. The landforms in both of these coastal plains were developed by peat and mineral soil deposits. These deposits started to accumulate during the Holocene period. In Jambi, peats situated in the ombrogenous peats zone, which sometimes exceed 6 meters in depth, have been deposited since the terrestrial soils on the Pleistocene terrace were transformed into fluviatile swampy soils to form the so-called peat-capped terrace. Peats on mangrove deposits situated in the riverine to brackish deposits zone were formed in later periods. In the brackish to marine deposits zone, the thin peats are very young. In South Kalimantan, peats situated in the riverine to brackish deposits zone have been deposited on mangrove deposits and on sand or gravel. I believe that the peat formation on sand or gravel is of the same age as the <b>older</b> <b>peat</b> in Jambi...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} accumulation {{rates of}} mercury resulting from atmospheric deposition to four Scottish ombrotrophic peat bogs, Turclossie Moss (northeast Scotland), Flanders Moss (west-central), Red Moss of Balerno (east-central) and Carsegowan Moss (southwest), were determined via analysis of 210 Pb- and 14 C-dated cores up to 2000 years old. Average pre-industrial rates of mercury accumulation of 4. 5 and 3. 7 μg m− 2 y− 1 {{were obtained for}} Flanders Moss (A. D. 1 – 1800) and Red Moss of Balerno (A. D. 800 – 1800), respectively. Thereafter, mercury accumulation rates increased to typical maximum values of 51, 61, 77 and 85 μg m− 2 y− 1, recorded at different times possibly reflecting local/regional influences during the first 70 years of the 20 th century, at the four sites (TM, FM, RM, CM), before declining to a mean value of 27 ± 15 μg m− 2 y− 1 during the late 1990 s/early 2000 s. Comparison of such trends for mercury with those for lead and arsenic in the cores and also with direct data for the declining UK emissions of these three elements since 1970 suggested that a substantial proportion of the mercury deposited at these sites {{over the past few}} decades originated from outwith the UK, with contributions to wet and dry deposition arising from long-range transport of mercury released by sources such as combustion of coal. Confidence in the chronological reliability of these core-derived trends in absolute and relative accumulation of mercury, at least since the 19 th century, was provided by the excellent agreement between the corresponding detailed and characteristic temporal trends in the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb isotopic ratio of lead in the 210 Pb-dated Turclossie Moss core and those in archival Scottish Sphagnum moss samples of known date of collection. The possibility of some longer-term loss of volatile mercury released from diagenetically altered <b>older</b> <b>peat</b> cannot, however, be excluded by the findings of this study...|$|E
40|$|The Rieseberger Moor is a fen, 145 {{hectares}} in size, situated about 20 km east of Brunswick (Braunschweig), Lower Saxony, Germany. Peat was dug in the fen - {{with changing}} intensity - since the mid- 18 th century until around AD 1955. According to Schneekloth & Schneider (1971) the remaining peat (fen and wood peat) is predominantly 1. 5 to 2 m thick (maximum 2. 7 m). Part of the fen - now a nature reserve (NSG BR 005) - is wooded (Betula, Salix, Alnus). For {{more information on}} the Rieseberger Moor see [URL] Willi Selle was the first to publish pollen diagrams from this site (Selle 1935, profiles Rieseberger Torfmoor I and II). This report deals with a 2. 2 m long profile from the wooded south-eastern part of the fen consisting of strongly decomposed fen peat taken A. D. 1965 and studied by pollen analysis in the same year. The peat below 1. 45 m contained silt and clay, samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m even fine sand. These samples had to be treated with HF (hydrofluoric acid) in addition to the treatment with hot caustic potash solution. The coring ended in sandy material. The new pollen data reflect {{the early part of the}} known postglacial development of the vegetation of this area: the change from a birch dominated forest to a pine forest and the later spreading of Corylus and of the thermophilous deciduous tree genera Quercus, Ulmus, Tilia and Fraxinus followed by the expansion of Alnus. The new data are in agreement with Selle's results, except for Alnus, which in Selle's pollen diagram II shows high values (up to 42 % of the arboreal pollen sum) even in samples deposited before Corylus and Quercus started to spread. On contrary the new pollen diagram shows that alder pollen - although present in all samples - is frequent in the three youngest pollen spectra only. A period with dominating Alnus as seen in the uppermost part of Selle's pollen diagrams is missing. The latter is most likely the result of peat cutting at the later coring site, whereas the early, unusually high alder values of Selle's pollen study are probably caused by contamination of the pollen samples with younger peat. Selle took peat samples usually with a "Torfbohrer" (= Hiller sampler). This side-filling type of sampler with an inner chamber and an outer loose jacket offers - if not handled with appropriate care - ample opportunities to contaminate <b>older</b> <b>peat</b> with carried off younger material. Pollen grains of Fagus (2 % of the arboreal pollen sum) were found in two samples only, namely in the uppermost samples of the new profile (0. 18 m) and of Selle's profile I (0. 25 m). If this pollen is autochthonous, with other words: if this surface-near peat was not disturbed by human activities, the Fagus pollen indicates an Early Subboreal age of this part of the profile. The accumulation of the Rieseberg peat started during the Preboreal. Increased values of Corylus, Quercus and Ulmus indicate that sample 0. 78 m of the new profile is the oldest Boreal sample. The high Alnus values prove the Atlantic age of the younger peat. Whether Early Subboreal peat exists at the site is questionable, but evidently none of the three profiles reaches to Late Subboreal time, when Fagus spread in the region. Did peat-growth end during the Subboreal? Did younger peat exist, but got lost by peat cutting or has younger peat simply not yet been found in the Rieseberg fen? These questions cannot be answered with this study. The temporary decline of the curve of Pinus for the benefit of Betula during the Preboreal, unusual for this period, is contemporaneous with the deposition of sand (Rieseberger Moor II, 1. 33 - 1, 41 m; samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m of the new profile) and must be considered a local phenomenon.

40|$|Ch. I. The {{environment}} of the Dutch Wadden Sea, {{as well as that}} of the estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands can be divided into three sub-zones: (1) the channel floors (sensu lato), i. e. the areas below mean low tide level, (2) the tidal flats (sensu stricto), between the levels of mean low and mean high water and, (3) the salt marshes, above the level of mean high tide. The channel floors are composed, either of older sediments, which have been laid bare by erosion of the tidal currents, or by new deposits, formed in the channels themselves. The latter are predominantly of sandy character, but may show locally high contents of muddy material, especially in sheltered bays. The tidal flats consist for the greater part of sand. Slightly muddy sand is often encountered along the high tide lines and very muddy deposits, dissected by small ebb gullies, are frequently present along the sides of the channels. The marshes are usually composed of comparatively clayey deposits, which are cut through by creeks. Details are given concerning the morphology of these sub-zones, and on the processes of erosion and sedimentation, which are responsible both for the morphology and for the composition of the sediments. The chapter is based on own observations (most of them published before) and on the results of a great number of other investigators (see list of references). Ch. II. The chief sediments in the Wadden Sea are (1) sands, (2) mud and clay, (3) shell beds. “True” hard rock gravels are very rare. They occur in the vicinity of outcrops of older, psephitic deposits (glacial till). Special mention is made of the formation of gravelly sediments, composed of small, limonitic clay-rhizo-concretions (found at the base of marsh cliffs and in the mass of the marsh deposits themselves). Granulometrical analyses of Wadden sediments have been carried out by a number of authors. Several conclusions may be drawn from their work: The Wadden sands are rarely pure, but contain mostly a certain amount of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc; the average grain size of the sands decreases usually from the tidal inlets inwards; the material which has been transported in suspension, most of the time, shows a remarkably uniform grain size distribution along the whole length of the Dutch coast (Doeglas, Favejee, Hissink, Zuur) etc. Ch. III. The investigated sediments are mainly composed of psammitic and pelitic, elements of the following minerals: quartz, carbonates, micas and clay minerals, felspars, glauconites and heavy minerals. The quartz percentages decrease with diminishing of the grain size of the material under consideration. Micas and clay minerals show an increase in this same direction. Grains of carbonates and felspars have their maximum distribution in the siltfractions. From the heavy mineral composition of the Wadden Sea sands it may be deduced that the greater part of the material has been brought in from the North Sea, via the tidal inlets (Crommelin). The same conclusion is reached with regard to the silt fractions (Crommelin) and the clay material (Favejee). Ch. IV. The organic matter of the Wadden Sea sediments is partly derived from <b>older</b> <b>peat</b> beds which have been eroded; for another part it is produced by plants and animals living in the Wadden Sea area itself. The basic organic materials, required for the growth of the latter organisms, are probably chiefly supplied out of the North Sea (Verwey). The organic content of the Wadden Sea sediments may show a decrease from the surface downwards, at least in the first few decimeters. This is presumably due to decomposition, under the influence of bacterial activities, by enzymes and by purely chemical processes. A notable parallelism is observed between the percentage variations of the organic matter and those of the material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc. Ch. V. A close relation exists also between the percentages of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc and the iron content. This element is present in various authigenous compounds: Hydroxides of iron are found in marsh deposits (above the ground water table) and in the uppermost few millimeters or centimeters of the tidal flat and channel sediments. FeS. nH 2 O is formed in anaerobic environment, under the surface of the tidal flats and the channel floors. This substance tends to take up additional sulphur, thereby changing into pyrite. The pyrite is normally distributed in very small elements. Comparatively large, more or less globular aggregates of pyrite crystals (up to 40 0 ̆ 3 bc diameter) are seen in brackish water sediments. The transformation of iron hydroxides into monosulphuric compounds takes place in a short time. That of the FeS. nH 2 O into FeS 2 requires at least half a century. Where the vertical accretion has been continuous, a gradual change in colour is observed between the deep black monosulphuric sediments just below the surface and the greyish, pyritic material at greater depths. Ch. VI. The major part of the calcium carbonate material is (primarily) formed by calcareous organisms (foraminifera, echinoderms, molluscs etc.). A minor amount may have originated in other ways, e. g. by bacterial activities and by chemical processes. A relation is found between the increase of the carbonate percentages and the amounts of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc. A maximum is reached in the fraction 2 — 16 ft. Marsh sediments are subject to decalcification processes. The velocity of the solution of the carbonates depends on many factors, which require still further investigation. No decalcification phenomena are known from the normal tidal flat and channel floor sediments in the Netherlands. They have been observed, however, in the Basin of Arcachon (France). It is thought that the solution in this area is caused, at least to an important extent, by organic acids, produced during the decomposition of the large masses of dead Zostera remains, which are embedded in the sediments. Ch. VII. Considerable quantities of silica are formed on the surface of the tidal flats by the skeletons of (living) benthonic diatoms. The numbers of dead skeletons which are encountered in the tidal flat deposits themselves are, however, mostly very small. In the marsh sediments a more normal relation seems to exist between the amounts of skeletons of living and of buried diatoms. It is supposed that, after the death of the organisms, a solution or at least a beginning peptization of the silica takes place, which is swifter in the tidal flat environment than in the marsh deposits, probably in consequence of the higher alkalinity. The relatively coarse and less soluble skeletons of a part of the planktonic diatoms are of much more even distribution and are found in all Wadden Sea sediments. Other sources of locally formed silica are: radiolarians, sponges and plants. Ch. VIII. This chapter gives some conclusions, to be drawn from the study of thin sections of Wadden Sea sediments and of various deposits formed in more brackish water environment. The minimum grain size of separate sand (and silt) laminae is about 40 0 ̆ 3 bc in the former and down to at least 20 0 ̆ 3 bc in the latter. The parallel orientation of mica flakes and clay minerals is often much more pronounced in brackish (and fresh) water muds than in muds of Wadden Sea origin. Another conclusion, following from thin section analysis, is that brackish water deposits often show a coating of the sand grains, which may be due to peptization of clay material. Ch. IX. Useful evidence regarding the circumstances of sediment formation can be gathered from the structures as seen in undisturbed core samples. Several types of laminations are described. The laminae of channel floor- and tidal flat deposits have comparatively even, smooth upper and lower sides. The sand may show current or wave ripple structures. The laminae are of a sublenticular character and cannot be traced over great horizontal distances. The marsh laminations are characterized by the somewhat undulating, nodular aspect of the lamiae. The structures of beach deposits differ from the channel floor- and tidal flat laminations in that their laminae are more strictly parallel (apart from ripple mark structures). Another difference between these two laminations is that the latter are normally free of mud material. The finest laminations, with the thinnest laminae, are found in (some) brackish water deposits. The laminations and other primary oppositional structures may be disturbed by secondary influences: the burrowing of bottom dwelling organisms, the penetration of the sediment by plant roots etc. The effect of the burrowing animals is in general most pronounced on the highest parts of the tidal flats, where the sedimentation tends to be slow, but continuous. A sharp limit is often found between the disturbed deposits of the high tidal flats and the overlying marsh sediments, the lower parts of which are scarcely inhabited by bottom dwelling animals at all. Among the other structures, which are dealt with in this chapter, special mention may be made of the fissures, developed in mud beds under a permanent cover of water. Some new data are presented concerning their distribution and character, but no satisfactory conclusion about the manner of their formation is reached. Ch. X. The sediment properties, described in the foregoing chapters, are summarized and arranged according to their distribution in the various environments of formation...|$|E

The bulk samples (< 250 μm and < 100 μm) often yielded the youngest dates. The age difference between the individual fractions depended on the layer depth and hence the true age of the sampled peats.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} stable isotopes of Sphagnum peat deposits for palaeoclimate research and to inform sampling strategies, we present results from a study of selected Sphagnum plant constituents. We report a combined stable carbon and oxygen isotope record of cellulose separately extracted from Sphagnum branches and stem sections manually sampled from a similar to 4000 year <b>old</b> <b>peat,</b> deposited in a small dry maar crater located in the Westeifel Volcanic Field, Germany. We have determined the species composition of each individual sample of Sphagnum branches to address {{the sensitivity of the}} stable isotope records to potential changes in Sphagnum assemblages. The youngest approximately 3000 years <b>old</b> <b>peat</b> section consists of scarcely decomposed Sphagnum plant material. From the bog's surface to a depth of similar to 60 cm the predominant species is Sphagnum magellanicum. Between similar to 60 and similar to 550 cm the peat predominantly consists of Sphagnum capillifolium var. rubellum. At greater depths the decomposition status increases, species identification is, however, solely achievable if the record under examination consists of moderately decomposed peat. The stable carbon and oxygen isotope values of cellulose from Sphagnum stem sections are significantly lighter than those of the branches. Both isotopic offsets between the different plant compounds exhibit a strong degree of correlation, are statistically highly significant and observable down-core. The stable carbon isotope offset averages to 1. 5 parts per thousand, however, presumably decreases with increasing age of the plant material. In contrast, the averaged oxygen isotope offset of 0. 9 parts per thousand is consistent in time. Our results imply that if no differentiation into Sphagnum branches and stem sections prior to stable isotope analyses is possible, erroneous interpretations of the isotope records are likely, since down-core changes in the ratio of branches to stem sections in the peat profile are most likely. This also implies that the removal of all non-Sphagnum plants or plant fragments is insufficient to retrieve stable isotope signals from peat deposits exclusively reflecting palaeo-environmental conditions. Even isotopic records from bulk Sphagnum cellulose comprise of two different signals: firstly, an environmental signal based on the plant response to external controls. This signal is, however, masked by a second plant physiological signal originating from the isotopic offset between branches and stem sections. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The bog acids, with pH levels similar to vinegar, conserve the human bodies {{in the same way as}} fruit is preserved by pickling. In addition, peat bogs form in areas lacking drainage and hence are characterized by almost completely anaerobic conditions. This environment, highly acidic and devoid of oxygen, denies the prevalent subsurface aerobic organisms any opportunity to initiate decomposition. Researchers discovered that conservation also required that they place the body in the bog during the winter or early spring when the water temperature is cold—i.e., less than 4°C (40°F). This allows bog acids to saturate the tissues before decay can begin. Bacteria are unable to grow rapidly enough for decomposition at temperatures under 4°C.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{preservation}} of <b>old</b> <b>peat</b> formations and the limited research developed on them, the contribution of peat oxidation to the global C cycle at geological scales is poorly understood. Iron duricrusts containing abundant well-preserved plant structures have been reported above Humic Gleysols in the Uberaba Plateau (Brazil). We show that the iron accumulation results from an in-situ impregnation of peat, fast enough to preserve the plant structures. The formation of iron oxides results from two processes: precipitation in the pores and C/Fe replacement. The iron duricrusts were probably triggered by oxidation of the peatland following dry climatic events during the last 50 kyr. The large amount of iron dissolved in peatland waters was immobilized contemporaneously with the destruction of organic matter. The oxidation of organic matter from the lower peat, dated at ca 24 - 27 kyr BP, may have released between 0. 08 and 2. 26 kg CO 2 m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the atmosphere. These rates are in a good agreement with present-day measurements of CO 2 release from drained peatlands. Although peatland formation {{has been identified as}} a significant contributor to the global CO 2 uptake, our findings suggest that natural peatland oxidation should also be considered as a source of atmospheric CO 2 during past climate change...|$|R
50|$|In 1895, an {{additional}} 10,000 acres of moor were leased from the Duchy of Cornwall. These areas were in use almost continuously from May to September. Remains of the targetry system then in use {{can still be}} seen in places around the moor. Access to the target area was by <b>old</b> miners' and <b>peat</b> cutters' tracks.|$|R
40|$|Peat {{molecular}} chemistry {{reflects a}} combination of plant input and decomposition. Both vegetation community {{and the degree of}} decomposition of plant remains are highly dependent on depth and fluctuation of the water table and thus peat organic matter (OM) chemistry reflects past hydrological conditions. Changes in hydrology according to the OM composition (by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, pyrolysis-GC/MS) in a high-resolution sampled monolith of an 8000 years <b>old</b> <b>peat</b> deposit are presented. Analysis of 18 modern vegetation species resulted in molecular markers for Erica spp., Deschampsia flexuosa, Juncus bulbosus and Carex binervis, in addition to more general markers which enabled differentiation between woody, grass and moss vegetation. Factor analysis of 106 pyrolysis products quantified for all peat samples enabled identification of mineral (Factor 1) and hydrological (Factor 2) conditions of the bog. Depth profiles of vegetation markers showed good agreement with those of the scores of both factors and enabled the identification of 14 relatively wet periods, dating to 1430 - 1865 AD, 930 - 1045 AD, 640 AD, 270 - 385 AD, 190 - 215 AD, 135 AD, 45 BC- 15 AD, 260 - 140 BC, 640 - 440 BC, 1055 - 960 BC, 1505 - 1260 BC, 2300 BC, 41902945 BC and 5700 - 5205 BC, which show excellent agreement with other palaeoclimatic studies in Europe. The results emphasize the importance of high-resolution sampling, in combination with the use of multiple vegetation markers and other peat OM characteristics for a proper interpretation of a peat record...|$|R
500|$|As {{it might}} be {{recognised}} today, Chat Moss {{is thought to be}} about 7,000years <b>old,</b> but <b>peat</b> development seems to have begun there with the ending of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The depth of peat ranges from [...] A great deal of reclamation work has been carried out, particularly during the 19th century, but a large-scale network of drainage channels is still required to keep the land from reverting to bog. In 1958 workers extracting peat discovered the severed head of what is believed to be a Romano-British Celt, possibly a sacrificial victim, {{in the eastern part of}} the bog near Worsley.|$|R
40|$|A 6200 year <b>old</b> <b>peat</b> sequence, cored in a {{volcanic}} crater on the sub-Antarctic Ile de la Possession (Iles Crozet), has been investigated, {{based on a}} multi-proxy approach. The methods applied are macrobotanical (mosses, seeds and fruits) and diatom analyses, complemented by geochemical (Rock-Eval 6) and rock magnetic measurements. The chronology of the core is based on 5 radiocarbon dates. When combining all the proxy data the following changes could be inferred. From {{the onset of the}} peat formation (6200 cal yr BP) until ca. 5550 cal yr BP, biological production was high and climatic conditions must have been relatively warm. At ca. 5550 cal yr BP a shift to low biological production occurred, lasting until ca. 4600 cal yr BP. During this period the organic matter is well preserved, pointing to a cold and/or wet environment. At ca. 4600 cal yr BP, biological production increased again. From ca. 4600 cal yr BP until ca. 4100 cal yr BP a 'hollow and hummock' micro topography developed at the peat surface, resulting {{in the presence of a}} mixture of wetter and drier species in the macrobotanical record. After ca. 4100 cal yr BP, the wet species disappear and a generally drier, acidic bog came into existence. A major shift in all the proxy data is observed at ca. 2800 cal yr BP, pointing to wetter and especially windier climatic conditions on the island probably caused by an intensification and/or latitudinal shift of the southern westerly belt. Caused by a stronger wind regime, erosion of the peat surface occurred at that time and a lake was formed in the peat deposits of the crater, which is still present today...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands in the Snowy Mountains cover nearly 8000 ha and {{preserve}} 49 million m 3 of peat, of which 27. 1 million m 3 {{is stored in}} Sphagnum shrublands and restiad moorlands and 21. 9 million m 3 is stored in sedge fen. The total carbon store {{is estimated to be}} about 3. 55 Tg. Peat accumulation over the past 60 years indicates that the historical carbon accumulation rate is only 4950 Mg yr- 1 for the entire peat estate. This equates to net carbon storage rates of 0. 8 – 1. 6 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 which is similar to the rates of 0. 2 to 2. 3 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 found in other temperate peatlands. Peat sections covering the last 3000 to 4000 years, however, retain a millennial-scale net long-term storage of 0. 09 to 0. 21 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 totalling 2340 Mg yr- 1. The lower storage value of the <b>older</b> <b>peats</b> is partly due to continuing slow peat decay but may also represent accelerated decay due to disturbance by a 100 -year phase of stock grazing and intentional burning in the mountains. Some peatlands are recovering strongly since grazing was stopped but they are still vulnerable to hydrological changes caused by trampling by large mammals. Rates of carbon sequestration will be sensitive to climate change, as the peatlands are already stressed by these former land management practices and many are at their climatic limits. The active management of peatland hydrology and surface stabilisation is essential to peatland recovery and the conservation of these significant carbon stores. G. S. Hope and R. A. Nanso...|$|R
