5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Ships</b> on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Ships</b> was project officer.|$|E

40|$|The small far {{infrared}} target <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> in surge interference {{is easy to}} have visual deviation causing the low accuracy of target positioning and the bad target identification performance. In order to improve the accuracy of far small infrared targets recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> under surge interference, this paper proposed far small infrared target recognition algorithm <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> based on distributed target position estimation and DOA location in computer vision model for constructing coherent distributed source array model of far small infrared target distribution <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> This algorithm used MUSIC algorithm for the beamforming processing of far small infrared target echo model <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> Combined with the adaptive filtering algorithm we carried out the surge interference suppression and the estimation of central direction of arrival and angle spread of far small infrared target <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> through multidimensional spectrum peak searching algorithm, realizing the joint estimation <b>of</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> target, DOA and frequency parameters, so as to realize the accurate positioning and recognition of targets. Simulation results show that using this method for the far small infrared target recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> under surge interference, the spectral peak sharpness of spectral peak search of target position is high, side-lobe suppression performance is good, which shows the high accuracy of target position estimation and location, the accuracy and anti-interference performance of far small infrared target recognition <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is good, and has superior performance...|$|R
