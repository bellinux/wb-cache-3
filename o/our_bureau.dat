40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to bring you up-to-date {{on the progress of}} various winter starling control projects conducted by <b>our</b> <b>Bureau</b> on feedlots in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This report briefly covers the field work accomplished since that reported by the late Mr. H. Nelson Elliott in his paper delivered to the second meeting of your conference held in Anaheim, California, in March 1964. Prior to the winter of 1960 - 61 we experienced a tremendous build-up of starling populations in feedlot situations throughout the Pacific Northwest. The expanding livestock feeding industry was receiving great economic losses from starlings eating livestock feed and fouling additional feed and water. Conventional measures such as hazing and shooting were ineffective in protecting the feed yards. It was evident to this Bureau that means and measures had to be found to reduce starling numbers in feedlot situations. Due to starling build-ups an intensive experimental control project under field conditions was undertaken in Idaho in the winter of 1960 - 61. The experimental research was under the leadership of biologists of the Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s Denver Wildlife Research Center. The field operations were made possible through financial participation of the Idaho Cattle Feeders and the Idaho Department of Agriculture. Various control techniques were utilized and a summary of these is contained in Mr. H. Nelson Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s presentation to the Second Vertebrate Pest Control Conference. He also reported that the use of thallium sulphate baiting had reduced starling damage in feedlots, but the Bureau did not anticipate registration of thallium for bird control and that further emphasis would be placed on the development of more selective lethal agents...|$|E

40|$|Our {{chairman}} has wisely {{asked that}} we not spend all of our time here telling each other about our bird problems. In the Southeast, our difficulties with blackbirds are based upon the same bird habits that cause trouble elsewhere: they flock, they roost and they eat, generally {{taking advantage of the}} readily available handouts that today 2 ̆ 7 s agricul¬tural practices provide. Those of us {{on the receiving end of}} these de¬predations of course think that damage in our own particular area must be far the worst, anywhere. Because of the location of our meeting place today, perhaps it is worthwhile to point out that a report prepared by <b>our</b> <b>Bureau</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Washington office this year outlined the problem of blackbird damage to corn in the Middle Atlantic States, the Great Lakes Region and in Florida, and then followed with this statement [...] 2 ̆ 2 An equally serious problem occurs in rice and grain sorghum fields of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. 2 ̆ 2 The report also men¬tions that the largest winter concentrations of blackbirds are found in the lower Mississippi Valley. Our 1963 - 64 blackbird-starling survey showed 43 principal roosts totaling approximately 100 million of these birds in Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky. We have our own birds during the summer plus the 2 ̆ 2 tourist 2 ̆ 2 birds from up here and elsewhere during the winter, and all of these birds must eat, so suffice it to say that we, too, have some bird problems in the Southeast. I 2 ̆ 7 m sure you 2 ̆ 7 re more interested in what we 2 ̆ 7 re doing about them. To keep this in perspective also, please bear in mind that against the magnitude of these problems, our blackbird control research staff at Gainesville consists of 3 biologists, 1 biochemist and one technician. And unfortunately, none of us happens to be a miracle worker. I think, though, we have made great progress toward solving the bird problems in the Southeast for the man-hours that have been expended in this re¬search. My only suggestion to those who are impatient about not having more answers is that they examine the budget that has been set up for this work. Only then could we intelligently discuss what might be expected as a reasonable rate of research progress. When I think about what we have accomplished in a short span of time, with very small expenditure, I can assure you that I am very proud of our small research crew at Gainesville [...] and I say this quite sincerely. At the Gainesville station, we work under two general research approaches to the bird damage problem. These projects have been assigned to us. The first is research on management of birds, particularly blackbirds and starlings destructive to crops or in feedlots, and, secondly, the development and the adaptation of those chemical compounds found to be toxic to birds but relatively safe to mammals. These approaches both require laboratory and field work that is further subdivided into several specific research projects. Without describing the details of these now, I want to mention some of our recent results. From the results, I 2 ̆ 7 m sure you will gather the general objectives and some of the procedures used...|$|E

Berneri wrote, [...] "with his pro-war attitude Kropotkin separated himself from anarchism," [...] and asserted that the Manifesto of the Sixteen [...] "marks the culmination of incoherence in the pro-war anarchists; Kropotkin also supported Kerensky in Russia on the question of prosecuting the war." [...] Anarchist scholar Vernon Richards speculates that {{were it not for the}} desire of Freedom editor Thomas Keell (himself staunchly anti-war) to give the supporters of the war a fair hearing from the start, they might have found themselves politically isolated far earlier.|$|R
5000|$|On August 18, 2016, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates {{announced}} that the Justice Department intended to end its contracts with for-profit prison operators, because it concluded [...] "...the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services..." [...] than the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In response, MTC's spokesperson, Issa Arnita, said, it was [...] "disappointed" [...] {{to learn about the}} DOJ's decision. [...] "If the DOJ's decision to end the use of contract prisons were based solely on declining inmate populations, there may be some justification, but to base this decision on cost, safety and security, and programming is wrong." [...] In a memorandum, Yates continued, for-profit [...] "...prisons served an important role during a difficult period, but time has shown that they compare poorly to <b>our</b> own <b>Bureau</b> facilities. They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in {{a recent report by the}} Department's Office of Inspector General (O.I.G.), they do not maintain the same level of safety and security. The rehabilitative services that the Bureau provides, such as educational programs and job training, have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety." [...] The findings of the report were called into question in articles in Bloomberg News, and the National Review, For-profit prison operators, including MTC, contended that the report lacked objectivity. The O.I.G.'s report itself noted some difficulties with its conclusions, to wit: [...] "Moreover, we were unable to compare the overall costs of incarceration between BOP institutions and contract prisons in part because of the different nature of the inmate populations and programs offered in those facilities." [...] "We note that we were unable to evaluate all of the factors that contributed to the underlying data, including the effect of inmate demographics and facility locations." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mr. Dempster {{had lost his}} {{excellent}} client, Mr. Jerome--a loss which galled him {{out of proportion to}} the mere monetary deficit it represented. The attorney loved money, but he loved power still better. He had always been proud of having early won the confidence of a conventicle-goer, and of being able to 'turn the prop of Salem round his thumb'. Like most other men, too, he had a certain kindness towards those who had employed him when he was only starting in life; and just as we do not like to part with an old weather-glass from our study, or a two-feet ruler that we have carried in our pocket ever since we began business, so Mr. Dempster did not like having to erase his old client's name from the accustomed drawer in the <b>bureau.</b> <b>Our</b> habitual life is like a wall hung with pictures, which has been shone on by the suns of many years: take one of the pictures away, and it leaves a definite blank space, to which our eyes can never turn without a sensation of discomfort. Nay, the involuntary loss of any familiar object almost always brings a chill as from an evil omen; {{it seems to be the}} first finger-shadow of advancing death.|$|R
