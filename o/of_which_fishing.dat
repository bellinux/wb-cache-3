40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{the northwestern}} European {{household}} and family pattern as a backdrop, household and family structures were studied in four coastal regions in Sweden {{during the nineteenth}} century. Each area representeda variant of a maritime ecotype. Mean householdsize anda simple family structure were found in three areas, although economic circumstances dgfered significantly. True fishermen lived in Gullholnten, fishernren-farmers in Hasslo, and fainter-fishermen in Tyndero. In Ha" 1 lnas average household size was relatively small, although complex family structures were common. A diversified local economy <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>fishing</b> was only one contponent gave rise to this pattern. The involvement {{of the state in}} restricting access to resources andlor restricting property management was found to be a key factor in explaining why some areas developedsimilarpatterns despite varying economies.

40|$|In Swedish law, {{there is}} a strong {{protection}} for fish conservation applicable to land parcelling as a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>fishing</b> is divided. The provisions regarding the split of fishing, as found in FBL 3 : 8, represents a strong public interest and is legally binding for the fishing right holder. In short, this means that a fish right bounded to property may not be divided by land parcelling in a manner that cause problem of any significance for fish conservation. Lantmäteriet in its role as authority shall examine whether the division of fishing causes problems for fish conservation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the authority interprets and applies FBL 3 : 8 when dividing fishing. To investigate this, a survey and interview survey was handed out to the authority. The result shows that the number of fish dividing cases differ between surveyors which affects how common they handle FBL 3 : 8. The study also showed that about every third fish case had not an investigation to FBL 3 : 8. The application of FBL 3 : 8 differs by province, but also between every single surveyor. In some areas the surveyors are very restrictive and in some other areas they find dividing of fishing acceptable in certain special situations.

40|$|Aruba, located {{close to}} the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela, {{is one of the}} most densely {{populated}} islands in the Caribbean and supports a wide range of marine-related socio-economic activities. However, little is known about the impacts of human activities on the marine environment. Injuries in marine mammals can be used to examine interactions with human activities and identify potential threats to the survival of populations. The prevalence of external injuries and tooth rake marks were examined in Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) (n =  179), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (n =  76) and false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) (n =  71) in Aruban waters using photo identification techniques. Eleven injury categories were defined and linked to either human-related activities or natural causes. All injury categories were observed. In total, 18. 7 % of all individuals had at least one injury. Almost half (41. 7 %) of the injuries could be attributed to human interactions, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>fishing</b> gear was the most common cause (53. 3 %) followed by propeller hits (13. 3 %). Major disfigurements were observed in all three species and could be attributed to interactions with fishing gear. The results of this study indicate that fishing gear and propeller hits may pose threats to small and medium-sized cetaceans in Aruban waters. Thus, long-term monitoring of population trends is warranted. Shark-inflicted bite wounds were observed in Atlantic spotted dolphin and bottlenose dolphin. Bite wounds of cookie cutter sharks (Isistius sp.) were recorded in all three species, and include the first documented record of a cookie cutter shark bite in Atlantic spotted dolphin. This is one of the few studies which investigates the prevalence of injuries in cetaceans in the Caribbean. Further study is necessary to determine to which extent the injuries observed in Aruba affect the health and survival of local populations...|$|E
