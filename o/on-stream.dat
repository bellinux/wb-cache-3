50|$|Following the PNG Government’s {{introduction}} of a marginal field tax regime to encourage the development of smaller oil fields, and the transfer of Operatorship, Oil Search commenced detailed technical and engineering studies on the SE Mananda field during 2003. This work confirmed that the field was economic based on a low cost development and incorporating an appropriate fiscal regime. A development plan was sanctioned in 2004 and the fiscal and regulatory framework agreed with the PNG Government in early 2005. The SE Mananda development came <b>on-stream</b> in early 2006.|$|E
50|$|Residual {{oil from}} the vacuum {{distillation}} unit (sometimes including high-boiling oils from other sources within the refinery) is pumped {{into the bottom of}} the distillation column called the main fractionator. From there, it is pumped, along with some injected steam, into the fuel-fired furnace and heated to its thermal cracking temperature of about 480 °C. Thermal cracking begins in the pipe between the furnace and the coke drums, and finishes in the coke drum that is <b>on-stream.</b> The injected steam helps to minimize the deposition of coke within the furnace tubes.|$|E

50|$|In 1949 Esso {{embarked}} {{on the construction}} of a new refinery, and a further 1200 hectares of land were acquired. The first stage of this expansion, which came <b>on-stream</b> in 1951, consisted of primary distillation units, a catalytic cracker and numerous treating units. The refinery was opened by British prime minister Clement Attlee on 14 September 1951. It had an initial estimated capacity of 157,000 barrels per day, or around one third of UK demand at that time. The chemical plant was created in 1958. Additional refining capacity was added, and Fawley's capacity reached around 19,500,000 tonnes of crude oil per annum in 1973 (approximately 400,000 barrels per day), and has since decreased, partly because of reduced demand for oil.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, gas {{production}} commenced from the Lakshmi gas field, which {{is situated in}} Block CB/OS-2 in the Cambay Basin of {{the west coast of}} India in the Gulf of Khambhat. The Gauri offshore gas field was discovered in 2001 and came <b>on-stream</b> in 2004. CB-X, a marginal gas field in the transition zone of the CB/OS-2 block was in production between June 2007 and August 2009. The Lakshmi and Gauri fields commenced production of oil in addition to its {{gas production}} in 2005. The CB/OS-2 Block has completed 10 years of production and crossed a cumulative production of over 50 mmboe hydrocarbons.Safety and operational integrity have been a strong area of focus for the CB/OS-2 asset operations team. The asset team recorded 0.93 million LTI free hours and delivered facilities uptime of 99.9% during FY 2012-13.. The block has recorded more than nine million safe work hours over the last seven years.|$|E
50|$|The {{very visible}} {{hand of the}} state is also needed in another sense: Russian {{reliance}} on raw materials and energy exports is not sustainable, as the sources of supply went <b>on-stream</b> during the Soviet period. Current-day Russia is living off this substance: once the supply dries up, the shortfall may not be replaced, as the prohibitive start-up investments required for new development projects make these uncompetitive under market conditions. For Russia to be sustainable, it must grow organically, clustering in strategic pockets; first, however, it needs to contract, and this includes the de-urbanisation of parts of Siberia where human settlement is unsustainable under market conditions. While, liberalism is something a downsized Russia could live with quite well, the structurally distorted and unsustainable Russia of today is dependent on state intervention. The catch (or tragedy) is that this contention holds despite the massive levels of predation by Russian bureaucrats. The solution is also the problem.|$|E
5000|$|The wider {{development}} of Bergün/Bravuogn {{as a tourist}} destination that had been anticipated in 1906 never materialised: the Kurhaus has remained the only substantial hotel in the village. The spectacular Albula Railway did indeed provide, for the first time, a reliable year-round transport connection towards Chur, but it also enabled the well-heeled to travel directly to higher and better promoted resorts further south in Graubunden, notably St.Moritz and Pontresina, without needing to pause at Bergün/Bravuogn. Despite [...] {{from some of the}} canton's conservative elements, the ban on private motor car usage was grudgingly lifted in the mid 1920s, and during the ensuing decades the more prosperous guests for whom the hotel had been designed increasingly used cars, which highlighted the fact that the village had never acquired reliable year-round road links, especially upriver, to the south. The Kurhaus had come <b>on-stream</b> in 1906 with substantial debts, set in one source at an initial level of 73,000 Francs, and revenues never justified the size of the initial investment.|$|E
50|$|The first project {{handled by}} Crescent was the Mubarek Field {{off the coast}} of UAE. Within 13 months from the discovery, it was on full {{production}} at a rate of over 60,000 barrels of oil per day, with the drilling of three additional wells, the installation of the processing platform, an additional well-head platform, export loading terminal, and associated support structures and pipelines. This was a world record at the time for bringing an offshore field <b>on-stream</b> from oil discovery. Crescent Petroleum has also earned several operational world records including the deepest short radius horizontal section drilled, and the deepest slim hole to be cased by expandable casing. Since the start of production in 1974, the Mubarek Field has undergone several development phases. The initial phase of the development of Ilam/Mishrif oil reservoir, at a depth of 3800 m was completed in 1977. Development of the Thamama gas condensate reservoir, at a depth of 4700 m, was started in 1987 for production of the gas and condensate. A central gas processing facility was established in the early 1990s, and gas export to Jebel Ali through a 150 km offshore pipeline was constructed. In late 2005, the company commenced a program of drilling further infill wells to increase production of petroleum.|$|E
50|$|Boyd and Julia Lammiman resettled {{their family}} in Calgary during Canada’s centennial summer, 1967. Over the next {{seventeen}} years, Lammiman (“Mr. L”) and {{the faculty and}} staff upgraded academic standards and created the “Christian Service Lab” and internship practicum. With Miss Aileen Case, Lammiman instituted predictable administrative process for the school’s academic year. With James Chapman, Lammiman improved ABC’s relations with its constituency, both donors and congregations. Alice Fraser (now, Mitchell), M.Div. (Cincinnati) was made full-time dean and instructor in 1967 till her departure in 1973. Gary Hatt, M.Div. (Emmanuel) was recruited in her place in 1974. In 1975, Ron Fraser, a recent graduate, came <b>on-stream</b> as a full-time instructor. By ABC’s 50th academic year 1981-1982, ABC was financially solvent, its faculty and staff were paid on time, relations with its constituency were warm, and {{a record number of}} students was enrolled. When a visiting college president was introduced to an ABC student in 1981, the student exclaimed, “This is the best Bible college in the world!”Mr. Lammiman guaranteed that what had been built under his leadership would serve as a foundation for more things to come when he collaborated with the trustees to recruit a successor and to plan for an orderly transition. With the completion of Mr. L’s ministry in summer, 1984, Ron Fraser was simultaneously installed as the new president.|$|E
