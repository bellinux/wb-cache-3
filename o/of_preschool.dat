25|$|A 2009 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving {{a total of}} 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care <b>of</b> <b>preschool</b> children with ASD {{in the areas of}} cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior. In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site randomized trials are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism. Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.|$|E
25|$|ABA-based {{techniques}} have demonstrated effectiveness in several controlled studies: {{children have been}} shown to make sustained gains in academic performance, adaptive behavior, and language, with outcomes significantly better than control groups. A 2009 review of educational interventions for children, whose mean age was six years or less at intake, found that the higher-quality studies all assessed ABA, that ABA is well-established and no other educational treatment is considered probably efficacious, and that intensive ABA treatment, carried out by trained therapists, is demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children. These gains maybe complicated by initial IQ. A 2008 evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches found that ABA is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD. A 2009 comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a form of ABA treatment, found that EIBI produces strong effects, suggesting that it can be effective for some children with autism; it also found that the large effects might be an artifact of comparison groups with treatments that have yet to be empirically validated, and that no comparisons between EIBI and other widely recognized treatment programs have been published. A 2009 systematic review came to the same principal conclusion that EIBI is effective for some but not all children, with wide variability in response to treatment; it also suggested that any gains are likely to be greatest {{in the first year of}} intervention. A 2009 meta-analysis concluded that EIBI has a large effect on full-scale intelligence and a moderate effect on adaptive behavior. However, a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis found that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care <b>of</b> <b>preschool</b> children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street {{had been on}} the air for over 20 years and was, as author Michael Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} <b>of</b> <b>preschool</b> television". [...] The show's dominance began to be challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as Barney & Friends, by the growth of the children's home video industry, and by the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable. [...] Sesame Street's ratings declined, so the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization responsible for putting the show on the air, responded by researching the reasons for their lower ratings.|$|E

40|$|In 1999 the childbearing increased, {{which in}} {{combination}} with the closure of a number <b>of</b> <b>preschools</b> led to the shortage and reduced capacity in available places for young children. The lack <b>of</b> places in <b>preschools</b> has led us {{to try to find a}} solution to the problem and in order to solve the problem we have interviewed personnel <b>of</b> <b>preschools</b> in Halmstad. The persons we met were asked to list advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> their <b>preschool</b> and also to come up with innovative solutions and new ideas of how to develop a satisfactory preschool. This was the basis for us when we drew our drawings and our main objective was to find a new template for the development <b>of</b> pre-fabricated <b>preschools.</b> When drawing a new and modern <b>preschool</b> a number <b>of</b> considerations have to be made, first of all the main objective for the children is play and playtime, a second objective is sound reduction and laws about sound reduction. Another consideration is how to construct the building and which method to be used, for instance should industrial techniques be considered and pros and cons be listed. The main disappointment amongst the preschool personnel was that they had no influence in the planning stage of the new development <b>of</b> the <b>preschool.</b> What we did was that we listened to the personnel and used their opinions when we created a constructional plan. This is a simple module made of prefabricated elements which ensures an easy production phase and {{in combination with}} the influences of the staff this would be the <b>preschool</b> <b>of</b> the future.

500|$|The show's {{research}} {{staff and}} producers conducted regularly-scheduled internal reviews and seminars {{to ensure that}} their curriculum goals were being met and to guide future production. As of 2001, ten seminars had been conducted specifically to address the literacy needs <b>of</b> <b>preschool</b> children. Curriculum seminars prior to Sesame Street's 33rd season in 2002 resulted in a change from the show's magazine-like format to a more narrative format. There have been over 1,000 studies as of 2001 which examine the show's impact on children's learning and attention. Most of these studies were conducted by the CTW and remain unpublished. The most important studies that found negative effects of Sesame Street were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little impact on the public discussion about Sesame Street. Another criticism was made by journalist Kay Hymowitz in 1995, who reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW [...] "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street was, as Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} <b>of</b> <b>preschool</b> television". [...] Entertainment Weekly reported in 1991 that the show's music had been honored with eight Grammys. [...] The show's dominance, however, was soon challenged by another PBS television show for preschoolers, Barney & Friends, and Sesame Street's ratings declined. [...] The producers of Sesame Street responded, at the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show's set, calling it [...] "Around the Corner". [...] New human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha {{and her parents}} Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi). [...] The [...] "Around the Corner" [...] set was dismantled in 1997. [...] Zoe, {{one of the few}} characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show: her spunky and fearless personality was intended to break female stereotypes. [...] According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW. [...] (The quest for a [...] "break-out" [...] female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.) [...] In 1998, {{for the first time in}} the show's history, Sesame Street pursued funding by accepting corporate sponsorship. [...] Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who had been a guest on the show, urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show.|$|E
