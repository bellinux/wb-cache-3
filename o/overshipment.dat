50|$|<b>Over{{shipment}}</b> {{and short}} shipment can both {{be caused by}} an error at the source, where the incorrect quantity is shipped or the incorrect quantity is listed. As the terms indicate, these can fundamentally be caused by errors in {{the source of the}} shipment. Short shipment can be reported by the recipient if some of the goods disappear in transit, such as by theft or loss. <b>Overshipment</b> is unlikely to occur due to changes in transit, unless spurious items somehow enter the cargo or the shipping list is damaged or altered in transit.|$|E
50|$|A short {{shipment}} is when cargo {{is listed}} on a shipping list but {{not included in}} a shipment, or not received by the recipient. Notably, when the quantity received {{is less than the}} quantity listed. Conversely, an <b>overshipment</b> is when the quantity received is more than the quantity listed. These can occur for a number of causes, and the term can refer both to actually shipping incorrectly, or to what the recipient reports on receipt, which may be for another cause.|$|E
50|$|When a short {{shipment}} or <b>overshipment</b> is noticed - {{most often}} by recipient, but potentially by sender if an error is noticed post-shipment - {{the other party}} should be informed promptly, so corrective action can be taken. These include supplemental shipments for short shipments, returning merchandise for overshipments, issuing corrected invoices if actual quantity is acceptable, etc. These can also include investigations into causes, to ensure that fraud or theft are not occurring, or to verify that a mistaken shipment actually occurred (and a short/over-shipment is not being incorrectly reported).|$|E
50|$|Short {{shipments}} and <b>overshipments</b> {{can cause}} accounting problems due to paperwork not matching {{up with the}} actual delivery, {{and need to be}} manually corrected.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe analyze {{degeneracy}} characterizations for two classical problems: {{the transportation}} paradox in linear transportation {{problems and the}} pure constant fixed charge transportation problem. Solving the pure constant fixed charge problem is equivalent to finding a basic tree solution with maximum degree of degeneracy. Problems possess degenerate solutions if the equal subsum property is satisfied for the supplies and demands. Determining the existence of degeneracy is an NP-complete problem. But this NP-hardness remains even if all equal subsums are known in advance. For the second problem, the transportation paradox, there exists a vast literature that typically describes methods, derived {{within the framework of}} the classical transportation algorithm, for determining solutions where the more-for-less phenomenon occurs. We show how to solve this problem as a simple standard network flow problem. The paradox is linked to <b>overshipment</b> solutions, which belong to supply and demand configurations that tend to have a high degree of degeneracy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the arrangements that have regulated trade in textiles and clothing have slowed the natural shift in comparative advantage from industrial countries to developing countries. But {{there is quite a}} bit of disagreement about how restrictive the Multi-Fibre Agreements (MFA) are. The authors address the potential sources of allocative inefficiency occasioned by the MFA and search for evidence that the MFA has indeed led to such inefficiency. In a theoretical section, they identify five sources of inefficiency relating to allocations across countries, across consumers, and among firms within constrained countries. In the empirical part of the paper, first they provide evidence of the restrictiveness of the quota arrangements from trends in import shares for aggregate categories of textiles and clothing, before and during the MFA. Then they provide evidence from a detailed examination of quota utilization rates and price differentials among EC importing countries. Among their findings: relatively high utilization rates across exporters suggest a relatively high degree (and stability) of quota bindingness across exporters; <b>overshipment</b> was highest for the most important (by shipment value) products; there is concentration among a few leading exports (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Thailand) and a few importers (Benelux, Germany, and the United Kingdom); the data suggest a positive correlation between the coefficients of variation in prices and quota utilization rates for China, Hong Kong, and Korea suggesting that prices are related, as one would expect, to the degree of bindingness; and the data suggest that binding quotas would be associated with higher import prices.
