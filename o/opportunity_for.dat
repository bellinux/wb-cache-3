5|$|Although Sicily {{had been}} raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century, these raids did not {{threaten}} Byzantine {{control over the}} island, which remained a largely peaceful backwater. The <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827, when {{the commander of the}} island's fleet, Euphemius, rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II. Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island, Euphemius sought the aid of the Aghlabids. The latter regarded this as an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviate the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad, and dispatched an army to aid him. Following the Arab landing on the island, Euphemius was quickly sidelined. An initial assault on the island's capital, Syracuse, failed, but the Muslims were able to weather the subsequent Byzantine counter-attack and hold on to a few fortresses. With the aid of reinforcements from Ifriqiya and al-Andalus, in 831 they took Palermo, which became the capital of the new Muslim province.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

40|$|A 100 % {{response}} was achieved (N = 106) on a questionnaire sent to educators {{in public school}} early childhood education classrooms in South Dakota. Analysis shows the background/certification of educators is significantly related to twenty of a possible thirty-one <b>opportunities</b> available <b>for</b> parental involvement. There is {{a relationship between the}} educational background/certification of the educator and curriculum utilization. The <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> children with special needs to interact with children, who are typically developing, show a significant relationship to the educational background/certification of the educator. <b>Opportunities</b> <b>for</b> parental involvement increases the likelihood that there will be <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> children with special needs to interact with typical children. There is a significant relationship between the utilization of a curriculum and <b>opportunities</b> available <b>for</b> interaction with typical children.

Five contextual factors are significantly related to <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> parental involvement. Towns with greater than 50, 000 are more likely to use curriculums.

40|$|Based on socio-emotional {{selectivity}} and self-categorization theories, {{we developed}} and tested a model {{on how the}} interplay between employee age and <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development predicts age bias and turnover intentions via intergenerational contact quality in the workplace. We hypothesized indirect effects of <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity on outcomes through intergenerational contact quality among older workers only, whereas we expected that the indirect effects of <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> development are stronger for young compared to older workers. Data came from 321 employees in Belgium who responded to an online questionnaire. Results showed that age moderated the relationships of <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development with intergenerational contact quality consistent with the expected patterns. Furthermore, age moderated the indirect effects of <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development on age bias through intergenerational contact quality, but not on turnover intentions. Implications for future research and practical suggestions for managing intergenerational contact at work are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Barrowclough's <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> {{a return}} to duty {{overseas}} came {{following the death of}} Mead in an aircraft crash in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, replacing them with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had left little <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> intensive tactical training and exercises.|$|E

Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks, including wider use of exceptions, reworking variable syntax to be more consistent and complete, and the deprecation or removal of various legacy features.|$|E
