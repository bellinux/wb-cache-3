5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> {{on nature}} and {{direction}} of linguistic change is not language-internal but language-external, that is, language contact patterns and, in many cases, lan-guage contact is not just one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> but is <b>the</b> major <b>influence.</b> Unfortunately, many linguistic descriptions pay only minimal attention to such sociolinguistic factors...|$|R

40|$|Analyzing <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{factors which}} <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> flow safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heated oil pipeline {{is an important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole assessment process, which is of great significance on the results analysis, phenomenon explanation, and risk control after the assessment. Focusing on the problems in <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors' importance analysis on crude oil pipeline flow assurance assessment, a new method to analyze <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors is proposed which considers the factors' fluctuations. Based on the actual probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors during <b>the</b> stable operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipeline, a new measure standard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors' importance is defined which can measure different factors importance and realize <b>the</b> importance sorting <b>of</b> each factor. <b>The</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> different factors on the inlet temperature is taken as an example. The importance analysis and sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors on <b>the</b> actual pipeline have been done, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> which are also compared. The results show that this method can combine the pipeline actual operating conditions and <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors' actual fluctuation, reflecting the effect on the results' importance in different values of each factor and different fluctuation. This method can make comprehensive analysis on <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> factors effectively...|$|R
5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} {{ideas in the}} Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's Transcendental idealism, {{as well as his}} celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of Islam in the region, Tajik {{was written in}} the Persian {{alphabet}} up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of {{the later}} Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was {{crossbred}} with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E

5|$|From 1988 to 1994, Marburger chaired Universities Research Association, the {{organization}} that operated Fermilab and oversaw construction of the ill-fated Superconducting Super Collider, an experience that is credited with convincing him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> government had in how science is carried out.

He stepped down as President of Stony Brook University in 1994, and began doing research again {{as a member of the}} faculty.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences.

5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E

5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Digging for Fire.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered to be the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E

5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the exact nature and extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E
5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such {{as the presence of}} saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.|$|E
5|$|A ridge located {{over the}} central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to intensify, the JTWC {{assessed}} the storm {{to have reached}} typhoon status at 1800UTC on June7. The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later. A 28km (17mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit. Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155km/h (100mph 1-minute winds). The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized {{the next day and}} was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute winds). The intensification was the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow. Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon 'Frank' as it moved out of their area of responsibility.|$|E
