25|$|Non-zero output impedance: Low <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> is {{important}} for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> effectively reduces the open loop gain.

25|$|Can {{increase}} or decrease <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> (depending on type of feedback).|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} seen by {{the load}} needs further discussion. The load in Figure 5 {{is connected to the}} collector of the output transistor, and therefore is separated from the body of the amplifier by the infinite impedance of the output current source. Therefore, feedback has no effect on the <b>output</b> <b>impedance,</b> which remains simply RC2 as {{seen by the}} load resistor RL in Figure 3.

40|$|<b>Output</b> <b>impedances</b> are {{inherent}} elements of power {{sources in the}} electrical grids. In this paper, we give {{an answer to the}} following question: What is the effect of <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> on the inductivity of the power network? To address this question, we propose a measure to evaluate the inductivity of the power grid. By exploiting this measure together with the algebraic connectivity of the network topology, one can tune the <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> in order to impose a desired level of inductivity on the power system. Results show that the more "connected" the network is, the more the <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> diffuse into the network...|$|R

25|$|A broader conclusion, {{independent}} of the quantitative details, is that feedback {{can be used to}} increase or to decrease the input and <b>output</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> is not zero, as {{it would}} be in an ideal op-amp, but with {{negative}} feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.|$|E

25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance outputs {{typically}} require high quiescent (i.e., idle) {{current in}} the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low <b>output</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the voltage}} gain {{for a typical}} 741-style op amp is of order 200,000, and the current gain, the ratio of input {{impedance}} (≈2−6 M) to <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> (≈50) provides yet more (power) gain.|$|E
40|$|Basic {{concepts}} {{with respect}} to stable operation of semi-autonomous low-voltage DC-grids are discussed. Design considerations on the <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> of power electronic converters are analysed {{in order to avoid}} resonance issues within a DC-grid. With calculated or measured converter <b>output</b> <b>impedances,</b> potential resonance problems due to background harmonics between aggregated power modules and the DC-grid can be forecasted. Simulation results are included for verification of the proposed ideas...|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{we have a}} set {{of layers}} to which we can apply TL method and {{determine}} input and <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> for each layer.|$|R
50|$|In {{the cases}} of devices with very high <b>output</b> <b>{{impedance}}s,</b> such as with a guitar or a high-Z mic, a DI box {{can be used to}} convert the high <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> to a lower impedance so as to not require the receiving device to have outrageously high input impedance and thus suffer drawbacks such as increased noise pickup with long cable runs. In such cases, the DI box is placed close to the source device (such as the guitar and mic), and any long cables are attached to the output of the DI box (which usually also converts unbalanced signals to balanced signals to further increase noise immunity).|$|R
25|$|An {{amplifier}} {{that uses}} feedback to connect {{part of the}} output back to the input is a bilateral amplifier. Bilateral amplifier input impedance depends on the load, and <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> on the signal source impedance.|$|E
25|$|An {{amplifier}} whose output exhibits no {{feedback to}} its input side {{is described as}} 'unilateral'. The input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of load, and <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> is independent of signal source impedance.|$|E
25|$|Figure 3 shows a two-transistor {{amplifier}} with a feedback resistor Rf. The aim is {{to analyze}} this circuit to find three items: the gain, the <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> looking into the amplifier from the load, and the input impedance looking into the amplifier from the source.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are high}} voltage/low current devices in {{comparison}} with transistors. Tetrode and pentode valves have very flat anode current vs. anode voltage indicating high anode <b>output</b> <b>impedances.</b> Triodes show a stronger relationship between anode voltage and anode current.|$|R
25|$|Input and <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> of a negative-feedback {{amplifier}} (closed-loop amplifier) become {{sensitive to the}} gain of an amplifier without feedback (open-loop amplifier)—that exposes these impedances to variations in the open-loop gain, for example, due to parameter variations or nonlinearity of the open-loop gain.|$|R
50|$|Tube {{amplifiers}} have sufficiently higher <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> {{that they}} normally included multi-tap output transformers to better match {{to the driver}} impedance. Sixteen ohm drivers (or loudspeakers systems) would {{be connected to the}} 16-ohm tap, 8 ohm to the 8 ohm tap, etc.|$|R
25|$|Historically, many {{headphones}} had {{relatively high}} impedance, often over 500ohms {{in order to}} operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low <b>output</b> <b>impedance,</b> enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external headphone amplifier may be beneficial.|$|E
25|$|Microphones have an {{electrical}} characteristic called impedance, measured in ohms(Ω), {{that depends on}} the design. In passive microphones, this value describes the electrical resistance of the magnet coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the output resistance of the amplifier circuitry. Typically, the rated impedance is stated. Low impedance is considered under 600Ω. Medium impedance is considered between 600Ω and 10kΩ. High impedance is above 10kΩ. Owing to their built-in amplifier, condenser microphones typically have an <b>output</b> <b>impedance</b> between 50 and 200Ω.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone <b>output</b> <b>impedance.</b> The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E

25|$|A non-ideal op amp's {{equivalent}} circuit has a finite input impedance, a non-zero <b>output</b> <b>impedance,</b> and a finite gain. This article illustrates some typical applications of operational amplifiers. A real op amp {{has a number}} of non-ideal features as shown in the diagram, but here a simplified schematic notation is used, and the reader is reminded that many details such as device selection and power supply connections are not shown. Operational amplifiers are optimised for use with negative feedback, and this article discusses only negative-feedback applications. When positive feedback is required, a comparator is usually more appropriate. See Comparator applications for further information.|$|E
25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low <b>output</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high MOSFET <b>output</b> <b>impedance,</b> {{which is to}} say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, {{the influence of the}} drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance, circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure.|$|E
40|$|Transient responses, {{input and}} <b>output</b> <b>impedances</b> have been derived {{for the use}} of the circuit designer.
