Outdoor workers spend a significant amount of time outside and are thus susceptible to this risk. In this case study, we estimated, for the first time, the realtime solar UVR exposure of an outdoor worker in Pretoria.

Personal exposure estimation was used to discern the pattern in diurnal and annual sunburn risk for the outdoor worker. Ambient UVR levels ranged from 0 UVI to 4. 66 UVI and the outdoor worker’s potential exposure estimates regularly exceeded 80 % of these levels depending on the time of day. The risk of sunburn was evident; however, actual incidents would depend on individual skin photosensitivity and melanin content, as well as sun protection used.

The data were compared with that from TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) Version 8 and show general agree-ment between the two. However, the Brewer UV measurement is about 10 % lower compared to TOMS data.

Time {{series of}} daily {{erythemal}} ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, <b>ozone,</b> and <b>cloud</b> cover were analyzed over the Australian continent using data sets from the NASA Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) from 1979 - 1992. The TOMS UVR exposures showed good agreement {{with data from}} surface observations. Using a relationship derived from comparisons of the TOMS partial cloud refiectivities with surface cloud cover observations, the TOMS refiectivities were converted into estimates of cloud cover for several Australian regions. It was shown that the deseasonalized time series of UVR exposures can be statistically described as a linear function of <b>ozone</b> and <b>cloud</b> cover anomalies. Results of a trend analysis indicated statistically significant increases in UVR exposures of 10 % decade- • in the summer months in the tropics. These were associated with a simultaneous depletion of ozone {{and a decrease in}} cloud cover. Midlatitudinal regions showed no significant trends of UVR. It was found that variations of ozone and UVR over Australia were significantly influenced by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). An increase in zonal wind strength of 20 m s- 1 was correlative with reductions of ozone of 1. 7 % and enhancements of UVR exposures of 2. 2 %. An increase in solar radio flux of 100 x 10 - 22 W m- 2 (Hz) - 1 was associated with significant reductions of UVR of 5 - 10 % in the tropical and subtropical regions in summer.
