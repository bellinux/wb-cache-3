Several in-fiber MZIs with different interferometer lengths were built and it is found that the interference dip wavelength spacing is inversely proportional to the interferometer length.

40|$|We {{consider}} a risk-aware forest owner and electricity producer evaluating the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) -based offsets with a benefit-sharing mechanism under uncertain CO 2 CO 2 prices. For {{a range of}} CO 2 CO 2 prices and respective risks perceived by the forest owner (seller) and electricity producer (buyer), we apply a model of fair (indifference) pricing.

The potentially contracted <b>amounts</b> of REDD <b>offsets</b> are analyzed under various risk preferences and for different benefit-sharing opportunities.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom {{about the effects}} of government debt is well summarized in survey articles (e. g., Elmendorf and Mankiw 1999). I will review these effects briefly and then focus on problems of solvency and credibility. Given the short maturity of U. S. public debt – over $ 2. 5 trillion maturing in 2010 – investor expectations are critical. To refinance its debt, the government must ensure that bond buyers remain firmly convinced of the government’s solvency. Conventional Effects Standard macro theories of government debt assume a world with well-functioning financial markets. Debt is issued to finance budget deficits. Unless private saving rise by an <b>offsetting</b> <b>amount,</b> the increased supply of government bonds raises interest rates. Higher interest rates raise the required return on private borrowing and thereby crowd out capital investment. A lower capital stock reduces the economy’s productive capacity and thus reduces future GDP. The damage is magnified if debt service requires distortionary taxes. If debt attracts foreign buyers, the interest rate and implied crowding-out effects are dampened, but then payments to foreign lenders reduce future GNP. Either way, deb...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{methods for}} generating and solving Cache Miss Equations (CMEs) that give a detailed representation of cache behavior, including conflict misses, in loop-oriented scientific code. Implemented within the SUIF compiler framework, our approach extends traditional compiler reuse analysis to generate linear Diophantine equations that summarize each loop's memory behavior. While solving these equations is in general difficult, {{we show that}} is also unnecessary as mathematical techniques for manipulating Diophantine equations allow us to relatively easily compute and/or {{reduce the number of}} possible solutions, where each solution corresponds to a potential cache miss. The mathematical precision of CMEs allows us to find true optimal solutions for transformations like blocking or padding. The generality of CMEs also allows us to reason about interactions between transformations applied in concert. The paper gives examples of their use to determine array padding and <b>offset</b> <b>amounts</b> that minimize cache misses, and also to determine optimal blocking factors for tiled code. Overall, these equations represent an analysis framework that offers the generality and precision needed for detailed compiler optimizations.

40|$|Policymakers are {{interested}} in the effect health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have had not only on the hospital expenditures of their enrollees, but also on the expenditures of non-HMO consumers. Previous studies of the "HMO effect" have focused on the comparison between hospital expenditures of HMO enrollees and those of non-HMO groups within the same market area. To the extent that the expenditures of non-HMO groups are affected by the presence of HMOs, this comparison will not give an accurate measure of the change in expenditures due to HMOs for either group. Using SMSAs without any HMOs as the comparison group can provide an accurate measure of the HMO effect on overall hospital expenses, if any nonrandom selection process of HMOs into SMSAs is controlled. In this article, the effect of prepaid group practices (PGPs) on overall hospital expenses is estimated using a simultaneous-equation model and all 283 standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) in 1980, controlling for any nonrandom selection process. The results indicate that while a significant selectivity bias exists that must be corrected, there is no significant PGP effect on hospital expenses. Controlling for other factors, hospital expenses per capita, per admission, and per day do not change as the PGP market share increases. While hospital expenses per capita for PGP enrollees may be falling, those of non-PGP groups in those SMSAs must be increasing by <b>offsetting</b> <b>amounts...</b>|$|R

40|$|FU Orionis is the {{prototype}} of a class of eruptive young stars (``FUors'') characterized by strong optical outbursts. We recently completed an exploratory survey of FUors using XMM-Newton to determine their X-ray properties, about which little was previously known. The prototype FU Ori and V 1735 Cyg were detected. The X-ray spectrum of FU Ori {{was found to be}} unusual, consisting of a cool moderately-absorbed component plus a hotter component viewed through an absorption column density that is an order of magnitude higher. We present here a sensitive (99 ks) follow-up X-ray observation of FU Ori obtained at higher angular resolution with Chandra ACIS-S. The unusual multi-component spectrum is confirmed. The hot component is centered on FU Ori and dominates the emission above 2 keV. It is variable (a signature of magnetic activity) and is probably coronal emission originating close to FU Ori's surface viewed through cool gas in FU Ori's strong wind or accretion stream. In contrast, the X-ray centroid of the soft emission below 2 keV is offset 0. 20 arcsec to the southeast of FU Ori, toward the near-IR companion (FU Ori S). This <b>offset</b> <b>amounts</b> to slightly less than half the separation between the two stars. The most likely explanation for the offset is that the companion contributes significantly to the softer X-ray emission below 2 keV (and weakly above 2 keV).
