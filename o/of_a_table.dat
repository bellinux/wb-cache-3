5|$|On September 26, 2006, Holly {{received}} 24 stitches from WWE Doctor Ferdinand Rios in {{his back}} after suffering a severe laceration during an Extreme Rules match against Rob Van Dam when he landed on the metal railing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> he was suplexing Van Dam {{out of the ring}} and through during an ECW show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Holly obtained the injury early in the match but continued to wrestle until the match's conclusion when he was pinned. After the match, as he was being helped out of the ring, he received a standing ovation from fans. The legitimate incident caused fans to cheer Holly in the following weeks, leading him to become a face character and a feud with Paul Heyman's other enforcer Test. His second to latest run as a face was short lived as he eventually turned on Rob Van Dam when they were partners in a tag match.|$|E

25|$|In 1690, the Great Parlour Chamber was {{occupied}} by John Batt. It has a garderobe or toilet in the outer wall. The rush matting in this and other family rooms was a feature of wealthy households, and was warmer than bare floorboards or stone floors. The fireplace is a 19th-century addition, one of few interior structural changes made since the 17th century. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> and chairs in a bed chamber in the 17th century was not unusual. Bed chambers had a dual purpose where their occupiers thought nothing of entertaining guests with wine or cards.|$|E
25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed in the middle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> to prevent damage from the inevitable splashes of burning brandy. In one variation a Christmas pudding {{is placed in the}} centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E

Von Friedeburg was ushered into Montgomery’s command caravan for confirmation that they were ready to sign. For the surrender ceremony Montgomery sat at the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with an army blanket draped over it and two BBC microphones in front of him; he called on each delegate in turn to sign the instrument of surrender document at 18.30. The surrender ceremony was filmed by the British Pathé News and recorded for broadcast on radio by the BBC with a commentary by the Australian war correspondent Chester Wilmot.|$|E
25|$|The result {{obtained}} for R depends {{only on the}} ratio E/V0. This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability of reflection regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, we seem to predict that when a marble rolls to the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the step function is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability of reflection approaches zero in the limit , where k is the wavenumber of the particle.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the West wall {{set into}} the floor is the cover <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> tomb, dating from the 15th Century. It is carved with supine male and female figures, a figure of a bird (an eagle or falcon) and a seated figure with one hand raised in benediction. There is an {{inscription}} that appears to read here lyeth the body and was buried the 2nd of July An. Do. 1638, suggesting that the tomb has been reused. The original occupants of the tomb must have been significant persons at least locally, but who they were remains a mystery. In the absence of identification for them they became known as The True Lovers, and the nearby riverside path became known as True Lovers' Walk.|$|E

25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E
25|$|The actors first {{receive the}} script in form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> draft and film the episode the next Monday, {{by which time}} the story may have changed drastically. The script keeps {{evolving}} during shooting. The actors first perform scenes as written, then act out the alts or improvise, to later allow the producers and editors to choose the gags that ultimately work best. Morris estimated that 20 percent of each episode are improv. Episodes are generally shot over five days, which may increase to several weeks if weather conditions delay filming outdoor scenes. The scenes are put together in the editing room until they achieve the emotional and comedic tone the producers are looking for. The first cut of generally 27 minutes has to be cut down to the air version's 21 minutes and 35 seconds, which may air {{as little as a}} few days later. Only upon completion do the producers know what version ends up in the episode.|$|E
25|$|For {{physical}} storage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> its rows {{are divided into}} a series of partitions (numbered 1 to n). The partition size is user defined; by default all rows are in a single partition. A table is split into multiple partitions in order to spread a database over a computer cluster. Rows in each partition are stored in either B-tree or heap structure. If the table has an associated, clustered index to allow fast retrieval of rows, the rows are stored in-order according to their index values, with a B-tree providing the index. The data is in the leaf node of the leaves, and other nodes storing the index values for the leaf data reachable from the respective nodes. If the index is non-clustered, the rows are not sorted according to the index keys. An indexed view has the same storage structure as an indexed table. A table without a clustered index is stored in an unordered heap structure. However, the table may have non-clustered indices to allow fast retrieval of rows. In some situations the heap structure has performance advantages over the clustered structure. Both heaps and B-trees can span multiple allocation units.|$|E
