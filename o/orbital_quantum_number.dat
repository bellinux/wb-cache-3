40|$|Using a {{combined}} analytical and numerical approach, we study the collective spin and orbital excitations in a spin-orbital chain under a crystal field. Irrespective {{of the crystal}} field strength, these excitations can be universally described by fractionalized fermions. The fractionalization phenomenon persists and contrasts strikingly with {{the case of a}} spin chain, where fractionalized spinons cannot be individually observed but confined to form magnons in a strong magnetic field. In the spin-orbital chain, each of the fractional quasiparticles carries both spin and <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers,</b> and the two variables are always entangled in the collective excitations. Our result further shows that the recently reported separation phenomenon occurs when crystal fields fully polarize the orbital degrees of freedom. In this case, however, the spinon and orbiton dynamics are decoupled solely because of a redefinition of the spin and <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers.</b> Comment: Original: 9 pages, 9 figures (including supplementary material); a slightly revised version w. r. t. v 2 (conclusions unchanged).

5000|$|The parity of a term symbol is {{calculated}} as where li is the <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> for each electron. [...] means even parity while [...] is for odd parity. In fact, only electrons in odd orbitals (with l odd) {{contribute to the}} total parity: an odd number of electrons in odd orbitals (those with an odd l such as in p, f,...) correspond to an odd term symbol, while an even number of electrons in odd orbitals correspond to an even term symbol. The number of electrons in even orbitals is irrelevant as any sum of even numbers is even. For any closed subshell, the number of electron is 2(2l+1) which is even, so the summation of li in closed subshell is always an even number. The summation of quantum numbers [...] over open (unfilled) subshells of odd orbitals (l odd) determines the parity of the term symbol. If the number of electrons in this reduced summation is odd (even) then the parity is also odd (even).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{instability}} of small AdS black holes with two independent rotation parameters in minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity to massless scalar perturbations. We analytically solve the Klein-Gordon equation for low-frequency perturbations in two regions of the spacetime of these black holes: namely, in the region close to the horizon and in the far-region. By matching the solutions in an intermediate region, we calculate the frequency spectrum of quasinormal modes. We show that in the regime of superradiance only the modes of even <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> undergo negative damping, resulting in exponential growth of the amplitude. That is, the black holes become unstable to these modes. Meanwhile, the modes of odd <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> do not undergo any damping, oscillating with frequency-shifts.

40|$|Progress in the {{fabrication}} of nanometer-scale electronic devices is opening new opportunities {{to uncover the}} deepest aspects of the Kondo effect, one of the paradigmatic phenomena in the physics of strongly correlated electrons. Artificial single-impurity Kondo systems have been realized in various nanostructures, including semiconductor quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and individual molecules. The Kondo effect is usually regarded as a spin-related phenomenon, namely the coherent exchange of the spin between a localized state and a Fermi sea of electrons. In principle, however, {{the role of the}} spin could be replaced by other degrees of freedom, such as an <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b> Here we demonstrate that the unique electronic structure of carbon nanotubes enables the observation of a purely orbital Kondo effect. We use a magnetic field to tune spin-polarized states into orbital degeneracy and conclude that the <b>orbital</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> is conserved during tunneling. When orbital and spin degeneracies are simultaneously present, we observe a strongly enhanced Kondo effect, with a multiple splitting of the Kondo resonance at finite field and predicted to obey a so-called SU(4) symmetry.
