5|$|Kalimpong {{is located}} off the National Highway 31A (NH31A), which links Sevok to Gangtok. The NH31A is an {{offshoot}} of the NH 31, which connects Sevok to Siliguri. These two National Highways together, via Sevok, links Kalimpong to the plains. Regular bus services and hired vehicles connect Kalimpong with Siliguri and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong, Darjeeling and Gangtok. Four wheel drives are popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the steep slopes in the region. However, road communication <b>often</b> <b>get</b> disrupted in the monsoons due to landslides. In the town, people usually travel by foot. Residents also use bicycle, two-wheelers and hired taxis for short distances.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds <b>often</b> <b>get</b> divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E
25|$|The Internet came {{to change}} the {{conditions}} for physical mail. Email (and in recent years social networking sites) became a fierce competitor to physical mail systems, but online auctions and Internet shopping opened new business opportunities as people <b>often</b> <b>get</b> items bought online through the mail.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} breeds, Shar Peis have {{increased}} risk of developing atopic dermatitis, a chronic allergic skin disease. Dogs with allergic skin disease <b>often</b> <b>get</b> allergy-induced skin infections. Shar Peis are also at {{increased risk of}} demodicosis, a disease which happens when Demodex canis mites proliferate and cause skin irritation, inflammation and infection.|$|E
25|$|Flushing The {{springer}} {{should have}} a positive flush. It should not hesitate or point when encountering game. Some field trial dogs will <b>often</b> <b>get</b> airborne during a flush. This is exciting to watch, but {{is not necessary to}} win. Most hunters prefer that their dog not flush in that style, as it can present a risk to the dog.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on August 23, 1936 in Blacksburg, Virginia. Lucas lost an eye at age 10 after it became {{infected}} due to a fight. A friend later described him as a child who would <b>often</b> <b>get</b> attention by frighteningly strange behavior. Aside from this, Lucas' mother was a prostitute who would force him to watch her have sex with clients and cross dress in public.|$|E

He is always trying to defeat Klaus on a battle, but is always the one to lose.|$|E
25|$|Human comfort levels {{must also}} be considered. Storage areas can <b>often</b> <b>get</b> away with {{slightly}} lower temperatures than display areas since they are not accessed as often, and it is most likely that those who do enter the space will {{be prepared for the}} conditions. In galleries, however, viewers must feel comfortable enough with the temperature to spend time there, otherwise the collection will simply not be viewed and lose its purpose in being on display.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas {{is known}} for extreme weather and {{frequent}} storms. A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the Great Plains and the Gulf States, Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in Tornado Alley, and as a result, {{a few of the}} most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While sufficiently far from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can <b>often</b> <b>get</b> the remnants of a tropical system, which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.|$|E

25|$|In {{association}} football, {{the award}} typically {{goes to a}} player on the winning side. Players who score a hat-trick, or goalkeepers who keep a clean sheet under resounding pressure <b>often</b> <b>get</b> the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball {{whether or not they}} are officially named man of the match. However, not all tournaments/leagues have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites/newspapers instead. In the Premier League, for example, a player will receive a small black and gold trophy, 20 centimeters in height, 6.4 centimeters in width and 6.4 centimeters in depth, for their man of the match performance.|$|E
25|$|Signal grounds {{serve as}} return paths for signals and power (at extra low voltages, less than about 50 V) within equipment, {{and on the}} signal {{interconnections}} between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return {{that acts as a}} reference for all signals. Power and signal grounds <b>often</b> <b>get</b> connected, usually through the metal case of the equipment. Designers of printed circuit boards must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.|$|E
25|$|Most rape {{research}} and reports of rape {{are limited to}} male-female forms of rape. Research on male-on-male and female-on-male rape is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender <b>often</b> <b>get</b> little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped {{to deal with this}} type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors. This could obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such sexually aggressive peers.|$|E

25|$|During {{its initial}} run, new episodes were {{uploaded}} each Friday. Episodes are filmed at Chef's home kitchen located in residential Tokyo. Because Francis's movement was {{limited by the}} high perch stool, he would <b>often</b> <b>get</b> tired and was allowed down between scenes. Francis died on November 6, 2016, {{at the age of}} 14 years and 9 months. The announcement was made to viewers in an episode on November 16, 2016. Cooking With Dog released a few new videos that were filmed while Francis was alive, featuring a stuffed toy likeness of Francis in his place. However, in the last video filmed while Francis was alive, the show announced that it would no longer continue providing regular videos and would only release occasional new content.|$|E
25|$|The workers {{carry out}} {{nearly all the}} basic work, like {{creating}} and fixing damage to the nest, getting food, and feeding the larvae. The queen's primary job is to lay eggs. When there is an active queen, workers often have undeveloped ovaries. However, when the queen is removed, 11% of workers develop mature ovaries. This is reproductive suppression under {{the power of the}} queen. If there are any eggs found that are not laid by the queen, she eats them (oophagy). Most of these eggs were likely laid by subordinates. Queens <b>often</b> <b>get</b> to rest in the central areas of the nest close to the growing larvae while subordinates and workers often position themselves in the outer areas of the nest.|$|E
25|$|That desire {{manifested}} in two attempted murders. The first happened when Jesperson was around 10 years old. He was {{friends with a}} boy named Martin, and the two would <b>often</b> <b>get</b> into trouble together. Jesperson claimed he was punished many times for things Martin had done and blamed on Jesperson. This led Jesperson to attack Martin, violently beating him until his father pulled him away. He later claimed his intention was to kill the boy. Approximately a year later, Jesperson was swimming in a lake when another boy held him under water until he blacked out. Some time later, at a public pool, Jesperson attempted to drown the boy, holding his head under water until the lifeguard pulled him away.|$|E

25|$|Galli cricket, which {{literally}} means lane cricket, {{is a type}} of {{the backyard}} cricket popular in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, except that it is often played on the busy narrow inner lanes, and sometimes even on the main roads, of the suburbs and cities, shared with pedestrians, rickshaws, vehicular traffic, cows, pets and stray animals with cacophony of sights, sounds and colors. It is often played with the soft tennis ball, improvised wickets and bat, where rules are flexible, and hitting in the air or the to the wall, specially on someone's window pane glass is considered out. Kids would <b>often</b> <b>get</b> a scolding from the neighbors whose window pane glasses are broken, thus scoring rules are designed to keep the ball on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his cricket career, {{which lasted}} from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close {{was one of}} the most charismatic and {{well-known}} cricketers. He scored almost 35,000runs as a batsman, including 52centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168wickets as a bowler, over 800catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would <b>often</b> <b>get</b> hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition is a {{condition}} that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition {{is often used to}} specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also <b>often</b> <b>get</b> infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.|$|E
