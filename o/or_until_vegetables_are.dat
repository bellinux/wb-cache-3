40|$|Background: Traditional <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} and consumed throughout Japan. Individual vegetables, including Kyo vegetables and Kaga <b>vegetables,</b> <b>are</b> individually defined {{with their own}} criteria for history and quality standards and are registered in their respective regions. Several traditional <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> utilized as symbols of regional revitalization. For example, Kaga <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> tourist attractions, and Noto <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> promoted in the Noto region and were registered under the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Methods: We will review the distribution, public standards, and definitions of dento-yasai, traditional Japanese vegetables. Quantitative analysis {{on the status of}} the branding of traditional <b>vegetables</b> will <b>be</b> conducted. Results: First, the ambiguity and distribution of traditional <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> demonstrated. Next, as a case study, the results of a quantitative analysis of Kaga vegetables and Noto <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> provided. Kaga <b>vegetables</b> have their own quality standards and definition, and producers have acknowledged the positive impact of the regional certification, GIAHS, on the amount sold. However, a social conflict has been caused by their standards and definition. On the other hand, Noto vegetables do not have a strict quality standard, and they were registered relatively recently. Because of their comparatively lax standard, producers could not acknowledge the positive impacts of GIAHS certification. Conclusion: Origins of traditional Japanese vegetables and relationships with their regions have innumerable ambiguous points. The results of the analysis of two types of traditional vegetables show that quality standards and definitions strongly influence branding and brand management...|$|R
