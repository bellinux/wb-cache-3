50|$|Many lending {{institutions}} require the borrower to repay only an interest {{component of the}} loan each month (calculated daily, and compounded to the loan once each month). The borrower can apply any surplus funds to the outstanding loan principal at any time, {{reducing the amount of}} interest calculated from that day onward. Some loan products also allow the possibility to redraw cash up to the original LTV, potentially perpetuating the life of the <b>loan</b> beyond the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> <b>term.</b>|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{mortgages}} frequently amortize {{over the}} <b>term</b> of the <b>loan,</b> meaning the borrower pays both interest and principal over time, and the loan balance {{at the end}} of the term is less than the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> amount. However, unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages generally do not fully amortize over the stated term, and therefore frequently end with a balloon payment of the remaining balance, which is often repaid by refinancing the property. Some commercial mortgages have an interest-only period at the beginning of the <b>loan</b> <b>term</b> during which time the borrower only pays interest.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} five key <b>loan</b> {{contract}} <b>terms</b> – price, collateral, maturity, covenants, and size – are jointly determined and investigates how lenders and borrowers trade these off to address information asymmetries. It further examines whether prior lending relationships affect loan covenants and size and whether borrowers with higher information asymmetries obtain better <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> from their relationship lenders. Since revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> {{differ in their}} characteristics, these issues are examined for the two loan types separately. The sample consists of 17, 636 revolving and 6, 625 <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> made by banks operating in the United States to U. S. non-financial firms from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2009. A system of five simultaneous equations is used to examine <b>loan</b> <b>term</b> jointness. It also provides coefficients for an information asymmetry proxy and a lending relationship measure to examine how <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> are used to address information asymmetries as well as whether prior lending relationships impact loan covenants and size. This model is modified by adding {{a product of the}} information asymmetry and lending relationship measures and then used to investigate if borrowers with higher information asymmetries obtain better terms from their relationship lenders. The empirical results show all five key <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> are jointly determined. For revolving loans, high information asymmetry borrowers pay higher prices, {{are more likely to be}} required to provide collateral, and accept shorter maturities in return for obtaining larger loans with fewer covenants. For <b>term</b> <b>loans,</b> such borrowers pay higher prices and are more likely to pledge collateral in return for larger loans. Those borrowers with prior lending relationships accept more covenants but obtain larger loans for both two loan types. Borrowers with higher information asymmetries, however, obtain neither lower prices nor more favourable non-price terms from their relationship lenders. This thesis makes several academic contributions. It extends other studies (e. g., Dennis, Nandy, and Sharpe, 2000) to include covenants and loan size as key <b>loan</b> contract <b>terms</b> and finds that all five <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> are jointly determined. Moreover, this study is the first to provide evidence that borrowers and lenders trade off <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> when addressing borrower information asymmetries. It is also the first to show that borrowers accept more covenants but obtain larger amounts from their relationship lenders. It augments the work of Bharath, Dahiya, Saunders, and Srinivasan (2011) by examining both price and non-price terms in a simultaneous equation model across revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> but finds no evidence that borrowers with higher information asymmetries obtain better <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> from their relationship lenders. Regarding methodology, this work extends prior studies by using a system of simultaneous equations to mitigate potential simultaneity problems, considering differences between revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> and obtaining different findings across these loan types. This study reveals the endogeneity of loan selection and addresses the problem by using the borrower GVKEY and lender RSSD ID in the sampling selection to trace back prior lending relationships, thus improving the accuracy of the results. These findings should prove of interest to academics, lenders, borrowers, and policymakers. Academics should consider the jointness of all key <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> to address their endogeneity issues. Revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> should not be pooled together in a single sample and the endogeneity of loan type selection (i. e., revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans)</b> should be also addressed. Lenders should seek to trade off different <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> and address asymmetric information problems to satisfy their borrowers but be aware that this trade-off differs, depending on loan type. Lenders can also use more loan covenants and make larger loans to their relationship borrowers due to the information obtained from their lending relationships. Borrowers with prior lending relationships have the advantage of be able to obtain larger loans from their relationship lenders but these loans can entail more covenants. Rather than just accept less favourable terms, as suggested by prior studies, borrowers with high information asymmetries may trade them for better ones; however, even lending relationships will not allow them to obtain better <b>loan</b> <b>terms,</b> except for larger <b>term</b> <b>loans,</b> from their relationship lenders. Borrowers should also be aware that lenders can set <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> differently across revolving and <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> Policymakers should avoid risk management regulations focusing only on individual specific terms and instead encourage banks to consider all <b>loan</b> contract <b>terms...</b>|$|R
