5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E

5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction.

5|$|A mass murder–suicide occurs among {{a team of}} geophysicists at an outpost in Icy Cape, Alaska.

With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, who attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects {{that it may be}} infected with bubonic plague; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on the bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E

5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct {{intelligence}} in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end {{agreed to participate in the}} Alsos Mission as a junior partner. In June 1945, Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans, and Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The house was bugged, and the conversations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> at Los Alamos {{were eager}} {{to return to their}} {{laboratories}} and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.|$|E

Z Division was created in July 1945 to control testing, stock piling, and bomb assembly activities. It was named after Jerrold R. Zacharias, its leader until 17 October 1945, when he returned to MIT, and was succeeded by Roger S. Warner. It moved to Sandia Base between March and July 1946, except for its Z-4 (Mechanical Engineering) Group, which followed in February 1947.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1942, Oliphant {{embarked}} from Melbourne, taking Rosa and {{the children}} back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French Desirade was again a slow one, {{and they did not}} reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943. But he had to leave them behind once more in November 1943 after he joined the Manhattan Project in the United States as part of the British Mission. Oliphant was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> whose services the Americans were most eager to secure, and Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade Oliphant to join. The work on the bomb itself made him uneasy, and he preferred to head the team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment– a vital but less overtly military part of the project.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E

5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms.

5|$|Back in Detroit, Sarif {{admits to}} Adam that the Illuminati {{are behind the}} attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his {{involvement}} in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists,</b> taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod {{in the wake of a}} staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientists</b> on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
