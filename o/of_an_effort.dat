5|$|To reflect its {{expansion}} beyond VoicePrint, the National Broadcast Reading Service {{was renamed}} Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) in 2010.

5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to cut costs. The move {{was not a}} popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens {{on the last day}} of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's {{submarine}} {{then returned}} to Japan, {{one of the few}} such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the court-martial of Charles B. McVay III, the commanding officer of Indianapolis, a move which was controversial at the time. He was later part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a Shinto priest. He died in 2000.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to add more options for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely seen as the product <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> by local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence Air to serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|SM U-17 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. U-17 sank an Italian destroyer in July 1916 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to disrupt the Otranto Barrage but sank no other ships during the war. The boat survived the war and was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The London Borough of Hillingdon's Hillingdon Civic Centre {{was built}} in Uxbridge High Street in 1973, as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to unite the {{services}} of the council, which had formed in 1965 with the merger of the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, Hayes and Harlington Urban District and Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. Before the new building was completed, council services had been spread throughout Uxbridge {{and the rest of}} the borough and various buildings, as a result of the merging of the former district councils.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to bring {{more attention to the}} AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> by MirCorp to {{refurbish}} and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was {{nearing the end}} of its operational life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The new World Trade Center complex will {{eventually}} include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street, {{as well as}} the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood.

5|$|U-17 {{primarily}} operated from Cattaro, patrolling off the Italian and Albanian coasts. The submarine {{had several}} opportunities to sink merchant ships and warships throughout the war, but sank only one Italian destroyer in July 1916 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to disrupt the}} Otranto Barrage. At {{the end of the}} war, U-17 was undergoing repairs at Pola. She was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to establish}} a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced to send him to the Baltimore Colts as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E
