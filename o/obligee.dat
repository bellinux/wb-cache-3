The inhabitants of Yakushima have derived great prosperity from their WH registration and are considered successful in Japan. In spite of the island’s strong economic growth due to tourism, there have been many social problems. The inhabitants, including tourist agencies and tour guides, are the primary agents of these social problems. In this paper, we explain that the causes of these social problems are rooted in a misinterpretation of the WH convention, especially the concept of ‘heritage’. We must define the meaning of ‘heritage’ and the related words in the convention. In doing this, it is necessary to introduce strictly defined legal terms from the civil law. In our civil law, the concept of ‘heritage’ is described as one concept, that is, joint-property or inheritance. Inheritance is owned jointly, and it consists of heirs and inheritance <b>obligees,</b> that is, all the peoples of the world. The inhabitants in Yakushima should recognize that they gave everyone from around the world the right to enjoy the naturale environment of their island after it was registered on the WH list...|$|R
40|$|The Bankruptcy Code {{currently}} divides divorce-related obligations {{into two}} categories: awards or agreements {{in the nature}} of support are non-dischargeable; obligations arising from property divisions can be discharged {{in the same manner as}} ordinary commercial debts. Because recent developments in family law have undermined the support/property distinction and because privately negotiated divorce agreements often fail to distinguish between payments intended to serve as support and those intended to distribute property, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on this classification often leads to confusion and hardship for divorce <b>obligees.</b> In addition, because of the rise of equitable distribution as the dominant method of allocating marital gains and losses, the policy of refusing to protect divorce-related property divisions is unfair to divorcing couples who structure their financial arrangements according to modern notions of marital partnership. Tracing the history of the marital support exemption and examining recent trends in family law, Professor Singer argues that the goals of bankruptcy law and divorce law could be better served by amending the Bankruptcy Code to exclude from discharge all divorce-related obligations. Such a rule would recognize the particular nature of financial commitments arising out of marriage, and allow the Code to conform with our modern understanding of the marriage relationship...|$|R
6000|$|... § 5. Among active {{states of}} mind, there is, however, one species which merits {{particular}} attention, because {{it forms a}} principal part of the connotation of some important classes of names. I mean volitions, or acts of the will. When we speak of sentient beings by relative names, {{a large portion of}} the connotation of the name usually consists of the actions of those beings; actions past, present, and possible or probable future. Take, for instance, the words Sovereign and Subject. What meaning do these words convey, but that of innumerable actions, done or to be done by the sovereign and the subjects, to or in regard to one another reciprocally? So with the words physician and patient, leader and follower, tutor and pupil. In many cases the words also connote actions which would be done under certain contingencies by persons other than those denoted: as the words mortgagor and mortgagee, obligor and <b>obligee,</b> and many other words expressive of legal relation, which connote what a court of justice would do to enforce the legal obligation if not fulfilled. There are also words which connote actions previously done by persons other than those denoted either by the name itself or by its correlative; as the word brother. From these instances, it may be seen how large a portion of the connotation of names consists of actions. Now what is an action? Not one thing, but a series of two things: the state of mind called a volition, followed by an effect. The volition or intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action. I form the purpose of instantly moving my arm; that is a state of my mind: my arm (not being tied or paralytic) moves in obedience to my purpose; that is a physical fact, consequent on a state of mind. The intention, followed by the fact, or (if we prefer the expression) the fact when preceded and caused by the intention, is called the action of moving my arm.|$|E

This analysis tracks the divergent approaches to enforcing support for women who received welfare and women who did not, through the mid- 1980 s. It then describes the movement for clientele unification. This unification movement was driven from the bottom up, with middle-class, grassroots organizations demanding change. They found a particularly re-ceptive audience of women politicians and a Reagan administration seeking a second term in office. The clientele merger altered the fundamental character of the child support enforcement program. The child support enforcement program {{is one of the}} most popular social policy initiatives in the United States. The general public views this federal-state partnership, which helps establish paternity, initiate orders, and enforce these orders, as an essential means of holding fa-thers accountable for their offspring.

40|$|De zoektocht naar transnationaal gezag. De anti-apartheidsbewegingen in de Europese Gemeenschap De anti-apartheidsbeweging is wijd erkend als een belangrijke mondiale actor uit de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw. Dit artikel levert een bijdrage tot recente inspanningen om anti-apartheid te begrijpen als een trans{{nationale}} sociale beweging. De aandacht gaat vooral naar de anti-apartheidsorganisaties in de landen van de Europese Gemeenschap (eg) en hun pogingen om het besluitvormingsproces van nationale overheden te beïnvloeden. Het eg-proces van samenwerking rond buitenlands beleid, zo wordt betoogd, vormde een ernstige beperking op lobbyactiviteiten die gericht waren op het nationale niveau. Anti-apartheidsorganisaties voelden zich dan ook genoodzaakt om hun activiteiten op een transnationaal niveau te coördineren. Dit bereikte een hoogtepunt met de oprichting van de Liaison Group of National Anti-Apartheid Movements in the Countries of the European Community. The Quest for Transnational Authority. The Anti-Apartheid Movements of the European Community The {{anti-apartheid movement}} has been widely recognized as an important global actor {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. This article makes a contribution to recent efforts to understand anti-apartheid as a transnational social movement. Its primary focus lies with the anti-apartheid organizations in the countries of the European Community (ec) and their attempts to influence the decision making of their national governments. The ec process of foreign policy cooperation, it is argued, offered a serious constraint to lobbying activities geared at the national level. Antiapartheid organizations therefore felt compelled to coordinate their activities at a transnational level. This culminated in the creation of the Liaison Group of National Anti-Apartheid Movements in the Countries of the European Community. La quête de l’autorité transnationale. Les mouvements anti-apartheid dans la Communauté européenne Le mouvement anti-apartheid est largement reconnu comme un acteur mondial important dans la seconde moitié du xxe siècle. Cet article étudie ce mouvement en tant que mouvement social transnational. L’accent est mis sur les organisations anti-apartheid dans les pays de la Communauté européenne et leurs tentatives pour influencer les décisions de leurs gouvernements nationaux. D’après l’auteur, le processus de coopération européenne concernant la politique étrangère entravait le lobbying à l’échelon national. Par conséquent, les organisations anti-apartheid se sentaient <b>obligées</b> de coordonner leurs activités au niveau transnational.

40|$|Avec cette thèse de doctorat nous proposons une réflexion transversale {{concernant}} les relations entre infrastructures de transport et développement territorial dans des espaces dits « intermédiaires ». Le concept d'espace intermédiaire, relativement nouveau en géographie, est conçu {{en fonction}} d'une double approche : celle des infrastructures où les espaces intermédiaires constituent des zones de transit <b>obligées</b> entre des pôles urbains hiérarchiquement supérieurs (par rapport une échelle horizontale) et celle des frontières où les espaces intermédiaires constituent des territoires de coopération entre différents niveaux politico-institutionnels (par rapport à une échelle verticale). Cette problématique de recherche est traitée aussi bien du point de vue théorique qu'avec des études de cas portant sur les effets des nouvelles infrastructures de transports dans la région transfrontalière insubrique (entre le Canton du Tessin et la Lombardie). L'objectif visé est de défendre un scénario d'organisation spatiale polycentrique à plusieurs niveaux comme solution pour le développement durable et cohérent de ces espaces intermédiaires. Ainsi, pour le « niveau macro », nous proposons une analyse des changements d'accessibilité spatiale et des potentiels de développement territorial pour les agglomérations concernées par la mise en service du nouveau tunnel ferroviaire de base du Monte Ceneri (TBC) et de la nouvelle ligne Lugano/Como-Mendrisio-Varese-Malpensa (FMV) à l'horizon 2020. Pour le « niveau meso », nous analysons les effets de la nouvelle ligne FMV en termes de potentiel de densification polycentrique autours des gares ferroviaires. Pour le « niveau micro », nous proposons une analyse sur les comportements de mobilité ainsi que des améliorations ciblées du système de transport pour la ville de Mendrisio visant à promouvoir le développement polycentrique de cette commune. De plus, un système d'analyse permettant de mettre en lien les divers facteurs explicatifs dans l'analyse des relations entre les nouvelles infrastructures de transport et les effets sur la mobilité et le développement territorial est également élaboré et testé dans notre recherche.

This research pursues the goal of defending the argument that a multi-level polycentric spatial scenario can be a possible solution fora sustainable development of the above described in- between areas.
