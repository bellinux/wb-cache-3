5|$|The fall <b>of</b> <b>Atlanta</b> and {{the success}} of the overall Atlanta Campaign were {{extensively}} covered by Northern newspapers, and were a boon to Northern morale and to President Lincoln's political standing.

The capture <b>of</b> <b>Atlanta</b> and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce.
