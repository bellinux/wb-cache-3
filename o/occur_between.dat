5000|$|Capacitance <b>occurs</b> <b>between</b> any two {{conductors}} {{separated by}} an insulator. In an audio cable, capacitance <b>occurs</b> <b>between</b> the cable's two conductors; the resulting losses are called [...] "dielectric losses" [...] or [...] "dielectric absorption". Capacitance also <b>occurs</b> <b>between</b> the cable's conductors and any nearby conductive objects, including house wiring and damp foundation concrete; {{this is called}} [...] "stray capacitance".|$|R
5000|$|Competitive versus Cooperative. A {{competitive}} plan conflict <b>occurs</b> <b>between</b> actors, each {{of which}} benefit by preventing the other's success. A cooperative plan conflict <b>occurs</b> <b>between</b> actors who benefit from each other's success.|$|R
5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, sound more like voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> two vowels.|$|E
5|$|The mean annual {{temperatures}} in the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley range from , depending on altitude. In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province, the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long summers, and a long frost free period which varies by altitude. In both the Quebrada de Humahuaca and Calchaquí valleys, winters are cold with frosts that can <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> March and September.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} tropical, typical of medium {{elevation}}s, with the dry {{period of the}} year <b>occurring</b> <b>between</b> July and October and the wet period <b>occurring</b> <b>between</b> November and March. The average elevation is 800 meters above sea level.|$|R

5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> {{two or more}} pairs {{before the}} original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|C# is more type safe than C++. The only {{implicit}} conversions {{by default}} {{are those that}} are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E

5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} {{the office is}} vacant, the {{election}} to replace the president must <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections must occur before {{the last two months}} of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the House of Representatives. The last round of presidential elections occurred in 2015. President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E

5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans live a more solitary {{lifestyle}} {{than the}} other great apes. Most social bonds <b>occur</b> <b>between</b> adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents of both sexes tend to live alone. Orangutan societies {{are made up of}} resident and transient individuals of both sexes. Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the home range of a resident male, who is their main mating partner.|$|E
