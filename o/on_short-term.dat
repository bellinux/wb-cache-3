5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{worked in}} the family {{business}} but returned to football in March 2006, with Rotherham United. He did not play for Rotherham in two months and instead returned to Mansfield Town, along with his brother, Rory, {{at the end of}} the season. Boulding scored just six goals in his first season with Mansfield. However, after he scored 25 in his second season, when the team were relegated from The Football League, he attracted interest from a number of League One and Two clubs. He eventually decided to join Bradford City, again with his brother, but the pair were released early from their contracts after less than two years with the club. The brothers were given trials back at Mansfield Town, but while Rory joined Accrington Stanley, Michael returned to Barnsley <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> deal and later had a similar contract at Derby County but never featured in either first team. He has also been involved with running the family's property business.|$|E
5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E

25|$|Thirty {{of these}} four-car units were ordered by South West Trains in 1998, to create extra {{capacity}} and to replace {{some of the}} ageing Class 411 (4-CEP) trains, {{which at the time}} were <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> lease. Deliveries of these trains began in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Deregulation {{would ensure}} that rates {{would no longer be}} based on {{long-term}} average costs, as determined by a central regulating entity, to pricing based <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> marginal costs. A plant's marginal cost varies considerably based on age, technology, fuel conversion efficiency, and so on. Both regulated and deregulated systems operate to minimize the avoidable costs of meeting instantaneous demand.|$|E
25|$|Though lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy (LIS) {{is considered}} safe <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> basis, {{there are concerns}} about its long-term safety. Pankaj Garg et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis in which they analyzed the long-term continence disturbance {{two years after the}} LIS procedure. They found the incidence of long-term continence disturbance to be 14%, so caution and careful patient selection are needed before undergoing LIS.|$|E
25|$|Most Coast Guard ships {{have been}} leased instead of owned. This was a {{continuation}} of the practice of the Military Fisheries Surveillance. At first, these were issued <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> contracts, but from 1994 ten-year contracts were used instead. As part of this arrangement two new major ships were built, Ålesund and Tromsø. They were built based on specifications from the Coast Guard and included equipment for handling oil spills.|$|E

25|$|Manitoba Hydro's {{mandate to}} serve {{dictates}} that it builds enough transmission and generating firm capacity {{to serve the}} Manitoba home market first. However, in a typical year, more energy is available than the firm capacity. This can be economically exported from the Province. Since this energy is typically sold <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> contracts or even on a spot market, the returns on these sales increase Manitoba Hydro's retained earnings, allowing domestic rates to be stable and low.|$|E
25|$|Military {{personnel}} {{are now being}} supplemented by more civilians filling essential roles, {{and the introduction of}} large megabases that intermesh different service branches and their individual cultures has also affected the demographics. Finally, during the post-Cold War period, the United States has been involved in three extended military engagements (two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan). The long-term effects of these changes are unknown, but research has been conducted <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> effects on post-Cold War-era brats.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix was a {{merchant}} ship launched on the Thames in 1790. She made one voyage {{as an extra}} ship (i.e., <b>on</b> <b>short-term</b> charter), for the British East India Company (EIC). Before that she had several masters and sailed under letters of marque. These authorized the vessel's master to engage in offensive action against the French, should the occasion arise, not just defend herself. After the voyage for the EIC Phoenix apparently traded as a West Indiaman until she was condemned in 1812.|$|E
