40|$|International audienceIn Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), service {{contracts}} {{are widely used}} for designing and developing the features (e. g., services and capabilities) of Service Providers (SPs). Two {{of the most widely}} used traditional {{service contracts}} in SOA are: WSDL and WADL. We identify that these service contracts suffer from several problems, like: they only work for SOAP and REST communication technologies and do not rely on model-ing SOA Design Patterns (DPs). One benefit of using SOA DPs is that they permit developing proven SPs for different platforms. In order to overcome these problems, we introduce a new DP-based Feature Model (FM), named F MSP, as a service contract that models the variability of SP features including 15 SOA DPs (e. g., Event-driven messaging DP) and their corresponding constraints. This permits to easily identify and develop valid SOA compound DPs. We demonstrate, through a practical case study and a developed tool, that <b>our</b> <b>F</b> MSP allows to automatically generate fully functional, valid, highly customized and DP-based SPs. We also show that <b>our</b> <b>F</b> MSP reduces the required effort and time to develop SPs...|$|E

40|$|In the {{interest}} of understanding the genetic basis of adaption to environment, we developed F 2 lines from an F 1 interspecific cross between the rare serpentine endemic, Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. barbarae and the non-serpentine Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. amplexicaulis. Using genomic DNA from Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. barbarae, we developed a suite of microsatellite markers. In addition, we developed gene specific markers for genes known in Arabidopsis to be ecologically important. Our suite of markers was used to genotype 186 F 2 plants, the basis for <b>our</b> <b>F</b> 2 linkage map. In order to further resolve evolutionary relationships among related taxa, we constructed a molecular phylogeny for 52 taxa within the related genera Caulanthus, Guillenia, Sibaropsis, Streptanthella, and Streptanthus, using the sequences from the ribosomal ITS region and two chloroplast regions. To create a useful system to enable comparative genomics within the related taxa of the ecologically and morphologically diverse Streptanthoid Complex, we demonstrated that our molecular tools are portable across {{a large group of}} ecologically significant taxa. To use the significant genomic resources available in Arabidopsis, we constructed a collinear comparative map of Caulanthus and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana based on ancestral linkage blocks with the Brassicaceae family. This comparative map acted as a guide for candidate gene selection in the mapping of sepal color. We identified a region of MYB transcription factors in an orthologous region of Arabidopsis. Sequence data from Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. barbarae and Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. amplexicaulis in this MYB region showed significant sequence divergence between the two taxa. To determine the genetic basis for the tolerance of high concentrations of magnesium in Caulanthus amplexicaulis var. barbarae, we phenotyped multiple individuals from 88 F 2 : 3 families under two nutrient treatments, differing in the ratio of calcium to magnesium. Through QTL analysis, using <b>our</b> <b>F</b> 2 linkage map as a framework for the analysis, we identified one major effect QTL on Caulanthus Linkage Group 8 and another QTL on Caulanthus Linkage Group 3.

40|$|Abstract — Maintaining an {{acceptable}} level of network performance degradation {{in the presence of}} faults has been an active research area in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper proposes a scheme to optimize the total network performance by exploiting fault-aware rate control and multi-path routing in WSNs. We use statistical information and estimation on each wireless link to characterize the effect of faults, and develop a leaky-path model. This model takes account of packet loss along fault-paths and the “shrinking ” feature of effective flow at the destination node. Based on the leaky-path model, we propose a fault-correlated flow control and routing ((F C) 2 R) approach to maximize the network utility of effective flows. A novel distributed algorithm is designed to adjust flow rates adaptively on each path, using multi-path routing. Our simulation results demonstrate that higher effective network throughput, and better fairness, can be achieved by <b>our</b> ((<b>F</b> C) 2 R) algorithm than the standard optimal flow control in the presence of faults.

The discussions on standardization within the World Wide Web Consortium proceed very fast and a standard query language will be soon chosen and made available [1]. Sophisticated query engines, that allow user to deal with semi-structured data, will be crucial to exploiting the full power of XML. On the other side, traditional query engines are being used in practice for processing XML documents conforming to DTDs: translators of XML queries to SQL queries over tables are likely to be eective in most cases.
