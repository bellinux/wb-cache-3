5|$|As of 2017, Matt {{is heavily}} {{involved}} with <b>OMEGA</b> in various on–screen and behind–the–scenes roles, most notably being a two–time and current <b>OMEGA</b> Heavyweight Champion, a two–time and current <b>OMEGA</b> Tag Team Champion (both with Jeff) and the promotions main booker.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny <b>Omega</b> of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed <b>Omega</b> to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on <b>Omega</b> later in the match. <b>Omega</b> {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of Z mode waves by diffuse auroral electron precipitation is investigated assuming that a loss cone {{exists in the}} upgoing portion of the distribution due to electron interactions with the atmosphere. The waves are generated at frequencies above, but very near, the local electron cyclotron frequency <b>omega(e)</b> and at wave normal angles larger than 90 deg. In agreement with Hewitt et al. (1983), the group velocity is directed downward in regions where {{the ratio of the}} upper hybrid frequency omega(pe) to <b>Omega(e)</b> is less than 0. 5, so that Z mode waves excited above a satellite propagate toward it and away from the upper hybrid resonance. Z mode waves are excited in a frequency band between <b>Omega(e)</b> and about 1. 02 <b>Omega(e),</b> and with maximum growth rates of about 0. 001 <b>Omega(e).</b> The amplification length is about 100 km, which allows Z mode waves to grow to the intensities observed by high-altitude satellites...|$|R
50|$|Later in the semester, at the <b>Omega's</b> Spring Formal, Hodges {{declares}} Pledge {{the candidate}} {{to succeed him}} as President of the Omegas. The <b>Omega's</b> hadn't lost a Greek Board election in almost a century, but Rico (played by Joseph Booton), {{the leader of the}} Phi Tau Tau's, creates a campaign slandering the <b>Omega's,</b> stating that they kidnapped the baby. Rico and Pledge's presidential contest culminates at the Greek Board debate where Pledge presents a paternity test to President Dumervile stating who the real father of the baby is.|$|R

5|$|Now activated, <b>Omega</b> Supreme pursues Megatron and his minions relentlessly. Megatron, Soundwave and Breakdown {{devise a}} plan to lure <b>Omega</b> Supreme to a rooftop defended with turrets, where the giant Transformer is ambushed. <b>Omega</b> Supreme sustains heavy damage and plummets to Cybertron's lower levels. The Decepticons follow <b>Omega</b> Supreme and engage him in a lengthy final battle, in which <b>Omega</b> Supreme is finally defeated, {{infected}} with Dark Energon, and captured by the Decepticons. Megatron forces <b>Omega</b> Supreme {{to open the door}} to Cybertron's core and travels there with his minions. Upon arrival he infects the core of Cybertron, also a Transformer, with Dark Energon, which then begins to spread over the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2017, <b>OMEGA</b> {{announced}} it would crown its first tag team champions since 1999, which occurred four days later on January 29, when The Hardys won the <b>OMEGA</b> Tag Team Championships.|$|E
5|$|While the WRO {{continues}} {{to fight the}} remnants of Deepground, Vincent transforms into Chaos {{in a desperate attempt}} to defeat <b>Omega</b> Weiss. Shelke dives inside <b>Omega</b> to find Lucrecia's Protomateria, and upon finding it, she gives it to Vincent, also telling him that his survival made Lucrecia happy. Vincent then takes control of Chaos and battles <b>Omega.</b> <b>Omega</b> sprouts wings and tries to ascend from the planet, but Vincent manages to destroy it, disappearing in the process. A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave. He states that both Chaos and <b>Omega</b> have returned to the Planet, and he thanks Lucrecia for being the reason he survived. He is then found by Shelke outside the cave, and she tells him that everyone else is waiting for him.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Galvatron {{emerges from}} the Dead Universe, destroys an alien {{observatory}} and crushes Hound's unit on Cybertron to retrieve the body of Thunderwing. While unconscious during his battle with Megatron, Prime encountered the presence of Nova Prime, and he meets with Nova's once-associate, <b>Omega</b> Supreme. Monstructor escapes his prison and seeks revenge against <b>Omega.</b> He finds <b>Omega</b> along with Prime, and after battling him, Prime leaves Monstructor to be tended by Jetfire. Elsewhere, Blaster's body is recovered from space. After more assassination attempts he discovers the traitor is an unwilling Beachcomber, controlled by Soundwave and Bombshell's cerebro shell. Angry, he vows to hunt down Soundwave.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to <b>OMEGA</b> Championship Wrestling, or simply <b>OMEGA),</b> in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in <b>OMEGA.</b> The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many <b>OMEGA</b> wrestlers.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the verge}} of losing their baby due to bankruptcy, Pledge, a {{freshman}} fraternity member, suggests that the <b>Omega's</b> throw a party to raise funds. Despite Phi Tau Tau, the rival fraternities best attempt to ruin the party, the <b>Omega's</b> raise the funds necessary to keep Kegston only to be hit {{with the news that}} no non-students can live in Greek housing. This leads Hodges, along with his fraternity brothers Night Train, 39, and Renato to visit President Dumervile (played by Mindy Sterling). Despite schmoozing the President {{to the best of their}} abilities, President Dumervile informs the <b>Omega's</b> that it is too late in the year for her to make any changes, and that [...] "rules are rules".|$|R

In 2013, Helms returned to the revived <b>OMEGA,</b> now called <b>OMEGA</b> Championship Wrestling, and on October 12, he defeated Shane Williams to advance in a tournament for the <b>OMEGA</b> Championship. On November 16, 2013, Helms was defeated by Chris Hero at a Pro Wrestling Syndicate event.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Wrestle Kingdom 11, <b>Omega</b> looked for {{another shot at}} the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but his plan of obtaining one through the 2017 New Japan Cup was derailed, when he was eliminated in his first round match by Tomohiro Ishii. After defeating Ishii in a rematch on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2017, <b>Omega</b> was nominated by Kazuchika Okada for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship rematch at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall. On June 11 at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, The Young Bucks defeated Roppongi Vice to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship for the sixth time. Later that same event, Guerrillas of Destiny defeated War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. In the main event of the show, <b>Omega</b> and Okada wrestled to a 60-minute time limit draw for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The match also started a storyline, where <b>Omega</b> and Cody began having problems with each other with Cody wanting to {{throw in the towel}} for <b>Omega,</b> insisting he was too badly injured. On June 23 at Best in the World, Cody defeated Christopher Daniels to bring the ROH World Championship back to Bullet Club. On July 1, during the first night of G1 Special in USA, Guerrillas of Destiny lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to War Machine in a no disqualification match. In the main event of the show, Cody unsuccessfully challenged Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. During the match, <b>Omega,</b> playing off what had happened at Dominion, walked out, wanting to throw in the towel for Cody, which led to Cody confronting him after the show. The following day, <b>Omega</b> defeated Tomohiro Ishii in the finals of an eight-man tournament to become the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Moore befriended Matt and Jeff Hardy as a child, {{and they}} later trained him to wrestle. He debuted in 1995, and competed for several North Carolina-based promotions, winning several Light Heavyweight Championships. He also {{wrestled}} for The Hardy Boyz' promotion, Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (<b>OMEGA),</b> where {{he won the}} <b>OMEGA</b> Light Heavyweight Championship twice and the <b>OMEGA</b> New Frontiers Championship once. In 1999, he signed with WCW, and became part of 3 Count, a boy band parody. The three members of 3 Count jointly won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000. In 2001, he briefly held the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship with Shane Helms.|$|E

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that relativistic effects can significantly modify the wave dispersion in auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), even for only mildly relativistic electrons, when {{the ratio of}} the square of the electron plasma frequeny omega(pe) to the square of the electron cyclotron frequency <b>Omega(e)</b> is much less than one, which is frequently the case in the AKR source region. The k-parallel dispersion relation for waves in a relativistic Maxwellian plasma is considered for the case of omega(pe) much less than <b>Omega(e).</b> The results of Shkarovsky (1966) are used to evaluate the relativistic corrections to the R-X mode cutoff. The general relativistic dispersion tensor is applied to evaluate the dispersion relation for a delta function ring distribution in p-perpendicular, again assuming omega(pe) much less than <b>Omega(e).</b> The effect of finite velocity spread is studied by analyzing the Dory-Guest-Harris distribution in the semirelativistic approximation. The results of computer simulations for ring and shell distributions are presented...|$|R
5|$|The main {{production}} company behind Audition was the Japanese company <b>Omega</b> Project. <b>Omega</b> were originally behind {{the production of}} Hideo Nakata's film Ring; {{this was a great}} success in Japan and, subsequently, the rest of Asia. <b>Omega</b> had problems setting up the release of Ring in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of the Ring. The following year, in 1998, <b>Omega</b> partnered again with AFDF Korea and other production companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami's 1997 novel Audition. <b>Omega</b> wanted to create a film different than supernatural-themed Ring, and chose to adapt Murakami's novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known for working on horror films. Prior to Audition, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father (Shohei Imamura) on The Eel, which won the Palme d'Or in 1997.|$|E

40|$|The plasma {{conditions}} and {{features of the}} energetic electron distribution in electron cyclotron maser emission for which growth in a particular mode is favored when {{the ratio of the}} plasma frequency omega(p) to the electron cyclotron frequency <b>Omega(e)</b> is greater than about 0. 3 are determined. It is shown that growth at the fundamental is suppressed as omega(p) /Omega(e) increases and emission at harmonics of <b>Omega(e)</b> dominates. Growth at harmonics of <b>Omega(e)</b> is not restricted to the O and X modes, but can also occur for the Z mode. Whether or not growth in a particular mode dominates depends both on omega(p) /Omega(e) and on the form of the distribution. If the density of the energetic electrons is sufficiently large, the dispersion relations of the O and X modes are modified so that the group velocities of the growing O and X mode waves can be comparable to that of the growing Z mode waves...|$|R
