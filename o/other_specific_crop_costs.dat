25|$|The {{biological}} production of hydrogen fuel {{has been a}} topic of research {{since at least the}} 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and <b>other</b> <b>specific</b> agricultural <b>crops.</b> Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called gasification, where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by pyrolysis, a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control. Another source for {{biological production}} of hydrogen fuel is algae. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Experimental algae farms are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.|$|R

40|$|Mapping a <b>specific</b> <b>crop</b> using {{single date}} multi-spectral imagery remains a {{challenging}} task because vegetation spectral responses are considerably similar. The use of multi-temporal images helps to discriminate <b>specific</b> <b>crops</b> as the classifier can {{make use of}} the uniqueness in the temporal evolution of the spectral responses of the different vegetated classes. However, one major concern in multi-temporal studies is the selection of optimum dates for the discrimination of crops as the use of all available temporal dates can be counterproductive. In this study this concern was addressed by selecting the best 2, 3, 4 … combinations dates. This was done by conducting a separability analysis between the spectral response of the class of interest (here, sugarcane-ratoon) and non-interest classes. For this analysis, we used time series LISS-III and AWiFS sensors data that were classified using Possibilistic c-Means (PCM). This fuzzy classifier can extract single class sub-pixel information. The end result of this study was the detection of best (optimum) temporal dates for discriminating a <b>specific</b> <b>crop,</b> sugarcane-ratoon. An accuracy of 92. 8 % was achieved for extracting ratoon crop using AWiFS data whereas the optimum temporal LISS-III data provided a least entropy of 0. 437.

50|$|The third {{principle}} is {{the practice of}} crop rotation with more than two species. According to {{an article published in}} the Physiological Transactions of the Royal Society called “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture,” crop rotation can be used best as a disease control against other preferred crops (Hobbs et al. 2007). This process will not allow pests such as insects and weeds to be set into a rotation with <b>specific</b> <b>crops.</b> Rotational crops will act as a natural insecticide and herbicide against <b>specific</b> <b>crops.</b> Not allowing insects or weeds to establish a pattern will help to eliminate problems with yield reduction and infestations within fields (FAO 2007). Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration (Hobbs et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Defining {{irrigation}} volumes {{and timing}} under slight or moderate water stress conditions requires {{to monitor the}} water status in the soil–crop system and identify indicators to guide irrigation scheduling. Leaf water potential (LWP) is a commonly used variable to describe crop water status and, when measured at pre-dawn or mid-day, is an indicator of any instantaneous crop water stress condition. Even if leaf water potential measurements are {{considered one of the}} most reliable methods for direct determinations of crop water status, these determinations are destructive and time consuming and require skillful operators. Agro-hydrological models can be considered an easyto-use tool for indirect determination of soil and crop water status, as well as to estimate other parameters related to crop development. However, the application of these models requires the preliminary calibration and validation of the algorithms used for the different processes occurring in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum. Therefore, a reasonable use of the models to predict crop water stress conditions should be based on site-specific experimental investigations and requires an improvement of sub-models related to the <b>specific</b> <b>crop</b> response to changes in soil water deficit. Several models have been proposed to quantify the water stress coefficient as linear or nonlinear functions of soil water status, expressed in terms of matric potential or soil water depletion. For a certain crop, the water stress function is applied once it is known its shape and the thresholds values identifying the soil water status beyond which crop water stress occurs and the level of maximum stress. This review aims to demonstrate how the use of agrohydrological models is able to predict the water stress dynamics of two important Mediterranean tree crops (olive and citrus), which have a different eco-physiological water stress response to soil water deficit conditions. After examining the eco-physiological response of both crops to soil water deficit, we assessed the potential of FAO- 56 agro-hydrological model to identify crop water stress under different irrigation management strategies. The proposed the water stress functions are the result of recent experiments based on long term series of field measurements of soil (volumetric water content) and plant (xylem water potential and transpiration flows) water status of olive and citrus trees. Experiments carried out during three years in a Sicilian olive grove and a Valencian citrus orchard allowed to identify the <b>specific</b> <b>crop</b> water stress response to soil water deficit conditions and confirm for citrus the original schematization proposed in FAO- 56 paper. Moreover, after evaluating the similarity between the measured midday stem water potential using the simulated crop water stress coefficient, the fairly good performance of FAO- 56 agro-hydrological model to predict soil water content was proven. The obtained results evidenced that the crop water stress coefficient estimated by the model is used as a suitable indicator to replace the tedious and time-consuming field measurements of midday stem water potential. On the <b>other</b> side, when <b>specific</b> <b>crop</b> water stress function are implemented, the FAO- 56 agrohydrological model can predict soil water content and the crop water requirement, even when water saving strategies are used...|$|R
