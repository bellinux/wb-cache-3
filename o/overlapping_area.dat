2500|$|In 1606, {{shortly before}} {{colonization}} began, James I of England granted the Charter of 1606 {{to the newly}} established Virginia Company, asserting royal title to Native American-occupied land between the 34th and 45th latitudes and [...] inland, and permitting the Virginia Company to establish colonies there. The Virginia Company's subsidiary, the Plymouth Company, was given title to land between the 38th and 45th parallel, while another subsidiary, the London Company, was given title to land between the 34th and 41st parallels. The charter created a conflicting title to the <b>overlapping</b> <b>area</b> between the 38th and 41st parallels, but since no colonies were planned for the area the conflict did not initially create problems. In 1609, James I redefined the Colony of Virginia's boundaries so that the northern boundary projected northwest from the coast, as well as asserting title to all land west to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

40|$|<b>Overlap</b> <b>areas</b> between encinal and pinyon-juniper {{woodlands}} {{on three}} mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona were studied {{in terms of}} selected physiographic (slope, aspect, soil coarse fragments, and soil pH) and vegetative (overstory number of stems, basal area, volume; regeneration counts and stocking) variables. <b>Overlap</b> <b>areas,</b> defined arbitrarily in this study, were those areas where oak and pinyon-juniper types mix in space, but, basal area per acre of one species group must not have equaled nor exceeded 80 {{percent of the total}} basal area recorded at the area. The {{purpose of the study was}} to find and describe factors and relationships that might account for the occurrences of <b>overlap</b> <b>areas.</b> Findings of the study might be used by natural resource managers to better understand and manage these important woodlands, including the <b>overlap</b> <b>area.</b> Slope and aspect, although not critical factors in the occurrence of <b>overlap</b> <b>areas,</b> must be carefully considered before harvesting trees on warm and steep sites because juniper is known to have higher tolerance for xeric conditions than oak. Hence, tree harvesting operations in <b>overlap</b> <b>areas</b> located on warm, steep slopes might induce the dominance of pinyon-juniper over oak in the <b>area.</b> <b>Overlap</b> <b>areas</b> were stonier at the soil surface than encinal and pinyon-juniper types. If a field manager wanted an <b>overlap</b> <b>area</b> to re-establish itself after tree harvesting operations, then he must look for <b>overlap</b> <b>areas</b> with stony to very stony soil surfaces. Basal area and volume of oak in <b>overlap</b> <b>areas</b> appeared to dominate over those of pinyon-juniper at some study areas. Oak trees apparently were more mature and established than pinyon-juniper trees in the <b>overlap</b> <b>areas.</b> The smaller and perhaps younger pinyon-juniper trees might indicate recent occupation of the area. It should be noted, however, that data from which this inference was based upon involved no long-term tree measurements. Regeneration of oak generally was more abundant than that of pinyon-juniper in the <b>overlap</b> <b>area.</b> If sheer numbers of plantlets or stocking would indicate eventual establishment and dominance of a species in the <b>overlap</b> <b>area</b> at a given time, then oaks might dominate over pinyon-juniper in time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel ICP variant {{that uses a}} {{histogram}} in conjunction with multiple closest points to detect the <b>overlap</b> <b>area</b> between range images geing registered. Tentative correspondences sharing similar distances are normally all within, or all outside, the <b>overlap</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, the <b>overlap</b> <b>area</b> can be detected in a bin by bin batch manner using a histogram. Using multiple closest points is likely to enlarge the distance difference for tentative correspondences in the histogram, and pull together the images being registered, facilitating the <b>overlap</b> <b>area</b> detection. Our experimental results based on real range images show that the performance of our proposed algorithm enhances {{the state of the}} art. ...|$|R
