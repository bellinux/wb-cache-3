5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out {{the negative consequences of}} uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back to}} 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E
