5|$|Early worship {{took place}} at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements. In the 16th century, it was {{converted}} into a dungeon, and was later demolished in 1779. In 1634–35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened a chapel of ease, which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel <b>of</b> <b>Sacred</b> Trinity (the parish <b>of</b> <b>Sacred</b> Trinity was created in 1650). John Wesley preached in the building, before his break with the Anglican Church. Upon his return in 1747 however he preached in the open, at Salford Cross. The chapel was rebuilt in about 1752–53, although the tower probably belonged to the original building. It was restored in 1871–74 by the architect J. P. Holden and a chapel was added to the south-east in 1934. It is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E

5|$|Josquin wrote {{towards the}} end of the period in which the mass was the {{predominant}} form <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> composition in Europe. The mass, as it had developed through the 15th century, was a long, multi-section form, with opportunities for large-scale structure and organization not possible in the other forms such as the motet. Josquin wrote some of the most famous examples of the genre, most using some kind of cyclic organization.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} young adults’ {{perspectives on the}} concept <b>of</b> the <b>sacred.</b> Altogether, 334 young Finnish adults aged 19 – 35 were studied through a self-report questionnaire. The participants’ personal conceptions, reflections and experiences <b>of</b> the <b>sacred</b> were assessed with open-ended questions. Answers were classified in a data-determined content analysis using a thematic analytical approach. In addition, the {{study examined}} how these understandings <b>of</b> the <b>sacred</b> were related to subjective religiosity and how the definitions vary across gender. The {{findings suggest that the}} conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>sacred</b> mainly concentrate on individuality and personal issues, including personal opinion, rest and peace, but also close social relationships and the church as an institution. By differentiating the conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>sacred,</b> this study reflects cultural interpretations <b>of</b> what the <b>sacred</b> means and integrates the concept in the theory of young adulthood as a life course phase and in the sociology of youth...|$|R

5|$|Josquin's mature style evolved {{during this}} period; as in Milan he had absorbed the {{influence}} of light Italian secular music, in Rome he refined his techniques <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> music. Several of his motets have been dated to the years he spent at the papal chapel.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. It has been argued that St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E

5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first, but iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile plot against him involving {{some of the highest}} civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E

5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> architecture of the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. The {{followers}} of Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, {{there is evidence that}} Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume <b>of</b> <b>Sacred</b> Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|The main {{development}} of organ repertoire has progressed {{along with that}} of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because organs are commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ repertoire includes a large amount <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for alternatim use, etc.). The organ's secular repertoire includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.|$|E

5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E

A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines <b>of</b> <b>sacred</b> ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
