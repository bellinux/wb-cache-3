25|$|The play {{opens with}} Wong, a water seller, {{explaining}} {{to the audience}} that {{he is on the}} city outskirts awaiting the foretold appearance of several important gods. Soon the gods arrive and ask Wong to find them shelter for the night. They are tired, having travelled far and wide in search <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> who still live according to the principles that they, the gods, have handed down. Instead they have found only greed, evil, dishonesty, and selfishness. The same turns out to be true in Szechwan: no one will take them in, no one has the time or means to care for others – no one except the poor young prostitute Shen Teh, whose pure inherent charity cannot allow her to turn away anyone in need. Shen Teh was going to see a customer, but decides to help out instead; however confusion follows leaving Wang fleeing from the illustrious Ones, leaving his water carrying pole behind.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{travel to}} Ti'atha Forest where they {{encounter}} {{the spirit of}} Kisala's father, King Albioth (Fred Tatasciore). Albioth had faced Mother, but lost and {{had turned into a}} beast. He tells them the only way she can be defeated is by neutralizing the power of her Rune, using Drigellum energy; which can only be found in the hearts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>people.</b> Each of the party's hearts generates Drigellum, which is forged into a sword. The party enter Mother's lair and fight her. Jaster again releases the power of the Star King. He reveals Mother as being a sorceress named Ilzarbella (Wendee Lee) who served the Star King until she was seduced by the power of Rune. Using the Drigellum sword, the Star King/Jaster kills her. However, as soon as the battle ends, the Emperor arrives with the intention of collecting the Rune energy to create beasts so as to continue the war. However, Rune takes over the ship, killing Valkog and Norma, and integrating them into an organic vessel which it uses to attack Jaster and his group. The group split up, with each member attacking a separate part of the ship, eventually defeating it.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} invoked {{responses from}} some {{cast and crew}} members from the series. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the BBC was glad that the episode provoked debate, and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story. That said Neame was also surprised {{by some of the}} responses, rationalising that those responders did not understand the context, and that it was not intended to offend anybody. Stephen Garrett, the director of Kudos Film and Television, the producer of Spooks agreed, further stating that the episode [...] "deals with very real stuff that's happening in the world. It touches nerves on a regular basis, and deals with uncomfortable truths." [...] Brenton meanwhile stated that [...] "people are free to make what they want of drama," [...] and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture, religion, world or profession. Oyelowo had said that the episode did not say that all Muslims are terrorists, only that some fanatics can give [...] "millions <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> a bad name." [...] The actor also believed that the Muslims who were [...] "up in arms" [...] about the story did not see the episode, but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the period}} of the Second Temple, there {{developed}} a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, in Apocalypse of Baruch, and 2 Esdras. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the Dead Sea scrolls texts. Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> will be reincarnated and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” Paul, who also was a Pharisee, said that at the resurrection what is [...] "sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body." [...] Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.|$|E

2500|$|Whitney was not {{the only}} {{character}} whose fate was met with demise. [...] "Suspect" [...] became the show's first [...] "cracking the mystery" [...] episode, which revolved with the attempted murder of Lionel Luthor by a mysterious assailant; it was influenced by the Japanese film Rashomon, just like season one's episode [...] "Zero", which is told from different people’s perspective of the same event. It was originally decided that Lionel's assistant, Dominic Santori, {{was going to be the}} person who attempted to kill Lionel, but ultimately it was decided that Sheriff Ethan would be villain of the episode. Although Jonathan Kent was also a suspect, it was clear to at least Greg Beeman that they could not pin the crime on a series regular, so they decided to try to surprise the audience by making it Ethan. Mitchell Kosterman, who plays Sheriff Ethan, was a little distraught over his character’s fate, having grown comfortable with his place on the show. The original ending of the episode featured Ethan taking a nurse hostage, which Kosterman felt was out of character; subsequently, the final version had Ethan giving up the second it is revealed that he was caught. To Kosterman, this ending allows the character to stay sympathetic, by showing that he was [...] "pushed to a bad place", because Kosterman feels, [...] "that whole dynamic <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> being pushed to do the wrong thing by bad people like Lionel Luthor is a pervading theme in the whole show".|$|E
