5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is {{the introduction of the}} go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel {{than on the}} musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> {{might have been}} made in the 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

25|$|Both the Homeric epics and the Epic Cycle take origin from oral tradition. Even {{after the}} {{composition}} of the Iliad, Odyssey, and the Cyclic Epics, the myths of the Trojan War were passed on orally, in many genres of poetry and through non-poetic storytelling. Events and details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> are only found in later authors may have been passed on through oral tradition and could be as old as the Homeric poems. Visual art, such as vase-painting, was another medium in which myths of the Trojan War circulated.|$|E

25|$|The arts of Southeast Asia have {{affinity}} with {{the arts of}} other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands {{as well as the}} feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.|$|E
25|$|But it is {{impossible}} that Secret Mark is dependent upon John 11. In its version of the story, there are no traces of the rather extensive Johannine redaction (proper names, motif of the delay of Jesus' travel, measurement of space and time, discourses of Jesus with his disciples and with Martha and Mary). As to its form, Secret Mark represents a stage of development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> corresponds to the source used by John. The author evidently still {{had access to the}} free tradition of stories about Jesus, or perhaps to some older written collection of miracle stories.|$|E

500|$|The Cullen {{house was}} one of the major [...] "match" [...] assignments, mainly because of the Portland area location's unique design. The {{production}} team agreed upon finding a house in the Vancouver area with an interior that emulated the high ceilings, glass walls, and forest surroundings of the first location. One location was positively compared to the one in Portland, and therefore Weitz and the production team filmed portions of the film there.

[...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, the part where Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with a stick, and the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at night when she sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E

[...] Soderbergh said that Orantes [...] "gets dropped into situations and has to deal with cultural as well as scientific issues that are sometimes at odds", and notes that she has a [...] "professional" [...] yet stubborn, [...] "remote", and [...] "dispassionate" [...] demeanor, though [...] "something happens to her in the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> causes a significant emotional shift." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} Chakotay, {{the producers}} sought {{the assistance of}} Jamake Highwater, a writer of more than 25 books of both fiction and nonfiction related to Native American myths and traditions. Highwater was a controversial choice of advisor, having been exposed by Hank Adams and Vine Deloria, Jr. as taking a fake Native American ancestry to sell books. Around September 21, 1993, Highwater gave seven pages of notes to producers regarding Chakotay's backstory, but his tribal ancestry was unresolved. By {{the end of that}} month, Michael Piller drafted the first version of the writer's bible for the series in which the character was named [...] "Chakotoy". By the time Piller wrote the first draft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> eventually became the Voyager pilot [...] "", the character was known as [...] "Chakotay" [...] and been made a Sioux.
