40|$|Over {{recent years}} the number of {{enquiries}} has increased as to whether <b>organisms</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> certain techniques are captured by the EU’s GMO legislation. In this advice, ACRE considers techniques that were identified by an EU Commission working group as posing particular challenges (these {{are listed in the}} first column of Table 1). ACRE has discussed these techniques in the context of plant breeding although many of them (or equivalents) are used in the modification of other organisms such as animals and microorganisms. We have come to our conclusions about the status of these techniques and the organisms that they generate by determining whether the scientific terms in the definition apply in each case. However, as the legal significance of many of these terms is not clear, Ministers will need to seek a legal opinion on our conclusions. Our considerations have highlighted three main issues where legal clarification is required. These issues are as follows. A. Are the offspring of GMOs necessarily GMOs?

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} ongoing jurisprudential dispute over whether commodification {{of the human}} body, {{including}} gendered commodification as <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> conflicts with a desirable exercise of self-ownership rights. Contrary to the prevailing view, it argues that the commodification {{of the human body}} caused <b>by</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> including reproductive technologies, does not necessarily undermine the discourse of emancipatory Lockean self-ownership, or feminist and critical revisions of the Lockean paradigm. Commodification of the body <b>by</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> precisely because this technology is universal and indiscriminate, may extend self-ownership to subjugated groups historically denied it. The commodification so feared in emerging biotechnology finds precedent in earlier anti-slavery and emancipatory conceptions of self-ownership, thus undermining many of the central objections to commodification. The Article concludes that there is a real peril that market forces and discrimination may nonetheless disproportionately impact members of subjugated groups and jeopardize the benefits of this newly robust self-ownership...|$|R

25|$|In the 1970 and 1980s, {{scientists}} {{passed this}} hurdle by inventing procedures for combining the DNA of two vastly different species with genetic engineering.

Transgenesis will therefore change the germ cells, not only the somatic cells, in order to ensure that the transgenes are passed down to the offspring when the organisms reproduce.
