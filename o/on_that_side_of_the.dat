5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on {{one side or the}} other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} to the hillfort lies {{on the eastern side}} of the site, with a complex of earthwork fortifications.

25|$|By {{spring of}} 1943, {{the war was}} {{shifting}} to the Allies advantage. On 10 April 1943 a new base was established across the Owen Stanley Mountains at Dobodura, New Guinea. In April 1943, the 8th moved alone to Dobodura and achieved {{the distinction of being}} the first bombardment unit on the Northern side of the Owen-Stanley range—in fact, the 8th Squadron and the 49th Fighter Group were the only tactical outfits <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Range.|$|E
25|$|Upstairs {{from the}} main floor, the garret is used for bedrooms. Its {{ceilings}} were built {{at the height of}} the rafter collars. A slight break in the height of the floorboards corresponds with the masonry seam on the west wall, showing where the original house was added to. There is also evidence of the earlier smoke hood for the larger downstairs fireplace, and the north bedroom shows evidence of the stairway that once existed <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|E

Just past the junction is Lake Gleneida, part of the New York City water supply system, the center of a park <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route. A quarter-mile further on, at Reed Memorial Library, NY52 ends at a three-way junction with US6.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, leg theory {{involves}} concentrating {{the bowling}} attack {{at or near}} the line of leg stump. This {{may or may not be}} accompanied by a concentration of fielders on the leg side. The line of attack aims to cramp the batsman, making him play the ball with the bat close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the off side. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{portions}} of the range are over 60 million years old, with volcanics and a forearc basin as the primary mountain building processes responsible for the range. It {{is part of the}} larger grouping known as the Pacific Coast Ranges that extends over much of the western edge of North America from California to Alaska. The range creates a rain shadow effect for the Willamette Valley that lies to the east of the mountains, creating a more stable climate and significantly less rain than the coastal region of the state. To the west where the range over-shadows the Oregon Coast, the range causes more precipitation to fall <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, contributing to the numerous rivers that flow to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

50|$|The Mahadevi goddess {{has many}} aspects to her personality. She focuses <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her <b>that</b> suits her objectives, but unlike male Hindu deities, her powers and {{knowledge}} work in concert in a multifunctional manner, rather than sequential re-incarnation as with Vishnu. The ten aspects of her, also called Mahavidyas (or great forms of her knowledge) are: Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhairavi, Bhuvanesvari, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala.|$|R
25|$|Baring {{bought a}} house across New College Lane from the College to serve as fellows' lodgings (at some point this house was named Clarendon House), {{which was the first}} move of the College onto the {{northern}} side of New College Lane. This was soon followed by the purchase of other houses <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, which were collectively known as Ædes, and the old Chapel of Our Lady at Smithgate (which is now the Octagon, housing the Middle Common Room). Also during this period, a gatehouse was built on the Catte Street frontage and the old doors were reinstalled there. A new dining hall was built above the gatehouse, and much of the northern side of the Old Quadrangle, apart from Old Hall, was rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Young and Kelley {{arrived at}} the Hudson's Bay Company post Fort Vancouver on October 17, 1834, center of the Columbia District. The HBC was the preeminent {{economic}} force in the region's fur trade. At the time the Oregon Country was jointly occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America. Young decided to settle permanently {{on the west bank}} of the Willamette River, near the mouth of Chehalem Creek, opposite Champoeg. His home is believed to be the first house built by European Americans <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. Dr. John McLoughlin of the HBC tried to discourage American settlers in the region. The Mexican government of Alta California accused Young and his group of having stolen 200 horses when they left. The group denied this, saying some uninvited traveling companions had stolen the horses. McLoughlin blacklisted Young from doing business with the HBC.|$|E
25|$|The Bideford District Association of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as it {{was then}} known) {{introduced}} a lifeboat service in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore. In 1831 the work {{was taken over by}} the Devon Humane Society and they built a new boat house at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. This was large enough for two boats and a second one arrived in December that year but in 1848 was transferred to a second boat house at Braunton Burrows {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary. It was easier to launch from here to help ships <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water but crews for lifeboats at Braunton Burrows always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851. This was expanded to house a second boat in 1856 and the old boat house at Watertown eventually lost its boats.|$|E
50|$|The {{street was}} {{developed}} in the 1740s by John Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley of Stratton. When John Rocque mapped London in 1746, the development was in progress and so the streets <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Berkeley Square were shown only in outline. The area had previously been farmland, and Hill Street crosses Farm Street. Hill Street was named after a rise in the ground, with Hay Hill being another street nearby.|$|R

25|$|In January 1958, {{soon after}} the death of Shoghi Effendi in November, another {{intercontinental}} conference was held in Kampala and attended by his widow Ruhiyyih Khanum. Though sorrowful at his death, there was a call to service in honor of his service. The conference had been initially planned for less than 400 attendees and was overwhelmed as news of over 300 Persians alone were coming. Ultimately some 950 Bahá'ís, six Hands of the Cause, a member of the International Bahá'í Council, sixteen Auxiliary Board members, and representatives from eleven national spiritual assemblies (including those from the four African regional assemblies, those from the other national assemblies which had participated in campaign to bring the religion to sub-Saharan Africa - Britain, India, Iraq, Persia, and the United States - and those from Arabia and Japan), 450 African members, over 300 from Persia, two Knights of Bahá'u'lláh (one from the Pacific and one from the Arctic), and others from rest of the world were present at the formal convening of the conference as well as telegrams received from many other Hands of the Cause and 34 national assemblies arrived. Reportedly every hotel room was booked. Ruhiyyih Khanum anointed most attendees with Attar of rose before being admitted into a viewing of relics of Bahá'u'lláh as well as a reproduction of a painting of him {{on the first day of}} the conference. Viewings were also held of a large map by Shoghi Effendi showing the progress of the religion, films of Shrines and gardens from the Bahá'í World Center, as it existed then, as well as the Monument on the grave of Shoghi Effendi. Some $280,000 was raised at the conference from a segment of the attendees for donation to the progress of the religion. The foundation stone for the Mother Temple of Africa was laid and relics in silk bags made by Bahiyyih Khánum were set in place (planned to be under the wall <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple facing out across a grassy valley towards the Bahá'í Qiblih.) Ruhiyyih Khanum then spent a day among the Tseo people - speaking to school groups, receiving guests, and visiting homes. She donated money for the reconstruction of a center that had been lost.|$|E

500|$|In February 1890 Nansen {{addressed}} {{a meeting of}} the Norwegian Geographical Society in Oslo (then called Christiania). After drawing attention to the failures of the many expeditions which had approached the North Pole from the west, he considered the implications of the discovery of the Jeannette items, along with further finds of driftwood and other debris from Siberia or Alaska that had been identified along the Greenland coast. [...] "Putting all this together," [...] Nansen said, [...] "we are driven to the conclusion that a current flows ... from the Siberian Arctic Sea to the east coast of Greenland," [...] probably passing across the Pole. It seemed that the obvious thing to do was [...] "to make our way into the current <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pole where it flows northward, and by its help to penetrate into those regions which all who have hitherto worked against [...] have sought in vain to reach." ...|$|E
