25|$|Summoners are {{tasked with}} {{destroying}} Sin with a creature {{known as the}} Final Aeon, sacrificing themselves so that Spira can enjoy a peaceful period known as the Calm until Sin is reborn. Unbeknownst to most of Spira, the Final Aeon is always made from the fayth {{of one of the}} summoner's own guardians, and it is possessed by the spirit of Yu Yevon, Sin's creator, to be transformed into a new Sin after the previous Sin is destroyed. After the Final Aeon destroys the body or armor of the previous Sin, Yu Yevon possesses the Final Aeon and kills the summoner. The possessed Aeon's power is then used by Yu Yevon to create a new Sin, with Jecht being the current incarnation during Final Fantasy X. At the end of the game, the party must fight and destroy each aeon possessed by Yu Yevon in order to draw him out into the open so that he can be destroyed, and thus Yu Yevon does not possess an aeon, leaving him unable to create a new Sin. This final death of Sin marks the beginning of the Eternal Calm, as Spira is freed from its long cycle <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b>|$|E

25|$|In April 1916 about 1,250 armed Irish {{republicans}} under Padraig Pearse staged {{what became}} known as the Easter Rising in Dublin in pursuit not of Home Rule but of an Irish Republic. One of the rebels' first acts was to declare this Republic to be in existence. The rebels were composed of Irish Volunteers and the much smaller Irish Citizen Army under James Connolly. The rising saw rebel forces take over strongpoints in the city, including the Four Courts, Stephen's Green, Boland's mill, the South Dublin Union and Jacobs Biscuit Factory and establishing their headquarters at the General Post Office building in O'Connell street. They held for a week until they were forced to surrender to British troops. The British deployed artillery to bombard the rebels into submission, sailing a gunboat named the Helga up the Liffey and stationing field guns at Cabra, Phibsborough and Prussia street. Much of the city centre was destroyed by shell fire and around 450 people, about half of them civilians, were killed, with another 1,500 injured. Fierce combat took place along the grand canal at Mount street, where British troops were repeatedly ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the rebellion was marked by a wave of looting and lawlessness by Dublin's slum population and many of the city centre's shops were ransacked. The rebel commander, Patrick Pearse surrendered after a week, to avoid further civilian casualties. Initially, the rebellion was generally unpopular in Dublin, due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> it caused, the opinion by some that it was bad timing to irreverently hold it at Easter and also due to the fact that many Dubliners had relatives serving in the British Army.|$|E
500|$|Themes of {{life and}} death and the {{concepts}} of change and continuity {{play a major role in}} Kiarostami's works.

500|$|The {{sacrifice}} is then carried out through either physical or magical means, {{at which point}} the killer is believed to absorb power from the body and spirit of the victim, thus entering a new level of [...] "sinister" [...] consciousness. As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the acausal forces <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction,</b> such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings. Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing.|$|E

Darwin noted the horrors <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction,</b> and FitzRoy carefully established that mussel beds were now above high tide, giving clear evidence of the ground rising some [...] which he confirmed a month later.

500|$|To Spielberg, {{the black}} and white {{presentation}} of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: [...] "The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white." [...] Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety {{can be seen as a}} metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in Nazi Germany between making use of the Jews for slave labor or exterminating them outright. Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a Holocaust train loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.|$|E
500|$|Like Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, {{the story}} of The Flopsy Bunnies is about rabbits intruding upon the human domain and {{bringing}} the threat <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> upon themselves by their own imprudence. M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh indicates in Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that the tale's principal theme is the trickster animal, though she is careful to point out that, even then, the animals are subordinate to the exquisite garden backgrounds. The reader's interest in the tale, she believes, lies in following the joke played upon McGregor {{rather than in the}} dull personalities of the rabbits. Although the trickster qualities of the rabbits are evident but muted in the earlier Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, in Flopsy Bunnies these qualities are brought to center stage. Kutzer notes that The Flopsy Bunnies belongs not to the title characters but to their parents [...] it is they who save the baby bunnies [...] and thus the story is often of less interest to children.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, [...] "American Life" [...] {{was included}} on her Re-Invention World Tour. It opened the Military-Army segment and {{started with the}} sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing the song as war footage <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> flashed on screens behind her. At the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license. During the performance, Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. Toronto Suns Jane Stevenson praised the performance, but called the background images [...] "sober". The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.|$|E
500|$|Casey Brienza, Carlo Santos, Carl Kimlinger and Theron Martin at Anime News Network (ANN) {{reviewed}} {{the first episode}} {{as part of a}} [...] "fall 2008 anime preview guide". Brienza called the series [...] "thoroughly enthralling" [...] when at its best, and said that its imagery <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> would be intriguing to viewers interested in apocalypse-themed works. She found the opening and ending themes [...] "bright but boring", and noted that they were at odds with the story. Santos, too, disliked the ending theme, combined with Takumi being an otaku with an imaginary girlfriend, saying that despite being [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] it felt too overt and annoying: he felt that Takumi's growing paranoia, the music and the art direction of the graphically violent scenes worked well to set the tone, but that the [...] "fluff" [...] involving Takumi's imaginary girlfriend and his sister disrupted the mood. Kimlinger also noted the inconsistent tone, and called the female characters [...] "painfully artificial". He was not opposed to the combination of the themes of [...] "otaku alienation" [...] and horror, but called the series' horror mystery an uninteresting mix of Higurashi When They Cry and Japanese psychological horror films. Martin called the series a contender for [...] "weirdest" [...] anime of the season, and also compared the tone to that of Higurashi When They Cry. He liked the visuals and music, calling the latter [...] "eerie" [...] and effective.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after the}} end of the 1966 {{television}} series, sales of Batman continued to fall and the title was nearly canceled. Although the 1970s restored the Joker as an insane, lethal foe of Batman, it was during the 1980s that the Batman series started to turn around and the Joker came into his own as part of the [...] "dark age" [...] of comics: mature tales <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> The shift was derided for moving away from tamer superheroes (and villains), but comic audiences were no longer primarily children. Several months after Crisis on Infinite Earths launched the era by killing off Silver-Age icons such as the Flash and Supergirl and undoing decades of continuity, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (1986) re-imagined Batman as an older, retired hero and the Joker as a lipstick-wearing celebrity who cannot function without his foe. The late 1980s saw the Joker exert a significant impact on Batman and his supporting cast. In the 1988–89 story arc [...] "", the Joker murders Batman's sidekick (the second Robin, Jason Todd). Todd was unpopular with fans; rather than modify his character, DC opted to let them vote for his fate and a 72-vote plurality had the Joker beat Todd to death with a crowbar. This story altered the Batman universe: instead of killing anonymous bystanders, the Joker murdered a core character in the Batman fiction; this had a lasting effect on future stories. Written at the height of tensions between the United States and Iran, the story's conclusion had Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini appoint the Joker his country's ambassador to the United Nations (allowing him to temporarily escape justice).|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with {{different}} themes: French Baroque–Marie Antoinette Revival, Military–Army, Circus–Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with [...] "The Beast Within", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform [...] "Vogue". It {{was followed by the}} energetically performed [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then [...] "Frozen", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny, were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret.

During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens. A remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.|$|E

2500|$|That the Rising {{resulted}} in a great deal <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction,</b> as well as disrupting food supplies, {{also contributed to the}} antagonism toward the rebels.
