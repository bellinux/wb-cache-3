40|$|The {{effects of}} {{irrigation}} methods on several bedding plants without polyethylene pots using compacted polyester fiber medium hardened by heat fusion were investigated. The characteristics of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{with a tray}} collecting runoff water (combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation) were investigated at the same time. Irrigation usage (the amount of water supplied per pot / amount of irrigation water) {{with a combination of}} <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was improved compared to <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> alone. The growth of garden type Cyclamen grown under a combination of both <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown in either wick irrigation, ebb & flow <b>irrigation</b> or <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Notably, smaller growth was achiered in garden type cyclamen grown with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The growth of Vinca grown in a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> alone. The irrigation amount had no effect on the growth of Vinca regardless of irrigation method. The growth of Petunia was greater with increased amounts of irrigation water. However, the growth of Pansy grown under <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> was significantly greater than that grown in a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation. These results suggest that a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation method in bedding plant production without polyethylene pots is generally suitable since the plants grow without drought stress. However, it may be suggested that the amount of irrigation water should be as low as possible in the winter season or with sensitive species in order to prevent waterlogging injury. 熱融着性ポリエステル繊維固化培地を利用したポットレス花壇苗生産における灌水方法として，水受けトレイを用いた頭上灌水（頭上底面灌水）の実用性を検討した．頭上灌水と比較して頭上底面灌水では灌水効率（培地に吸収された灌水量／灌水量）が大幅に改善できた．ガーデンシクラメンの生育は頭上底面灌水区で最もよく，次いでひも灌水，底面灌水の順であり，頭上灌水区で最も生育が抑制された．ニチニチソウでは頭上灌水より頭上底面灌水区で生育が改善されたが，灌水量には差はほとんどみられなかった．ペチュニアでは灌水量が多いほど，専用トレイに溜める水量が多いほど生育が旺盛になった．しかし，パンジーでは頭上底面灌水によって生育が抑制された．ポットレス花壇苗生産では頭上底面灌水が最も適切であったが，蒸発散の少ない冬期や過湿に弱い種においては灌水量をできるだけ少なくすべきと考えられた...|$|R

40|$|Water quality {{remains a}} {{predominant}} issue within the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and nutrient loading continues {{to undermine the}} progressive recovery of this ecosystem. Until recently, the ornamental plant industry has had little information to develop better management practices {{to increase the efficiency}} of water and nutrient applications. This research used an integrated approach to examine container- production systems, to develop recommendations to increase nutrient uptake efficiency and reduce runoff. A 40 -month field study examined the effects of various cultural practices on irrigation and nutrient uptake efficiencies. Under cyclic scheduling, drip irrigation applied 3 to 4. 5 times less water than <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and had significantly less runoff when plants were spaced at low densities. While drip irrigation is significantly more efficient, <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> is more practical and economically feasible for most small container-nursery stock. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) was examined as an alternative to cyclic scheduling and when used with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> water applications were half that of cyclic irrigation scheduling.. This research simultaneously documented nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics by examining nutrient applications, uptake and leaching over the forty months. In most cases, N and P uptake efficiency and runoff was negatively affected by <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> particularly when soluble nutrients were applied via fertigation and at low plant densities. Nitrogen and P efficiencies ranged between 10 and 30 % and were dependent upon methods of irrigation and fertilization, plant density and water use. The use of both drip and TDR-scheduled <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> reduced nutrient runoff to half that of the <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> program Intensive spring nutrient uptake studies showed that N influences the total growth of Rhododendron (azalea) and P uptake is a function of P fertilization rate and growth, influenced by N rate. Moderate N rates maintained optimal growth, while total P was only required at 1 / 20 of this N rate. Periodicity in nutrient uptake suggests seasonal timing of fertilizers may increase N and P uptake efficiency.

To develop bedding plant production system without PP, properties of compacted medium hardened by heat fusion polyester fiber were investigated. Effects of irrigation methods {{on the growth}} of vegetative propagated petunia grown in medium without PP were investigated. The effect of medium type was not as significant as the difference in water loss per pot. Water loss per pot of medium without PP was about two times greater than medium held in PP. No compacted medium disintegrated easily without root-ball formation, and in 20 days after cutting about half of non-compacted medium had disintegrated. Compacted medium did not disintegrate before rooting. Medium type did not significantly affect rooting rates, plant heights, leaf numbers and fresh weights when transplanted to medium. Also, cell or pot medium type did not significantly affect plant heights, flower numbers, leaf numbers and fresh weights. Non-compacted medium without PP easily disintegrated with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Subirrigation and much <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> had similar effect on growth when planted in containers.

These effects may help treated plants {{to survive a}} transplant shock. Under mild water stress, ProCa caused a transient reduction in leaf stomatal conductance (gs) in 'Camarosa' and 'Sweet Charlie' plants. This reduction in gs was paralleled by a decrease in transpiration in treated plants, which was not attributable to differences in plant size or leaf area. Pressure volume curves of 'Sweet Charlie' plants revealed that ProCa application lowered leaf osmotic potential at both full and zero turgor, and increased the volumetric modulus of elasticity. ProCa treatment regulated the leaf morphology of strawberry and preconditioned strawberry plants to tolerate water stress.

40|$|Growth {{control of}} container-grown hardy nursery stock {{generally}} requires substantial labour investment.

Increasing water costs and limited availability of abstraction licences have added further incentives for nursery stock producers to use deficit irrigation. There are still, however, concerns that inherent nonuniformity of water uptake under commonly used <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and differing irrigation requirements of diverse crops and substrates, may limit the commercial relevance of a protocol developed for single crops growing in 100 % peat and irrigated with a high precision drip system. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine whether growth control of hardy nursery stock is possible using deficit irrigation applied with conventional <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Over two years, crop growth under an <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> system was compared under full irrigation and two severities of deficit irrigation.

Deficit irrigation was found to be highly effective in controlling vegetative growth when applied using <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> - with similar results as when drip irrigation was used. This comparable response suggests that deficit irrigation can be applied without precision drip irrigation. Scheduling two very different crops with respect to their water use and uptake potential, however, highlighted challenges with respect to application of appropriate deficits for very different crops under one system; responses to deficit irrigation will be more consistent where nursery management allows for scheduling of crops with very different architecture and water use under different regimes. The effectiveness of deficit irrigation in controlling the growth of Forsythia was similar when a reduced peat based substrate was compared with pure peat; additionally, flowering was enhanced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to discuss {{certain aspects of}} irrigation {{on the basis of}} limited information which has been gained at Tongaat during the past few years. The ideas put forward mayor may not be agreed with, but if they stimulate interest and discussion on the numerous problems and unknowns, which arise from the application of water to sugar cane, then this paper has served its purpose. The word irrigation has come to mean the controlled application of water to the land, that is, specific quantities of water at planned times, and any application of water which falls short of these objectives requires another word to describe it. There are two methods 'of irrigation-surface or furrow <b>irrigation</b> and <b>overhead,</b> spray or sprinkler irrigation. It is important to realise that either can be the right way to irrigate. Where the land is gently sloping and water abundant and cheap, furrow irrigation must be considered first and foremost. When the terrain is difficult and, in particuJlar, water scarce or expensive, then <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> comes into its own. It is for precisely these reasons that <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> has been developed at Tongaat. Although the following conclusions relate to <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the principles involved apply equally well to furrow irrigation governed only by the practical difficulties of applying precise quantities of water at each application. Response to Irrigation Up to the present time only a few experiments have been carried out to study the response to the <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> of sugar cane in Natal. It is interesting to examine the results which are available if,. at the same time, the limited confidence which can be placed on them is also borne in mind.

Three <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> (DI 30 - irrigation with 30 % of ETc; DI 50 - irrigation with 50 % ETc, FI - full irrigation – 100 % Etc) were compared to a control non-irrigated treatment (NI). Compared to NI, the deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> (DI 30 & DI 50) showed no significant differences on the yield and its components. The full <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatment</b> induced a significantly higher yield due to a higher bunch weight, {{as compared with the}} others treatments.

Analysis across the soil textures showed that fresh yields {{were not significant}} between the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> However, the same analysis across the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> revealed {{that the effect of}} soil texture was significant on the fresh yield and loamy sand produced significantly higher fresh yield than the other two soils, probably because of higher leaf area index, higher photosynthesis rates, and "stay-green" effect late in the growing season. More analysis showed that there was a significant interaction between the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> and soil textures that the highest fresh yield was obtained under FI in loamy sand. Furthermore, analysis across the soil textures showed that water productivities, WP (kgÂ ha- 1 fresh tuber yieldÂ mm- 1 ET) were not significantly different between the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> However, across the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments,</b> the soil textures were significantly different. This showed that the interaction between <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> and soil textures was significant that the highest significant WP was obtained under DI in sandy loam. While PRD and DI treatments increased WP by, respectively, 11 and 5 % in coarse sand and 28 and 36 % in sandy loam relative to FI, they decreased WP in loamy sand by 15 and 13 %. The reduced WP in loamy sand was due to nearly 28 % fresh tuber yield loss in PRD and DI relative to FI even though ET was reduced by 9 and 11 % in these <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> This study showed that different soils will affect water-saving irrigation strategies that are worth knowing for suitable agricultural water management. So, under non-limited water resources conditions, loamy sand produces the highest yield under full irrigation but water-saving irrigations (PRD and DI) are not recommended due to considerable loss (28 %) in yield. However, under restricted water resources, it is recommended to apply water-saving irrigations in sandy loam and coarse sand to achieve the highest water productivity.

40|$|Under {{regulated}} deficit irrigation {{at different}} stages, the changes of endogenous hormones (ABA and ZR) in developing grain were studied to identify how hormonal levels regulated {{the effect of}} water deficit on grain filling in winter wheat. Six <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> (A, B, C, D, E, F) with water deficit imposed at different development stages were set up. When water deficit was imposed at both vegetative and reproductive stages (booting or flowering) (A, B, C treatments), grain-filling rate obviously decreased and grain-filling period was shortened. On the other hand, ABA content in developing grain was obviously higher and increased faster, whereas, ZR content and the ratio of ZR to ABA in grain were much lower and increased more slowly, compared with those under the treatments (D, E, F) of no water deficit imposed at reproductive stage. With all <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments,</b> ZR in grain reached the peak at 7 days after flowering, then declined. Among those <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> without water deficit imposed at reproductive stage, {{there was no significant}} difference in grain yield and the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatment</b> D with water deficit conducted at both regreening and jumping stages could be suggested as a most saving and high yield irrigation way in winter wheat...|$|R

To understand the effects of conventional deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying treatments on yield, yield components and water use efficiency of sunflower (Farrokh cultivar), one study was carried out. The research was conducted on Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman in the spring of 2011. A factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design with one control (full irrigation) and 18 deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> in three replications was considered. Deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> were: conventional deficit irrigation (irrigation with % 80, % 60 and % 40 ETP) and partial root zone drying (irrigation with % 80, % 60 and % 40 ETP). Every deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatment</b> was conducted in three growth stage of sunflower (all periods of growth, vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage). The results showed that the conventional deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> (<b>irrigation</b> with 80 % ETP) in vegetative growth had the highest plant height, leaf area, leaf area index and head diameter. Also, the maximum biological yield equal to 49054, maximum grain yield is equal to 9934 / 3 and maximum oil yield is equal to 2441 / 2 kg per hectare in the conventional deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> (<b>irrigation</b> with 80 % ETP) in vegetative growth occurred. The highest water use efficiency for grain yield is equal to 1 / 46,forbiological yield equal to 7 / 21 and for dry forage yield is equal 5 / 7 kilograms per cubic meter of water. According to results,conventional deficit irrigation (irrigation with % 80, % 60 and % 40 ETP) is recommended on based...|$|R

40|$|In {{a related}} study, it was {{established}} {{that the use of}} an ebb-and-flood irrigation method during forcing of the taproots of witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L) could be used to increase lateral root formation. In this study, five <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments</b> were used and lateral root formation as well as chicon yield and quality were monitored. Leaf yield was not significantly affected by the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Standard EU grades were used to develop a parametric chicon quality index (Ql). Taking into account that all conditions except for the <b>irrigation</b> <b>treatments,</b> were controlled and identical for all experimental units, a tendency of an inverse relationship between lateral root formation and chicon quality was found. An aeroponic irrigation system significantly increased lateral root development but produced the lowest QI. Since potential income is dependent on both chicon quality and leaf yield, these parameters were combined and showed that the best potential income was obtained with the ebb-and-flood irrigation method, a promising alternative to be further investigated.
