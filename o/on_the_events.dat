40|$|It {{is argued}} that free QFT can be defined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime and that that theory is unitarily and algebraically {{equivalent}} to QFT in the bulk (near the horizon). Under that unitary equivalence the bulk hidden SL(2,R) symmetry found in a previous work becomes manifest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon, it being induced {{by a group of}} horizon diffeomorphisms. The class of generators of that group can be enlarged to include a full Virasoro algebra of fields defined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon. These generators have a quantum representation in QFT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon and thus in the bulk...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{generalization}} of the recent work [arXiv: 1206. 1420] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> modified Hawking temperature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon. Here <b>the</b> Hawking temperature is generalized by multiplying the modified Hawking temperature by a variable parameter α representing {{the ratio of the}} growth rate of the apparent horizon to <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon. It is found that both the first and the generalized second law of thermodynamics are valid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon for any fluid distribution. Subsequently, Bekenstein entropy is modified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> horizon and thermodynamical laws are examined. Finally, interpretation of the parameters involved has been presented.

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E
