5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

The {{guidance}} in this Chapter {{applies to all}} inland <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> that have been drained, i. e., drainage of lands that started {{in the past and}} that still persists, or newly drained lands within the reporting period. This means that the water table level is at least temporarily below natural levels. Natural levels mean that the mean annual water table is near the soil surface but can experience seasonal fluctuations. Within each land-use category water table level is manipulated to varying degrees depending on land-use purpose, e. g., for cultivating cereals, rice, or for aquaculture, which can be reflected by different drainage classes. This Chapter deals with inland <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> which do not meet the definition of “coastal” defined in Chapter 4 of this Wetlands Supplement.

40|$|Emission {{scenarios}} {{based on}} integrated quantitative modelling are {{a valuable tool}} in planning strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation. By estimating the potential of individual mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, resources can be targeted to the most promising policy measures. This paper reports two agricultural emission scenarios for Finland up to year 2020, one baseline scenario (Scenario 1) based on the projected agricultural production levels determined by markets and agricultural policy and one with selected mitigation measures included (Scenario 2). Measures selected for the analysis consisted of 1) keeping agricultural area at the current level, 2) decreasing the proportion of <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> 3) increasing the proportion of grass cultivation on <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> and 4) supporting biogas production on farms. Starting from 2005, the emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture would decrease 2. 3 % in Scenario 1 by 2020 whereas the respective decrease would be 11. 5 % in Scenario 2. According to the results, mitigation measures targeted to cultivation of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> have the largest potential to reduce the emissions.

50|$|In {{both the}} FAO soil {{classification}} and the USDA soil taxonomy, a histosol is a soil consisting primarily of organic materials. They {{are defined as}} having 40 cm or more of <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> material in the upper 80 cm. <b>Organic</b> <b>soil</b> material has an organic carbon content (by weight) of 12 to 18 percent, or more, depending on the clay content of the soil. These materials include muck (sapric soil material), mucky peat (hemic soil material), or peat (fibric soil material). Aquic conditions or artificial drainage are required. Typically, histosols have very low bulk density and are poorly drained because the organic matter holds water very well. Most are acidic and many are very deficient in major plant nutrients which are washed away in the consistently moist soil.|$|E

Organic matter in soil undergoes change as it breaks down and decomposes and new material is added. Careful management of this soil is necessary to prevent wind erosion.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the climate {{conferences}} in Durban (2011) and Doha (2012), voluntary accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> is now possible in national climate reporting. The quality of the data describing the spatial extent of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> and their relevant soil properties thus becomes particularly important. For climate reporting issues, maps for <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> at different scales and levels of detail are used. In Germany, for example, the soil map at scale 1 : 1, 000, 000 is the basis for the emission inventory (NIR 2013). In contrast, the national inventory report of The Netherlands is based on a soil map at scale 1 : 50, 000 (Coenen et al. 2013). This leads to questions about the optimal level of detail or scale for climate reporting.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> including peatlands, in the global carbon cycle, detailed information on regional and global emissions is scarce.

Results indicated that over 25 million hectares of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> were drained worldwide for agriculture use, of which about 60 % were in boreal and temperate cool areas, 34 % in tropical areas, and 5 % in warm temperate areas.

Of this, the CO 2 component, about 780 million tonnes, represented more than one-fourth of total net CO 2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and land use. The bulk of these emissions came from a few tropical countries in Southeast Asia, and was linked to land clearing and drainage for crop cultivation.
