25|$|A golden capsule or foil <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Denotes a wine {{considered}} {{better by}} the producer. Usually means a Prädikatswein that is sweeter or more intense, or indicates an auction wine {{made in a}} very small lot.|$|E
500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} day, Kirsty had {{difficulty}} with their brand's label, {{as the name}} [...] couldn't be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> during their advert, meaning she had to squeeze the bottle {{for it to be}} visible in the closing shot. Meanwhile, {{the rest of the team}} failed to have the label's design with them for the artists doing their presentation site's graffiti wall, meaning they had to leave a basic design for them on note sheet as a result.|$|E

2500|$|Scotch whiskies are {{generally}} distilled twice, although some are distilled {{a third time}} and others even up to twenty times. [...] Scotch Whisky Regulations require anything bearing the label [...] "Scotch" [...] to be distilled in Scotland and matured {{for a minimum of}} three years in oak casks, among other, more specific criteria. Any age statement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> {{in the form of a}} number, must reflect the age of the youngest Scotch whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old.|$|E
2500|$|The Boston Beer Company, {{maker of}} Samuel Adams, {{was among the}} first {{contemporary}} brewers to start adding freshness dates to their product line in 1985. [...] For ten years there was a slow growth in [...] brewers adding freshness dates to their beer. [...] The practice rapidly grew in popularity after the Anheuser-Busch company's heavily marketed [...] "Born-On dates" [...] starting in 1996. [...] Many other brewers have started adding freshness dates to their products, but there is no standard for what the date means. [...] For some companies, the date <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> or can will be the date that the beer was bottled; others have the date by which the beer should be consumed.|$|E
2500|$|Chapman Root {{approved}} the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> in November 1915. The prototype {{never made it}} to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on conveyor belts. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the Patent Gazette on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the [...] "Christmas bottle." [...] Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle {{is one of the most}} recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".|$|E

50|$|Fremlin's was a brewery in Maidstone, Kent, England. It was {{established}} by Ralph Fremlin in 1861, who eschewed the pub trade and focused on bottled beer, <b>on</b> religious grounds. <b>The</b> beer was known for the distinctive elephant logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles.</b> <b>The</b> brewery expanded to become the largest in Kent, before going into decline after being purchased by Whitbread in 1967.|$|R

2500|$|The tapes {{revealed}} several crucial {{conversations that}} took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized {{many aspects of the}} Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a “cancer on the presidency.” The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: “That’s the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [...] is involved in that; John [...] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that’s an obstruction of justice.” Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: “...just looking at the immediate problem, don’t you have to have—handle Hunt’s financial situation damn soon?… you’ve got to keep the cap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> that much, in order to have any options.” ...|$|E

Back then we would go do dinners and sit with Loud Records president Steve Rifkind and them up at the label. And our mission would be like, when we sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some Mo or something and they didn't have it. So we was like [...] "What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?" [...] And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Examination of the tequila bottle {{found near}} the body found {{a mix of}} Nelson's blood and adipose tissue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Forensic {{scientist}} Marie Campbell stated that this was normally {{the result of a}} wounding injury causing bleeding and body fat to become mixed, and that similar results were observed on knives examined after stabbings. In this instance, the stains on the tequila bottle [...] "did not have the distinctive pattern she would have expected" [...] if the bottle had been used directly as a weapon. When found, the body had a plastic bag partly melted over much of the face, bruising inside the lip, two black eyes and bleeding inside her skull. Pathologists said [...] "some form of throttling or suffocating was the most probable cause of death" [...] and she may have been suffocated with the plastic bag or there might have been pressure applied to the neck. Bell said: [...] "There were findings at post-mortem consistent with assault, with such a manner of death in keeping with the circumstances in which her body was found. As to the actual mechanism of her death, perhaps the most likely cause has been some form of asphyxia. I cannot exclude the possibility that sharp force injury has been the cause of her death, or blunt force trauma." [...] The cause of death was officially recorded as unascertained.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine {{collector}} Hardy Rodenstock. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr. and Michael Broadbent {{who at the time}} was a director at the London auction house Christie's and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of Château d'Yquem, including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare [...] "Jefferson bottles", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the American president, Thomas Jefferson. American businessman Bill Koch bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.|$|E
