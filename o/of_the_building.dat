40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> along {{a heritage}} street known as Tan Hiok Nee Street in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

The finding suggests that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> do not meet <b>the</b> current demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> users. Some strategies need to be devised in order to retain the heritage street for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future generations...|$|R
