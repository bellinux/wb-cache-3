500|$|Mandela {{expressed}} {{the view that}} [...] "South Africa's future foreign relations [...] be based on <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> human rights should be the core of international relations". Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the [...] "narrow, chauvinistic interests" [...] of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, {{for which he was}} criticised by both Israel and India. Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.|$|E
500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter {{than the rest of}} the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be no mistake about <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".|$|E

40|$|Keith DeRose’s {{solution}} to the skeptical problem is based on his indirect sensitivity account. Sensitivity is not {{a necessary condition for}} any kind of knowledge, as direct sensitivity accounts claim, but the insensitivity of <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false explains why we tend to judge that we do not know them. The orthodox objection line against any kind of sensitivity account of knowledge is to present instances of insensitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> we still judge to constitute knowledge. This objection line offers counter-examples against the claim of direct sensitivity accounts that sensitivity is necessary for any kind of knowledge. These examples raise an easy problem for indirect sensitivity accounts that claim that there is only a tendency to judge <b>that</b> insensitive <b>beliefs</b> do not constitute knowledge, which still applies to <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false. However, a careful analysis reveals <b>that</b> some of <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are sensitive; nevertheless, we still judge that we do not know them. Therefore, the fact <b>that</b> some of <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are insensitive cannot explain why we tend to judge that we do not know them. Hence, indirect sensitivity accounts cannot fulfill their purpose of explaining our intuitions about skepticism. This is the hard problem for indirect sensitivity account...|$|R

The results of the tests refine an explicit, Bayesian model of <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> certain keys are compromised. In choosing tests based on this criteria, we significantly reduce the number of tests, as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, required to identify compromised keys.

2500|$|Maria Feodorovna {{was pretty}} and popular. [...] Early on {{she made it}} a {{priority}} to learn the Russian language {{and to try to}} understand the Russian people. She rarely interfered with politics, preferring to devote her time and energies to her family, charities and the more social side of her position. Her one exception was her militant anti-German sentiment due to the annexation of Danish territories by Prussia in 1864, a sentiment echoed by her sister, Alexandra. Prince Gorchakov remarked about this policy: “it is <b>our</b> <b>belief,</b> <b>that</b> Germany will not forget that both in Russia and in England a Danish Princess has her foot {{on the steps of the}} throne.” [...] Maria Feodorovna suffered a miscarriage in 1866 in Denmark while horseriding.|$|E

Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as [...] "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined".

40|$|This article {{draws on}} the {{writings}} of Slavoj Žižek to argue that legal architecture {{is a source of}} ideological <b>beliefs.</b> Žižek asserts <b>that</b> it is through the materialisation of ideology that people often first encounter ideological beliefs, and through exposure to these materialisations ideological beliefs are formed over time. Instead of our acts reflecting <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> it is <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> are born out of <b>our</b> acts and <b>belief</b> is merely the formal act of recognising what we already believe. Due to its scale and silence legal architecture is a particularly prominent though largely unnoticed site for the materialisation of legal ideology. The article explores the ideological dimensions of two popular styles of legal architecture – neoclassicism and postmodernism. It argues that neoclassical legal architecture can materialise belief in the eternality, universality, and unchallengeable authority of historic and hierarchical legal relations and norms, and theorises that postmodernist legal architecture likely materialises an equally problematic cynical indifference towards social stratification while projecting an intimate relationship between multinational corporations and the practice of law...|$|R

2500|$|The {{issue that}} vexed Kant {{was central to}} what 20th-century {{scholars}} called [...] "the philosophy of mind". The flowering {{of the natural sciences}} had led to an understanding of how data reaches the brain. Sunlight falling on an object is reflected from its surface in a way that maps the surface features (color, texture, etc.). The reflected light reaches the human eye, passes through the cornea, is focused by the lens onto the retina where it forms an image similar to that formed by light passing through a pinhole into a camera obscura. The retinal cells send impulses through the optic nerve and then they form a mapping in the brain of the visual features of the object. The interior mapping is not the exterior object, and <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> there is a meaningful relationship between the object and the mapping in the brain depends on a chain of reasoning that is not fully grounded.
