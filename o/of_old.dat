30|$|Rejuvenation {{through the}} outflow <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers {{is a less}} {{pronounced}} staffing pattern. Overall, only 42 percent of all establishments rejuvenate because their shares <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers among all separations exceed the share <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers in the total workforce. Moreover, {{the differences between the}} share <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers among hires and among the total workforce are mostly marginal. The most striking exception are dominant-downsizing firms, in which the share <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers among separations exceeds the share <b>of</b> <b>older</b> employees in the total workforce by more than six percentage points.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} a literature review on older persons globally. In recent years the number <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons aged 60 years and older is growing worldwide. Declining in birth and mortality rates are said to be the main contributors to this new phenomenon. Life expectancy of general population has also increased, and thus the number <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population in society increased. Although all nations in the world are experiencing the growth <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population, developed countries has a relatively large portion of this population in their population structure. The {{purpose of this article is}} analyzing the process of demographic transistion that produces the growth <b>of</b> <b>older</b> person world wide. In particular, it describes the growth <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population globally with particular emphasis on the proportion <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population over the years, distribution <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population, and rate of growth <b>of</b> this <b>older</b> population. By using a secondary analysis, various sources related to older persons at international level are reviewed. This paper highlights that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population has increased, it has distributed unevently, and the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>older</b> population is higher as compared to the growth of the total population globally...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{employment}} <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons {{in the labor market}} in the Czech Republic. The aging of the population is currently becoming a major demographic feature in most developed countries, including the Czech Republic, which is causing social and economic problems. Employment <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons is becoming more important. The aim of the study is to evaluate the development of the employment <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people in the Czech Republic in the years 2000 - 2012 and to propose measures that would contribute to its increase. In the theoretical part of the thesis are discussed factors that affect the employment <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons. These include demographic changes, age discrimination, setting of the retirement system or measures of the European Union. Practical part of thesis is primarily engaged in employment <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons in the Czech Republic and there are presented advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers and the proposals of individual actions that could contribute to increase the employment rate <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} three types of living arrangements, namely living alone, living with family, {{and living in a}} hostel, and the psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people in Hong Kong. The impact of various sociodemographic factors on the choice of living arrangements <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people was also studied. Methods: Ninety healthy Hong Kong Chinese were recruited from four multi-service centres and one hostel. An individual interview was conducted with each participant and the General Health Questionnaire- 12 and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale- 10 were administered. Results: The results suggested that the psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people living in hostels was better than that <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people living alone, but that the psychological well-being <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people living with their family was not different from that <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people living alone. Conclusion: That the psychological well-being <b>of</b> <b>older</b> people in different living arrangements is different may be explained by the differences in time for leisure, access to social services, as well as changes in their attitude towards co-residence with children...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is two-fold. The first is to relate the {{negative}} image <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers to stereotype threat and to propose that effective retention management should start by replacing this negative image. The second is to assess the needs, perceptions and preferences <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers regarding their career-ending. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 266 employer questionnaires and 1, 290 older worker questionnaires identified the employers' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers and the career-ending needs and preferences <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers. Findings - The results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the negative image <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers forms a self-fulfilling prophecy due to the mechanisms of stereotype threat. Furthermore, the results indicate that job involvement plays a crucial role in the preference for retirement or to keep on working. Research limitations/implications - Stereotype threat promises to be very important when it comes to career-ending measures for older workers. However, the empirical design of the study limits the possibility of drawing direct inferences about the effects of stereotype threat on older workers. Practical implications - Measures and policies aimed at prolonging the participation <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers at the labor market should be tailored to the specific needs, perceptions and preferences <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers. Originality/value - The concept of stereotype threat has never been connected with the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers. Further, the assessment of the needs, perceptions and preferences related to the career-ending <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers has never before been examined in a European study...|$|R

However, higher participation rates <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers in IT training are related to a larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>older</b> workers within firms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a perspective on}} the development of knowledge in the spiritual dimension of aging, with particular emphasis on wellbeing. At present, the gerontological literature is drawing attention to the increasing influential role of spirituality in physical and psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>older</b> adults. Spirituality has a significant positive relationship with physical and psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> the <b>older</b> adults. Further, spiritual intervention helps the individuals to recover from psychological distress and death anxiety, as well as from chronic illness. With the rapid growth <b>of</b> <b>older</b> populations worldwide, emerging issues regarding the physical and mental health <b>of</b> <b>older</b> adults requires greater research and clinical attention. The current trend of aging populations suggests the need for greater emphasis on the spiritual wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>older</b> populations. The article addresses the need for health care practitioners to acquire spiritual knowledge and skills in understanding the spiritual needs <b>of</b> <b>older</b> adults during therapeutic processes...|$|R

Following {{the growing number}} <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons in Malaysia recently, issue of religious commitment <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons has been an interesting issue to be discussed.

Using a non-probability sampling technique, a total <b>of</b> 70 <b>older</b> residents aged 50 years and above in Felda Chiku 1, Kelantan were selected as respondent. Results of the study show that almost all <b>of</b> <b>older</b> women have high level of religious commitment.
