5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|Evan Ross Katz from Mic {{described}} the video as a [...] "highly spiritual journey" [...] {{like some of}} the singer's previous clips. Justin Harp from Digital Spy {{described the}} clip as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "poignant", adding that it [...] "highlights the theme of loss and ultimately redemption" [...] as enamored in the song. Bustles Shannon Carlin felt that the [...] "emotional" [...] video [...] "will make fans and non-fans look at [...] differently". Carlin compared it to the video of singer Christina Aguilera's 2002 single [...] "Beautiful", which had similar emotional and empowerment visuals, and finally added: [...] "Like Aguilera, Gaga is giving you a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is by stripping back all that pomp and circumstance of her early years and giving fans something raw." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} So Amazin was mixed. Metacritic gave the album a Metascore—a weighted average {{based on the}} impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 59, signifying mixed or average reviews. David Peisner of Maxim gave the album three out of five stars and said that Milian's [...] "talent is real", and commended her [...] "silky and sassy" [...] voice. He praised Cool & Dre's [...] "badass" [...] production, as well as [...] "intoxicating" [...] lead single [...] "Say I". Clover Hope of Billboard wrote that Milian tried to transform from [...] "sweet pop sweetheart" [...] to [...] "peppy urban soulstress", but the album could not [...] "pinpoint her true identity" [...] and could [...] "only [...] the surface <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> really is." [...] Hope praised lead single, [...] "Say I", describing it as [...] "instantly rousing".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also used as the {{penultimate}} number of Cyrus' Wonder World Tour (2009), her first world tour. The performances began with backup dancers in bodysuits marching as they emerged {{from the bottom of}} the stage. The banging of a gong announced Cyrus' arrival. She dressed in a white tank top and shorts, boots, and a metallic vest. Cyrus and the multiple backup dancers performed elaborate dance routines as images on overhead screens depicted geometric patterns. The dancers exited the stage by throwing themselves inside the stage as Cyrus prepared for the next performance. Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, who attended the September 22, 2009, concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, referred to the performance of [...] "See You Again" [...] as an uptempo highlight that was, however, unable [...] "to give her fans a deeper idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is and what her music means".|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is, comes out around Xander. Because she {{is in love with}} him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E

500|$|Gather Together, {{like much}} of African-American literature, depicts Rita's search for self-discovery, identity, and dignity in the {{difficult}} environment of racism, and how she, like other African Americans, were able to rise above it. [...] Rita's search is expressed both outwardly, through her material needs, and inwardly, through love and family relationships. [...] In Caged Bird, despite trauma and parental rejection, Rita's world is relatively secure, but the adolescent young woman in Gather Together experiences the dissolution of her relationships many times. The loneliness that ensues for her is [...] "a loneliness that becomes, at times, suicidal and contributes to her unanchored self". Rita is unsure <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is or what she would become, so she tries several roles in a restless and frustrated way, as adolescents often do {{during this period of}} their lives. Her experimentation was part of her self-education that would successfully bring her into maturity and adulthood. Lupton agrees, stating that Rita survived through trial and error while defining herself as a Black woman. Angelou recognizes that the mistakes she depicts are part of [...] "the fumblings of youth and to be forgiven as such", but young Rita insists that she take responsibility for herself and her child.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{finds himself}} too weak from the poison's effects to pilot the TARDIS to rescue his companions; River is {{inspired}} by the Doctor's sympathy, and finds herself guided by the TARDIS itself to pilot the ship, and rescues Amy and Rory in time. On returning to the café, the trio finds the Doctor near death; he asks River to find [...] "River Song" [...] {{and give her a}} message, then whispers something in her ear before he passes away. River, who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond, asks Amy who River Song is; Amy uses the Teselecta to show River her form stored in the robot's database <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is to become. With this, River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life, and passes out. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory take her to a hospital in the far future, leaving the TARDIS-shaped diary as a gift by her bedside, and depart. Later, River is shown becoming an archaeologist so she can find the Doctor herself. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta, but does not reveal this knowledge to Amy or Rory.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

500|$|Across her {{speaking}} appearances, Lightning is {{voiced by}} Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto {{was impressed by}} Lightning, whom she called [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the XIII games portray Lightning as a real person: [...] "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!" [...] Over the course of the XIII trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes [...] "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... into a real warrior".|$|E
500|$|Milian's third studio album, So Amazin', was {{released}} on May 16, 2006. The album's lead single, [...] "Say I", featured rapper Young Jeezy. The single saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number twenty-one in the US. So Amazin debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. Reviews of So Amazin were mixed; critics felt that while Milian claimed that she was displaying the various sides of her personality, the album could [...] "only [...] the surface <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> really is." [...] "Say I" [...] was praised by several critics, and was described as [...] "instantly rousing" [...] and [...] "intoxicating". In June 2006, Milian's representative confirmed {{that she had been}} dropped by Island Def Jam. In an interview with Rap-Up, Milian revealed she was dropped a week after her album {{was released}}. The singer believed it was a [...] "budget cut", and that Island Def Jam Music Group wanted to spend more money on label mate Rihanna. She said, [...] "it was embarrassing. It was a week after my album got put out. I would be in my room {{a lot of the time}} crying by myself." [...] After leaving Def Jam, Milian released her first compilation album, The Best of Christina Milian (2006).|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch her breath, and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E

Her supposed parents were actually researchers-turned-traitors of the Einstürzen organization, and she is tormented by the suggestion that her mentor, Fuyumine, took her in because he was aware <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was, or rather, what she was. She recovers from the shock somewhat thanks to Heine.|$|E
2500|$|Braun said Reese's {{feelings}} toward Zach {{can be summed}} up as a [...] "dear, dear friendship and connection on an intimate but not sexual level". She said that Reese has never had a clear point of view. [...] "One minute I think I am playing a storyline that is going one way, and then there is a detour. So I have to make it clear in my head. Yes, it’s not fun playing the outsider who has nobody, and no strong leg to stand on," [...] said Braun.

2500|$|Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire opined, [...] "The {{outrage over}} the show falling prey to the 'lesbian death trope' was epic—in a season full of death, Lexa became an icon for how LGTBQ {{characters}} and characters of color seem to die an awful lot more than others." [...] TV Guide listed the death {{as one of the}} most important television moments of 2016, arguing that while Lexa was not a main character, she [...] "was critically important to a portion of the population who watched the show: a strong, proudly LGBT character whose sexuality was only a part <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was -- a rarity on TV.", and that her death [...] "sparked a year-long discussion about how, and why, this trope must change." ...|$|E
