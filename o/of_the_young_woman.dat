25|$|Aztec {{marriage}} {{practices were}} similar to those of other Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Mayans. Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional matchmaker (ah atanzah), who would approach the potential bride's family. The parents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal. Brides were expected to be virgins before marriage, although young people of both sex were advised to be celibate.|$|E

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{themes of}} the film {{have been the subject}} of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence. Stephen Prince comments that the horror is [...] "born of the torment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth." [...] As with many horror films, it focuses on the [...] "final girl" [...] trope—the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters: Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver. Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters. The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered—hung on a meathook—and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture. In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film. She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves.|$|E

2500|$|An {{analysis}} of the photograph shows that the fashion and hair style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> are not from the 1880s time frame, but from the early 20th Century.

The information was sourced to an anonymous school teacher who had apparently told Nikolai Anov the story. Anov, already dead, apparently passed it on to Zhovtis. At the end of the article, Zhovtis blamed Stalin's scorched earth policy for the 'unnecessary' death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E

She boasted further that a young heiress fell in love with her, believing her to really be a man, and proposed marriage. [...] This resulted, not surprisingly, in disappointment for both Charke and the hopeful heiress. Although the identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> remains [...] "shadowy", many historians believe that she is indeed [...] "Mrs. Brown". [...] Unable to earn a living in the sanctioned theatres, Charlotte began to work any job she could to support herself and Catherine, but she was always attracted to jobs she could perform as a man. [...] Therefore, she was a valet to Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey, and then even took up as a sausage maker. [...] Anglesey was famous as a bigamist and libertine, and lived with a paramour during Charlotte's employ. Charlotte claimed that when Anglesey was not entertaining guests, the trio would dine together as friendly equals. As a valet's service would indeed be personal, normally including dressing one's master for the day, the entire arrangement would have been quite unusual.

2500|$|Buñuel's final {{film was}} That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), adapted by Buñuel and Carrière from an 1898 novel by Pierre Louÿs called La Femme et le pantin, {{which had already}} been {{used as the basis}} of films {{directed}} by Josef von Sternberg (The Devil is a Woman, 1935) and Julien Duvivier (La Femme et le Pantin, 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor Fernando Rey, appearing in his fourth Buñuel film. Initially, the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> was to be played by Maria Schneider, who had achieved international fame for her roles in Last Tango in Paris and The Passenger, but once shooting started, according to Carrière, her drug usage resulted in a [...] "lackluster and dull" [...] performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Buñuel on the set and her eventual dismissal. Serge Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Buñuel to continue shooting with two different actresses, Angela Molina and Carole Bouquet playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Buñuel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: [...] "If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless". Others, have reported that Carrière had first broached the idea while developing the film's scenario, but had been brushed off by Buñuel as [...] "the whim of a rainy day." ...|$|E
