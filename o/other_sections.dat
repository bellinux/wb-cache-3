5|$|The {{relationships}} of Banksia attenuata within the genus are unclear. When Carl Meissner published his infrageneric arrangement of Banksia in 1856, he placed B.attenuata in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike {{rather than a}} domed head, and in series Salicinae, a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous. This series was discarded in the 1870 arrangement of George Bentham; instead, B.attenuata was placed in section Cyrtostylis, a group of species which did not fit easily {{into one of the}} <b>other</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. <b>Other</b> <b>sections</b> of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E

Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E
