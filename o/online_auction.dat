The ten projects receiving the most votes would each receive $50,000 grants. By April, the RTC was courting large institutions, such as IBM, for funding. Other planned activities designed to raise funds in April and May were a series of potlucks, a writing workshop, a music benefit, an <b>online</b> <b>auction,</b> and a screening of rare 1970s films at activist Jay Blotcher's house. Most of the RTC's funding came from individual donations between $25 and $100, and roughly 60 fundraisers were held in total.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted <b>online</b> <b>auction</b> operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than a year}} later, one of Crosby's game-worn sweaters {{disappeared}}.

The jersey was later found at the Pittsburgh International Airport between {{a piece of equipment}} and a stairwell. Crosby's jersey from his third NHL game was the highest-selling NHL jersey in an auction for Hurricane Katrina relief – it sold for $21,010. During an <b>online</b> <b>auction</b> held by the NHL and the NHL Players Association to benefit Hockey Fights Cancer, Crosby's game-worn jersey from the first period of the 2007 All-Star Game earned the most money. Crosby's sold for $47,520, more than eight times the next highest price—$5,681 for the jersey worn by Brendan Shanahan of the New York Rangers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Shilling {{behaviors}} {{are one of}} the most serious fraud problems in <b>online</b> <b>auctions,</b> which make winning bidders have to pay more than what they should pay for auctioned items. In concurrent <b>online</b> <b>auctions,</b> where multiple auctions for the same type of items are running simultaneously, shilling behaviors can be even more severe because detecting, predicting and preventing such fraudulent behaviors become very difficult. In this paper, we propose a formal approach to detecting shilling behaviors in concurrent <b>online</b> <b>auctions</b> using model checking techniques. We first develop a model template that represents two concurrent <b>online</b> <b>auctions</b> in Promela. Based on the model template, we derive an auction model that simulates the bidding processes of two concurrent auctions. Then we use the SPIN model checker to formally verify if the auction model satisfies any questionable behavioral properties that are written in LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formulas. Thus, our approach simplifies the problem of searching for shilling behaviors in concurrent <b>online</b> <b>auctions</b> into a model checking problem. Finally, we provide a case study to illustrate how our approach can effectively detect possible shill bidders. ...|$|R

These two behaviors (multiple bidding and late bidding) are of “strategic ” importance to <b>online</b> <b>auctions</b> and hence important to investigate. In this article we empirically measure the distribution of bid timings and the extent of multiple bidding in a large set of <b>online</b> <b>auctions,</b> using bidder experience as a mediating variable. We use data from the popular auction site www. eBay. com to investigate more than 10, 000 auctions from 15 consumer product categories. We estimate the distribution of late bidding and multiple bidding, which allows us to place these product categories along a continuum of these metrics (the extent of late bidding and the extent of multiple bidding). Interestingly, the results of the analysis distinguish most of the product categorie...|$|R
