5|$|Because {{a number}} of the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Table had regular {{newspaper}} columns, the activities and quips of various Round Table members were reported in the national press. This brought Round Tablers widely into the public consciousness as renowned wits.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Table members, {{it was perhaps}} inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E

5|$|In the Arthurian legends, each knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Table {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by a heraldic description of a coat of arms. Although these arms could be arbitrary, some characters were traditionally associated with one coat or a few different coats.|$|E
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold than <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>round,</b> {{as the former}} proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>round</b> ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St Petka in Ruse, {{opened in}} 1944, was {{built as a}} {{reconstruction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church in Preslav. The Round Church underwent partial restoration in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In December 2009, plans were announced to reconstruct the church in its entirety, without demolishing or altering any of the original structural remains. A monument dedicated to Tsar Simeon was unveiled {{in the immediate vicinity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church on 27 May 2007 to honour the 1080th anniversary of his death. Despite not being an active church, it is regularly used for baptisms and weddings.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E

5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Round</b> Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may {{have been based on}} a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E

5|$|In Bronze Age Britain {{this was}} an {{important}} seaport. Eleven Bronze Age Britain round barrows sit on the promontory with two more a little further inland. Eleven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>round</b> barrows were excavated; three by Bushe Fox in 1911–12 and eight by Harold St George Gray in 1919 and 1922. Two appear to be undisturbed. Numerous finds including Early Bronze Age axes and cremation urns were recovered from these tumuli, which have been consistently found to be between 3500 and 4000 years old.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2017, Judah {{announced}} that he would have his first fight in over 3 years on January 21 when he fights journeyman Jorge Luis Munguia (12-7, 4 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout at Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. The bout was an Internet-only pay per view. As expected, Judah won the bout via 2nd-round TKO. Judah connected with power shots from the opening bell, landed a left hook to the head of Munguia in round 2 which dropped it on his back.

In Tales of Ancient Greece Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters.
