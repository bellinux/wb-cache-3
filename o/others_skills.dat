Persons with high EI are typically perceived more positively and they have better social skills. We hypothesize, that during social interaction high EI enhances ability to detect other’s emotional state and controlling own emotional expressions. We suggest, that emotionally intelligent leader’s experience less stress during social leadership situations, since they have better skills in dealing with the related emotional work. Thus the high-EI leaders would be more able to enjoy these situations, but also be more efficient in choosing appropriate expressions for building constructive dialogue. We suggest, that emotionally intelligent leaders show more positive emotional expressions than low-EI leaders. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The indicators of scientific learning skills of teacher are the ability to organize learning problems, to perform monitoring, facilitation of students‟ problem, and competency to perform the evaluation The indicators of scientific learning skills of student are ability to observe, measure, classify, communicate, guest and conclude. The results of the study based scientific learning skills are methodological, conceptualization, understand the concepts learned, apply the concepts learned, and give the meaning of what is learned competencies. This research is mixed method, concurrent embedded model, quantitative primer. The result of the research as follows, the students‟ behavior is better than both mind and heart, it is expected because the measurement of the behavior when at school. Actually the students‟ mind is not as good as behavior. Because the situation is at school, and the school gives high pressure to students‟ behavior, so their behavior is good. The teachers prepare the object study well. They used medias and give some task to the students. The media usually used by the teachers to provide object / learning problems. Through learning media usually the teachers give some tasks to the students. Because the teachers often and even always use the medium of learning, so the skills in the preparation of the object / learning problems are very skillful. Two skills of the students, they are to measure and guest are low compared the <b>others</b> <b>skills.</b> It happened because they rarely do.

40|$|Introduction As educators, we {{reflect on}} our {{teaching}} almost as ‘second nature’ but occasionally something happens that stops {{us in our}} tracks and makes us consider whether we may have ‘missed’ something important. Such was the case recently when I heard that some of my final year students had been unsuccessful in gaining employment within local hospitals. This made me consider what the successful applicants offered that my students had not {{and what was it}} that made the successful applicants more employable. This caused me to reflect on ‘employability’, old school ‘transferable skills’ perhaps but certainly the modern ‘buzz word’ and definitely on the radar for higher education within Wales. But what exactly is it? Is it sneakily and cleverly embedded within our radiography programmes or is it simply presumed to be there, perhaps within clinical education? Clearly if it was in there somewhere, it seemed to be hidden from those radiography services managers who selected new graduates for employment. This raised even more questions - what exactly are they looking for? I currently lead a final year Healthcare Management module within the diagnostic radiography and radiotherapy programmes at Cardiff University which aims to prepare new graduate radiographers for professional practice; however, I began to reflect on whether I should be paying more attention to helping students understand and demonstrate the skills they need in order to become ‘employable’. To understand ‘employability’ from the perspectives of key stakeholders, I designed a project that surveyed managers from various Local Health Boards and explored the students’ own perceptions of employability. As well as addressing these stakeholders’ needs and expectations, Skills Development Having identified the ‘Top 5 ’ attributes of employability that service managers looked for in new graduates, opportunities were offered for students to engage with skills training sessions run by the Students’ Union Skills Development Service. These sessions were: •	Preparation for presentations o	Building confidence in presenting self •	Team working o	Understanding team roles and responsibilities •	Organisational skills and time management o	Prioritising, record keeping and self-motivation •	Problem solving o	Strategies for decision making •	Dealing with difficult people o	Working effectively with <b>others,</b> <b>skills</b> for negotiation Sessions were interactive and lasted for 2 hours. On completion, students were presented with a Certificate of Professional Development, signed by the Vice Chancellor and endorsed by Price Waterhouse Cooper (pwc), for inclusion within their portfolio. Outcomes Participants were asked to evaluate the sessions and for the majority, the sessions were considered to have been of value with comments such as ‘all sessions had something that you could take away with you’ and ‘It helped me to gain and improve upon skills that an employer considers to be important’ However, one recurring recommendation for improvement was that the sessions should be spread over the three years of the degree programmes rather than concentrating on skills development in the final year – ‘would be more beneficial if offered earlier - before we start applying for jobs’. And so… The skills development programme will now be offered as part of the first and final year Professional and Personal Development modules for all Allied Health programmes within the School of Healthcare Sciences at Cardiff University. In year one, students will concentrate on developing their presentation skills along with team working and dealing with difficult people. They will revisit skills development in year 3 and undertake training sessions for organisational skills and problem solving...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensity}} of globalisation requires {{the mobility of}} people worldwide. Collective competencies and knowledge {{of these people are}} highly required in developed knowledge economies to produce economic value. Australia is such a developed economy which is in need of skilled people because it is badly affected by shortages of skills. Low population growth and the ageing population are largely attributed to the critical shortage of skills in its important economic sectors. As such, Australia has been pursuing a policy of attracting skilled people from across the globe to meet its human capital needs. The immigrant population in Australia comprises diverse people from different language and nationality backgrounds. Immigrants leave their country of origin with new hopes to have a better life in the country of destination like Australia. But after their arrival, they often face difficulty in getting integrated in the mainstream Australian society as well as in their workplaces. The integration problems of immigrants have received attention of academics, researchers and policy makers in the ways of political discourse, public debate and academic research. However, most of the scholarly works have addressed integration issues of immigrants (in Australia) either in a social or in a wider labour market context. And, in such research, differences of skills and attributes of immigrants and their effects have mostly been analysed from the perspective of immigrants’ earning disparity (Antecol, Cobb-Clark, & Trejo, 2003; Chiswick & Miller, 2010; Hawthorne, 2001; Junankar, Paul, & Yasmeen, 2010; Parasnis, Fausten, & Cheo, 2008). Issues relating to integration of immigrants in the Australian workplace context have not received adequate scholarly attention. This study has filled that gap by focusing on skills mismatch of immigrants and its impacts on workplace integration taking various workplace factors into account. Understanding of integration at the workplace/organisational level is vital, because poor workplace integration frustrates immigrants, and affects their productivity, morale and overall performance of the recruiting firms. In examining the workplace integration process this study has engaged mainly the immigrants and the employers in different Australian organisations, and then involves ‘other stakeholders’ such as policy makers, training and education institutions, skills assessing bodies, recruitment agencies, and some other organisations working in the community for diversity/multicultural management. A qualitative research design was adopted to address the research questions. Data were collected through face-face face interviews with the participants to explore the integration process within their real-life contexts with Australian workplaces. Primary data were obtained from skilled immigrants having information technology [IT] and engineering backgrounds and managers across six organisations of Australia. Data were also collected from ‘other stakeholders’ to ascertain their important roles in facilitating integration of skilled immigrants in the workplace. In addition, secondary sources of data have been used to complement the primary data. The research findings demonstrate that the particular technical, language and communication skills immigrants from IT and engineering backgrounds hold are often found inadequate in Australian workplace. The difference of skills requirement between immigrants’ home country and Australian context has been discerned as the main reason. In such a situation they are often undervalued in getting career positions commensurate with their credentials and skills. This undervaluation in turn affects their morale and thinking pattern which have negatively affected their integration in the workplace. Differing societal cultures of most of the immigrants with respect to the host Australian culture are also disadvantageous to immigrants in their integration process. With regard to the roles of all key stakeholders in the integration process, this study suggests that although immigrants {{play an important role in}} closing the gaps between their available skills/attributes and the demand of employers, they are often too engaged in mind and heart with their own cultural values/customs. As such they lack enthusiasm in taking initiative for building social capital in Australia. The employer is another important stakeholder group who offers a range of general training facilities but those are not well targeted to immigrants to facilitate them being integrated in the workplace. Likewise, Policy makers are more concerned about the pre-migration strategies rather than post-arrival supports. Among <b>others,</b> <b>skills</b> assessing bodies and education and training institutions assist immigrants from their own positions. However the lack of a well synergised policy and coordination among different stakeholders in extending their efforts to help integration of immigrants results in less than expected outcomes. The principal practical implications of the study are threefold. First, necessary policies and programs at the federal and state government level need to be in place to assist immigrants in understanding the Australian workplace systems, cultures and values so that integration in the workplace becomes smoother for immigrants. Second, policy makers need to take comprehensive inputs from employer groups in order to incorporate their specific requirements into the overseas skills assessment process. They also need to make sure that different stakeholders' efforts are conducted in a concerted way to facilitate immigrants in getting integrated in the workplace. Third, immigrants themselves have major responsibilities in understanding the differences of work environment, job requirement, the way of communication, and culture in Australia, and act accordingly for their effective integration in the workplace...|$|E

40|$|A {{national}} policy for herbal medicine Cue: Traditional healers and hospital doctors are {{often seen as}} rivals, who sometimes show little respect for each <b>other?s</b> <b>skills</b> and experience. In The Gambia, however, the government is taking a different attitude. It recognises the value of traditional, herbal medicine as practised by hundreds of traditional healers, and wants to integrate this into the national health policy. This raises many challenging issues. How can people be protected against bad practice, which may cause harm rather than cure? Is it possible to impose standards on traditional healers? Can they be regulated, and can the prices paid for their services be controlled? Inclusion of herbal medicine into {{national policy}} {{is not just a}} task for the health ministry. Others will also need to be involved, including ministries responsible for the environment, agriculture and trade. Bubacarr Sillah of the National Traditional Medicine Programme explained to Ismaila Senghore how this is being done in The Gambia. IN:		?We {{are in the process of}} developing ? OUT:		? traditional medicine in this country. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 01 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Bubacarr Sillah of The Gambia?s Traditional Medicine Programme. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sillah	We are in the process of developing a national traditional medicine policy to protect consumer rights, to protect the intellectual property rights of these practitioners and at the same time to put in standards in the practice. These are some of our major considerations that prompted the development of a traditional medicine policy in The Gambia. Senghore	What would be the relationship between traditional medical practice and modern medicine? Sillah	Well the relation is something that WHO is opting for at the moment. In fact the policy is trying to address that issue, integration of traditional medicine into the healthcare delivery system of The Gambia, because by that we can complement government?s effort in promoting health in The Gambia. Senghore	Now have you foreseen in the policy the possibility of creating structures or organisations that can allow maximum access, for example, to all who may need or require herbal medicine at a reasonable cost? Sillah	What we are doing at the moment, we are trying to sensitise traditional healers, organising them into registered organisations and by that we can regulate their practice to make sure that they practise in conformity with what is required in the policy, to make traditional medicine accessible to the community, affordable and nonetheless not compromise its quality. Senghore	Will you be interested to make them, for example, come into associations like cooperatives in order to be able to produce some of these medicinal plants which may prove effective in medical cure? Sillah	We have been trying to do that, to organise them, at the same time to encourage them but we have some challenges. That is, people are not investing in traditional medicine in The Gambia, that is the problem. So if people were investing in traditional medicine in The Gambia, we would have developed gardens, botanical gardens for them. At the same time we would have helped them to process some of the medicines but unfortunately there is not much investment in traditional medicine. So it is very very difficult at the moment, but nonetheless we are considering all options and trying to get partners who are willing to come and help. Senghore	What about the environment, because we know these are medical products that come from herbs and plants and trees and if we extract them from the environment in a manner that is not conducive to environmental preservation in the long run it may not be sustainable. So are those things being put into consideration? Sillah	Of course, we are very much considering that. In fact it is one of the greatest threats to traditional medicine in this country, because deforestation, logging, bush fires, virtually we are losing most of these herbal plants in this country and eventually that is reflecting on the cost of traditional medicine, which should not be the case because usually people resort to traditional medicine because of its affordable cost. But because of scarcity of these plants now, and most of them on the verge of extinction, the traditional healers have to travel far distances to get some of these medicaments for their patients and this reflects on the cost. So this is why really we are very much considering if it is possible to try and rejuvenate our forest and at the same time make sure that we come up with other options of cultivating traditional herbal plants in this country. Senghore	Now do you come across any other major constraints? I know you have talked about investment; people are not easily willing to invest in traditional medicine. Now are there any other major constraints that may prohibit the development and implementation of the products? Sillah	Presently the major problem is, the financial support is very minimal indeed. Government is trying to help us but really the capacity is yet to be developed. That is one major setback and other inhibiting factors to the promotion of traditional medicine in this country, as I was telling you is deforestation. The other factor is illiteracy. Almost 95 % of traditional healers in this country are all illiterates and we all know the impact of illiteracy on any development. It is very difficult for these traditional healers to organise themselves, even to keep records is a problem. So because of that it is very difficult indeed to promote traditional medicine when you have a vast majority of traditional healers being illiterate. Another thing is ageing; this practice is restricted to old people and the unfortunate thing is compounded with illiteracy; they do not make documentation of their practice. Senghore	In other words the knowledge can be lost? Sillah	Yes the knowledge can be lost and it is not transferred. And because practitioners are not gaining much, their children see that their parents are not getting much from it. So they are not keen at learning the skills. So eventually the old people are dying with their skills and this, as a result, is bringing down traditional medicine which might eventually lead to total obliteration in The Gambia. Senghore	Therefore on a final note do you see light at the end of the tunnel when this policy is finally drawn up and it?s been implemented? Sillah	Yes for sure indeed, when this policy is finally drawn up, we hope really this will regulate the practice and at the same time it will encourage other people to come into the scene to promote traditional medicine in this country. End of track. The government of The Gambia has a draft policy to integrate traditional healers into the national health system...|$|E
