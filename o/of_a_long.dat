40|$|AbstractThe length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>longest</b> {{cycle in}} <b>a</b> {{threshold}} graph is obtained in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> largest matching in a specially structured bipartite graph.

Moreover, the difference of the length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>longest</b> cycle and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>longest</b> dominating cycle in a 1 -tough cycle-dominable graph may be made arbitrarily large.
