40|$|Abstract. The KSTAR {{device is}} a tokamak with a fully superconducting (SC) magnet system, which enables an {{advanced}} quasi-steady-state <b>operation.</b> <b>Initial</b> <b>operation</b> of the KSTAR SC magnet {{system has been}} accomplished for the first plasma discharge operation. The SC magnet system consists of 16 toroidal field (TF) coils and 14 PF coils, magnetic structures, SC buslines, current leads, and monitoring and protection system. One of {{the uniqueness of the}} KSTAR device is using the Nb 3 Sn superconductor both in 16 TF coils and in 10 PF coils except 4 PF coils made of NbTi. The objectives of the commissioning of the superconducting magnet are to verify the engineering reliability of all the superconducting magnets at the operating conditions and to develop the operational controllability for the successful plasma startup. The target parameters of the <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> are TF coil current of 15 kA, PF coil current up to 4 kA and PF blip and feedback control using plasma control system (PCS). All the superconducting magnets were operated reliable without any severe failure to preventing the first plasma operational target. The TF magnet was operated reliably up to 15 kA for 8 hours and the temperature rising of TF magnet is less than 0. 1 K. There was no quench during operation including slow and fast discharges. As the PF commissioning, the controllability of each power supply has been tested by using dummy copper load and each SC PF coil. After the individual test of the PF coil and power supply, integrated control was accomplishe...|$|R
40|$|Under {{contract}} to the Department of Energy (DOE), Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) {{has been developing}} the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The use of Stirling technology introduces a four-fold increase in conversion efficiency over Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs), and thus the ASRG in an attractive power system option for future science missions. In August of 2008, the ASRG engineering unit (EU) was delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). The engineering unit design resembles that of a flight unit, {{with the exception of}} electrical heating in place of a radioisotope source. Prior to delivery, GRC personnel prepared a test station continuous, unattended operation of the engineering unit. This test station is capable of autonomously monitoring the unit's safe operation and recording., [...] , [...] performance data. Generator parameters recorded include temperatures, electrical power output, and thelmal power input. Convertor specific parameters are also recorded such as alternator voltage, current, piston amplitude, and frequency. Since November 2008, the ASRG EU has accumulated over 4, 000 hours of <b>operation.</b> <b>Initial</b> <b>operation</b> was conducted using the AC bus control method in lieu of the LMSSC active power factor connecting controller. Operation on the LMSSC controller began in February 2009. This paper discusses the entirety of ASRG EU operation thus far, as well as baseline performance data at GRC and LMSSC, and comparison of performance using each control method...|$|R

The configuration of the Ulysses payload is illustrated, and the flight to orbit {{is described in}}cluding a three-hour on-orbit checkout. The first contact was reported at the Deep Space Network station followed by an adjustment of the spacecraft solar-aspect angle and the acquisition of ranging and Doppler data. In-orbit operations include the earth acquisition maneuver, a trajectory correction maneuver, and a payload switch. Continuous data gathering is discussed with reference to the Jupiter encounter and the first and second oppositions and conjunctions. The data-gathering components comprise ground stations, a data-processing computer, and a data-records system. Data production is performed in an off-line mode that does not interfere with the real-time operations...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Adhesive {{intestinal}} obstruction (AIO) {{is rare in}} the pediatric age group and its treatment is still controversial. This is a retrospective review of our experience in infants and children with AIO. Patients and Methods. The records of infants and children with AIO between January 2001 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed for age at diagnosis, sex, <b>initial</b> <b>operation,</b> interval between <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> and presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Results. 44 infants and children were admitted with AIO. There were 28 males and 16 females who had 46 episodes. Their ages at presentation ranged from 1 month to 12 years (mean 5. 4 years), while their ages at <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> ranged from 2 days to 12 years (mean 4. 15 years). Time elapsed from <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> to presentation ranged from 7 days to 8 years (mean 1. 5 years), and 66 % developed AIO within 1 year from <b>initial</b> <b>operation.</b> Appenedecectomy was the commonest operation (29. 5 %). Four (9 %) responded to conservative treatment. The other 40 (91 %) required surgical intervention. Twenty-nine had release of adhesions only, while 10 (25 %) had resection of small intestines and one underwent stricturoplasty. Two developed recurrence and one died. Conclusions. AIO is rare in the pediatric age group and the majority becomes symptomatic within 1 year of operation. Appendecectomy is the commonest operation leading to AIO. The place of conservative treatment is limited and to obviate delay and decrease the chance of intestinal ischemia, they should be treated early with surgical adhesiolysis...|$|R

Most of the water supply services are provided by Government organization through community management approach which proves unsustainable for long term. Government of Bangladesh completed a pilot project funded by the World Bank adopting an innovative approach of engaging private sponsors in planning, implementing and operating of their schemes commercially. 21 schemes has been implemented in rural villages of the country, which provides various level of services such as, multi tap connection, single tap connection, shared tap or stand post connection. Schemes implemented through the partnership approach among private entity and government agency in which 70 % of the scheme capital cost borne by Govt. through project and remaining 30 % by the community and private sponsor jointly.

40|$|Purpose Previously, we {{established}} a pre-operative risk scoring system to predict contralateral inguinal hernia {{in children with}} unilateral inguinal hernias. The current study aimed to verify the usefulness of our pre-operative scoring system. Methods This was a prospective study of patients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair from 2006 to 2009 at a single institution. Gender, age at <b>initial</b> <b>operation,</b> birth weight, <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> side, and the pre-operative risk score were recorded. We analyzed the incidence of contralateral inguinal hernia, risk factors, and the useful-ness of our pre-operative risk scoring system. The follow-up period was 36 months. We used forward multiple logistic regression analysis to predict contralateral hernia. Results Of the 372 patients who underwent unilateral hernia repair, 357 (96. 0 %) were completely followed-up for 36 months, and 23 patients (6. 4 %) developed a contralateral hernia. Left-sided hernia (OR = 5. 5, 95 %, CI = 1. 3 – 24. 3, p = 0. 023) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of contralateral hernia. The following covariates were not associated with contralateral hernia development: gender (p = 0. 702), age (p = 0. 215), and birth weight (p = 0. 301). The pre-operative risk score (cut-off point = 4. 5) of the patients with a contralateral hernia was significantly higher, compared with the patients without a contralateral hernia using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (p = 0. 024). Conclusions Using multivariate analysis, we confirmed usefulness of our pre-operative scoring system and initial side of the inguinal hernia, together, for the prediction of contralateral inguinal hernia in children...|$|R
