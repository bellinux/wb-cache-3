40|$|Background: Basal cell {{carcinoma}} of the axilla, {{an area that is}} not usually exposed to the sun, is rare. Individuals with basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a disorder associated with a mutation in the patch 1 (PTCH 1) gene, develop numerous basal {{cell carcinoma}}s. Purpose: To describe a woman with basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> who developed a pigmented basal cell carcinoma in each of her axilla and to review the features of axillary basal cell carcinoma patients with Goltz-Gorlin syndrome. Methods: Pubmed was used to search the following terms: axillary basal cell carcinoma and basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The papers and their citations were evaluated. Results: Basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients with basal cell {{carcinoma of the}} axilla were observed in two women; this represents 2. 5 % (2 of 79) of the patients with axillary basal cell carcinoma. Both women had pigmented tumors that were histologically nonaggressive. The cancers did not recur after curettage or excision. Conclusions: Basal cell carcinoma of the axilla has only been described in 79 individuals; two of the patients were women with pigmented tumors who had basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Similar to other patients with axillary basal cell carcinoma, the tumors were histologically nonaggressive and did not recur following treatment. Whether PTCH 1 gene mutation predisposes basal cell nevus patients to develop axillary basal cell carcinomas remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in PATCHED (PTC), {{the human}} homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, have been {{identified}} in most exons of the gene in patients with the basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> and in sporadic basal cell carcinomas. We have screened the 23 PTC exons for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of DNA from 86 basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> probands, 26 sporadic basal cell carcinomas, and seven basal cell nevus syndrome-associated basal cell carcinomas. This screen identified mutations located in eight exons in 13 of the basal cell <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients and in three of the tumors. The most common mutations were frameshifts resulting in premature chain termination. These results provide further evidence for the crucial role of PTC as a tumor suppressor in human keratinocytes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{epidermal}} <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> (ENS) is {{an uncommon}} neurocutaneous disorder in which epidermal nevi {{are found in}} association with congenital abnormalities of the brain, eye, and/or skeleton. The association of epidermal nevi and neurologic abnormalities was comprehensively described by Schimmelpenning 4 in 1957. Pavone et al. 7 (1991) identified a homogeneous variant of ENS with hemimegalencephaly, gyral malformation, mental retardation, seizures and facial hemihypertrophy. We found 57 previously reported cases with the hemimegalencephalic variant of epidermal <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome,</b> in which the most frequent associated features are severe epilepsy, in about half of cases with neonatal onset, mental retardation/developmental delay, ocular/visual involvement, and facial abnormalities. Here we report a 11 -year-old boy with the neurologic variant of ENS with hemimegalencephaly, facial asymmetry, seizures and mental retardation.

40|$|Epidermal <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> (ENS) is a {{rare disease}} {{characterized}} by the association of epidermal nevi with abnormalities in other organs and districts affecting prevalently pediatric patients 1. The first descriptions of an association of epidermal nevi, neurologic disorders and mental retardation were made by Schimmelpenning in 19572 and extensively reviewed in 1975 by Solomon and Esterly. Central nervous system (cortical atrophy, mental retardation, cerebrovascular malformations and neoplasias), skeletal system (bone cysts, scoliosis syndactyly, polydactyly, chinodacctyly) and eyes (choristomas, bilateral cataracts, colobomas) are most commonly involved while endocrine (hypophosphatemic rickets and precocious puberty), cardio-vascular (aneurysms and malformations), urogenital (testicular adenomas, double ureters), oral and skin lesion other than epidermal nevi were also reported 1. It has been determined {{that there is not}} just one category of ENS, distinguished from each other by their clinical features and genetic pattern. In 1995, Happle defined six types of ENS but, for the polymorphism showed by the syndrome, different association of anomalies may be present. Sebaceous <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome,</b> <b>nevus</b> comedonicus <b>syndrome,</b> Becker <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Proteus syndrome, CHILD syndrome are only some examples of the clinical features showed by ENS 3. We reported a case of a patients affected by epidermal <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> with the concomitant presence of oral papillomatosis and cutaneous anomalies including nevi, basal cell carcinoma and siryngocystadenoma without systemic involvement. A concise analysis of the principal epithelial, oral and other lesions associated with ENS and a discussion of the possible relationship between our findings and ENS was performed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The {{organoid}} <b>nevus</b> (sebaceous <b>nevus)</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is characterized}} primarily by cutaneous sebaceous nevus, seizures, and epibulbar choristomas. On {{the basis of}} ophthalmoscopic and computed tomographic studies, a yellow fundus lesion recently observed in this syndrome {{has been called a}} coloboma by some investigators and a choroidal osteoma by others. This study was undertaken to review our personal experience with the organoid <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome,</b> to review the English language literature on the subject, and to address some misconceptions regarding its ocular manifestations. METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients with the organoid <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> who were personally evaluated by the investigators. The ocular findings were studied in more detail, with emphasis on the epibulbar and fundus lesions. RESULTS: We identified five patients with the organoid <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Four had a classic sebaceous nevus in the facial and scalp area, and 2 had seizures and arachnoid cysts. All 5 patients had an epibulbar tumor, which proved to be a complex choristoma in one case that was studied histopathologically. A characteristic ophthalmoscopic feature, observed in the 4 patients with clear ocular media, was a flat yellow discoloration of the posterior fundus, of variable size and shape, which appeared to correlate with a dense plaque noted on ultrasonography and computed tomography. In 1 case, histopathologic examination showed that this posterior lesion contained intrascleral cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations and {{a review of the literature}} indicated that the organoid <b>nevus</b> <b>syndrome</b> has varied manifestations. Like the closely related phakomatoses, it often occurs as a forme fruste, without full expression of the syndrome. The most important ocular manifestations are an epibulbar mass, compatible with a complex choristoma, and focal yellow discoloration in the fundus, probably related to intrascleral cartilage...|$|R
