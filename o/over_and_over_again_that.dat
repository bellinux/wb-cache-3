500|$|In 2006, in {{acknowledgment}} of the [...] "wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website. The developers acknowledged that the Halo series' use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven's Ringworld and Iain M. Banks' Culture series (of which Consider Phlebas and Excession {{were said to be}} particularly influential). In a retrospective article in Edge, Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, [...] "The influence of something like Ringworld isn't necessarily in the design– it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there." [...] Griesemer also explained, [...] "One of the main sources of inspiration was Armor , in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> <b>That</b> sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential." [...] The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley's The Vang; it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name [...] "John 117" [...] may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley's Starhammer, or to the John Spartan character of Demolition Man. An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the Halo franchise commented on similarities between Halo and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game: aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron's film Aliens as a strong cinematic influence.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, with {{encouragement}} from Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, {{and the public}} endorsement of the Chinese government, Puyi wrote his autobiography Wode Qian Bansheng ( [...] ; translated into English as From Emperor to Citizen) together with Li Wenda, {{an editor at the}} People's Publishing Bureau. The ghostwriter Li had initially planned to use Puyi’s “autocritique” written in Fushun as the basis of the book, expecting the job to take only a few months, but he found the “autocritique” used such wooden language as Puyi confessed to a career of abject cowardice, noting <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> he always done the easy thing rather than the right thing in the most leaden prose possible, forcing Li to start anew to produce something more readable as he interviewed Puyi, taking him four years to write the book.

2500|$|According to Pollard 'Dimboola Jim' Phillips was [...] "a fearless umpire who {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for stamping out throwing {{around the turn of}} the [...] century … establishing an international reputation for acumen and honesty." [...] Amongst the bowlers called for throwing by Phillips were Australian Test players Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin. [...] Jones was first no-balled in a match between South Australia and the visiting English side in 1897/98. [...] Phillips again no-balled him once in the 2nd Test of that series, Jones thus becoming the first bowler to be called for throwing in a Test match. [...] The selectors omitted Jack Saunders from the 1905 team to tour England because it was feared that Phillips would no-ball him for throwing. [...] Wisden blamed English umpires for the problem, claiming that [...] "Australian bowlers never threw in England until we had shown them <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> [...] could be broken with impunity." [...] Phillips' actions, including the no-balling of the English amateur champion C. B. Fry, led to a meeting of County captains in 1900, which recommended that nine regular bowlers not be used in the following season.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1688 {{was a time}} {{of massive}} anxiety in English politics. Charles II had died in February 1685, and James II came to the throne later in the same year. James's purported Roman Catholicism and his {{marriage}} to an avowedly Roman Catholic bride roused the old Parliamentarian forces to speak of rebellion again. This is the atmosphere for the writing of Oroonoko. [...] One of the most notable features of the novel is that Oroonoko insists, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> <b>that</b> a king's word is sacred, that a king must never betray his oaths, and that a measure of a person's worth is the keeping of vows. Given that men who had sworn fealty to James were now casting about for a way of getting a new king, this insistence on fidelity must have struck a chord. Additionally, the novel is fanatically anti-Dutch and anti-democratic, even if it does, as noted above, praise faithful former republicans like Trefry over faithless former royalists like Byam. In as much as the candidate preferred by the Whig Party for the throne was William of Orange, the novel's stern reminders of Dutch atrocities in Surinam and powerful insistence on the divine and emanate nature of royalty were likely designed to awaken Tory objections.|$|E
2500|$|Tobei {{lived as}} a young child during the Edo period of Japan. He didn't have any parents and lived on the streets and barely survived as a child.

Everyone who came to meet him told him <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> he should [...] "just die" [...] and [...] "go to hell". He was often abused and tortured by the townsfolk. As he grew up he learned he had to steal things, including lives, or he wouldn't survive. Eventually, he ended up going into murderous rages and killed everyone who was in his way. He was soon caught after killing so many people and was beheaded at sixteen. Since his death, Tobei had been living in Hell for 300 years, tortured by Ose so he can [...] "repent for his sins". Tobei has tried to escape Hell numerous times, but was always caught by Ose. One day he was offered by Lady Ema that if he could collect 108 sins in 108 days then he could be free to return to the earth. He hastily takes the opportunity without thinking of the consequences.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> <b>that</b> some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
