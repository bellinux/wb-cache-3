40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to study}} the {{prevalence}} of co-medication of statins in patients receiving oral blood glucose-lowering drugs by age and gender. Method: Treatment with <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> {{was used as a}} surrogate endpoint for the presence of type 2 diabetes. Data on patients with at least one prescription of <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> in the period 2004 - 2006 were retrieved from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Information on dispensation of statins in the same calendar year was also obtained. Long-term users of <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> were defined as patients filling a prescription of these drugs the year prior to the year of observation. Results: In 2006, a total of 76 288 users of oral blood glucose-lowering drugs were registered as long-term users. 57. 0 % men and 49. 7 % women of long-term users received a statin. 15 646 patients were new users of <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> in 2006. 45. 5 % men and 34. 9 % women of new users received a statin. The proportion of statin users increased with age and was higher in men than in women in all age groups.

40|$|Background: Poor {{adherence}} to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> {{has a negative}} influence on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Real Time Medication Monitoring (RTMM) combines real time monitoring of patients’ medication use with SMS reminders sent only if patients forget their medication, aiming to improve adherence. This study aimed to investigate {{the effect of these}} SMS reminders on {{adherence to}} <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> in patients using RTMM and investigate patients’ experiences with RTMM. Methods: Data were collected in a RCT involving 104 type 2 diabetes patients with suboptimal adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics.</b> Fifty-six patients were randomised to receive SMS reminders if they forgot their medication, 48 patients received no reminders. Primary outcome measure was adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> registered with RTMM, measured as: (1) days without dosing; (2) missed doses; (3) doses taken within predefined standardized time windows. Patients’ experiences were assessed with written questionnaires. Results: Over the six-month study period, patients receiving SMS reminders took significantly more doses within predefined time windows than patients receiving no reminders: 50 % vs. 39 % within a 1 -h window p = 0. 003) up to 81 % vs. 70 % within a 4 -h window (p = 0. 007). Reminded patients tended to miss doses less frequently than patients not reminded (15 % vs. 19 %, p = 0. 065). Days without dosing were not significantly different between the groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Innovative {{approaches}} {{are needed to}} support patients' adherence to drug therapy. The Real Time Medication Monitoring (RTMM) system offers real time monitoring of patients' medication use combined with short message service (SMS) reminders if patients forget to take their medication. This combination of monitoring and tailored reminders provides opportunities to improve adherence. This article describes the design of an intervention study aimed at evaluating the effect of RTMM on adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics.</b> Methods/Design Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) with two intervention arms and one control arm involving diabetes type 2 patients with suboptimal levels of adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> (less than 80 % based on pharmacy refill data). Patients in the first intervention arm use RTMM including SMS reminders and a personal webpage where they can monitor their medication use. Patients in the second intervention arm use RTMM without SMS reminders or webpage access. Patients in the control arm are not exposed to any intervention. Patients are {{randomly assigned to one}} of the three arms. The intervention lasts for six months. Pharmacy refill data of all patients are available from 11 months before, until 11 months after the start of the intervention. Primary outcome measure is adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> calculated from: 1) data collected with RTMM, as a percentage of medication taken as prescribed, and as percentage of medication taken within the correct time interval, 2) refill data, taking the number of days for which <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> are dispensed during the study period divided by the total number of days of the study period. Differences in adherence between the intervention groups and control group are studied using refill data. Differences in adherence between the two intervention groups are studied using RTMM data. Discussion The intervention described in this article consists of providing RTMM to patients with suboptimal adherence levels. This system combines real time monitoring of medication use with SMS reminders if medication is forgotten. If RTMM proves to be effective, it can be considered for use in various patient populations to support patients with their medication use and improve their adherence.

DESIGN Cross sectional descriptive study. METHODOLOGY Face to face interviews were conducted with diabetic patients, health staff and pharmacists working in hospital and community pharmacies closest to the clinics. RESULTS Eighteen health workers were interviewed in seven diabetes clinics. No pharmacist was found to work in the diabetes clinics. Insulin (human and animal) and limited <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> were found in four clinics. Drugs were dispensed by doctors and nurses, while pharmacists were found to manage drug ordering, preparing drug budgets and disposal of expired drugs. The sources of the drugs for people living with diabetes were hospital pharmacy, donations and procurement mainly from MSD. Vlll Respondents were 115 patients aged between 10 and 80 years of whom 68 were females and 47 males. 31. 3 % of them were on insulin, 61. 7 % were on <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics,</b> 0. 9 % on both (insulin and <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics)</b> and 6. 1 % were on diet. Majority of patients on insulin (97. 3 %) and of those on <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> (42 %) knew the names of the drugs they used. (All patients knew how to use their medicines. Most patients (91. 8 %) on insulin stored it correctly, 83. 7 % knew the units of insulin they were using but only 21. 6 % were able to mention the type/source of insulin they were using. 40 % of patients said drugs were available at the clinic, but only 17. 4 % of these said drugs were always available. Most patients(76 %) knew the risks of not taking their medication and majority knew the symptoms of hypoglycaemia (63. 5 %) and hyperglycaemia (76 %). The complications of diabetes were known to 64 % of patients and 72 % could tell what can improve their health as diabetic patients. Majority of patients mentioned doctors and nurses to be their source of health education about the disease while pharmacists were mentioned on storage and use of drugs. A total of 51 pharmacies were visited, where 96 % of the interviewees were pharmacists. A variety of <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> were found in stock and 63 % of the pharmacies stocked insulin (animal and human). 11. 8 % pharmacists had attended training in diabetes after graduating.

40|$|Background: Non-adherence is a {{major public}} health problem. Despite {{the large amount of}} {{research}} in this area there is still need for research on determinants of non-adherente. For example, the influence of prescribers on adherence in their patient population is not clear. Objectives: 1) To identify risk profiles for non-adherence to <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics,</b> antihypertensives and antidepressants from patients' socio-demographic characteristics, frequency of GP consultation, and use of comedication 2) To explore variation in adherence rates between general practices. Methods: Data were obtained by linkage of a general practice to a dispensing database in 2001. We identified 3548 users for <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics,</b> 20004 for antihypertensives,and 7365 for antidepressants listed in 79 general practices. Adherence was defined as nuinber of days for which the drug was dispensed divided by number of days between start and theoretical end date in users with 3 + prescriptions. Compliance < 80 % was defined as non-adherence. Data were analyzed using multilevel models. Results: 7. 2 % af users of <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> with 3 + prescriptions was non-adherent. For antihypertensives and antidepressant percentages were 11. 9 % and 25. 4 %. No correlates were found for adherence to antidiabetics. Native Dutch patients were more often adherent to antihypei-tensives (OR = 1. 6) and antidepressants (OR= 2. 1) than nonwestern immigrants. Type of inedication and complexity of medication regime were also correlated with adherence to these two drug groups. The proposition of adherent patients varied across genera 1 practices: for antidiabetics the range was 42 %, for antihypertensives 31 %, for antidepressants 32 %. This variation cannot be explained by differences in patient population. Moreover, general practices with a high proportion of adherent patients for one drug had higher proportions of adherent patients for the other drugs. Conclusions: We did not find clear risk profiles for nonadherence at the patient level. Our results show that risk profiles should include information on the patient's care provider. Future research should provide more insight into GP characteristics (f. e. cornmunication style) associated with their patients' adherence. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes alters {{bone mass}} and/or quality and {{increases}} fracture risk. However, in type 2 diabetes, bone mineral density (BMD) {{is usually not}} diminished, pertaining to increased weight and fat mass, which complicates the diagnosis of osteoporosis by DXA (T-score <- 2. 5). Similarly, estimates of fracture probability by FRAX may underestimate fracture risk in type 2 diabetes. Adequate glycemic control with insulin and/or <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> decreases fracture risk, whereas thiazolidinediones increase it. Eventually, osteoporosis drugs such as bisphosphonates and SERMs seem to have similar efficacy in diabetic and non-diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Optimal therapy of {{diabetes}} {{has to be}} based on the known pathophysiology of metabolic disturbances and should eventually alleviate reduced secretion of insulin as well as reduce the usually present resistance to insulin in order to normalize the average blood glucose levels. In less than 30 % of patients with type-II diabetes, dietetic measures combined with increased physical activity alone, are sufficient for metabolic control, thus increasing the importance of pharmacologic treatment immensely. Biguanides are the therapeutic choice in patients with massive overweight, because they usually do not induce weight gain; however, specific contraindications (renal failure in particular) have to be taken into consideration. The effect of blood glucose lowering by biguanides is not due to increased secretion of insulin, thus neither hypoglycemias nor hyperinsulinism are induced or increased, respectively. Patients with normal or slightly increased body weight should profit best from sulfonylureas that stimulate insulin production. Combinations of sulfonylurea and biguanides or of insulin and <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> or insulin alone have to be taken into account when monotherapy with <b>oral</b> <b>antidiabetics</b> is too inefficient; however, clear and generally accepted guidelines for correct indications of these therapeutic modalities are lacking. Particularly in long-lasting diabetes and for patients with distinct overweight an adequate therapeutic success is often not obtained with the currently available therapeutic means. Possibly, future developments will provide new therapeutic ways with drugs that increase insulin sensitivity or reduce gluconeogenesis...|$|R
