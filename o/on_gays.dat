500|$|California State Senator John Briggs saw an {{opportunity}} in the Christian fundamentalists' campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and {{was impressed with the}} voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to Sacramento, he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling gay journalist Randy Shilts, [...] "It's politics. Just politics." [...] Random attacks <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted [...] "Faggot!" [...] Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at San Francisco City Hall where he called the city a [...] "sexual garbage heap" [...] because of homosexuals. Weeks later, 250,000people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.|$|E

Train released a statement saying the group [...] "strongly opposes any kind of policy that questions the equality of any American citizen ... We look forward to participating in the Jamboree this summer, {{as long as they}} make the right decision before then." [...] In March, entertainer Madonna made a public appearance dressed as a Scout and called for the ban to be lifted.|$|E

2500|$|In Congress, Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia led the {{contingent}} that favored maintaining the absolute ban <b>on</b> <b>gays.</b> Reformers {{were led by}} Democratic Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and Barry Goldwater, a former Republican Senator and a retired Major General, who argued on behalf of allowing service by open gays and lesbians. In a June 1993 Washington Post opinion piece, Goldwater wrote: [...] "You don't have to be straight to shoot straight," [...] after Congressional phone lines were flooded by organized anti-gay opposition, indicating substantial public opposition to Clinton's open service proposal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, he {{switched}} parties and ran in North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, which had absorbed {{a large chunk}} of his father's former territory. His race against incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster was initially very close until Jones released a picture of Lancaster jogging with President Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stands (especially <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> in the military) angered many voters in the district. [...] Although Democrats have a large advantage in registered voters, the 3rd has always had a very strong social conservative tint; Jesse Helms in particular had a large base of support there. As part of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Jones defeated Lancaster 53%–47%. [...] With his victory, Jones became the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{said that}} the interim {{document}} - which softened the Catholic Church's language <b>on</b> <b>gays,</b> contraception and divorced and civilly remarried people - showed that [...] "a great number of the Synod Fathers found it objectionable". In an interview with Catholic World Report, Burke said the document [...] "lacks a solid foundation in the Sacred Scriptures and the Magisterium (the teaching authority of the Catholic Church) and gives the impression of inventing a totally new, what {{one member of the}} Synod called ‘revolutionary’, teaching on marriage and the family." [...] Burke went on to say, in an interview with BuzzFeed, that if [...] "Pope Francis had selected certain cardinals to steer the meeting so as to advance his personal views on matters like divorce and the treatment of LGBT people", he would not be observing his mandate {{as the leader of the}} Catholic Church.|$|E

2500|$|Relationship {{psychologist}} Anne Peplau {{took the}} stand and argued that individuals gain physical, psychological, and social benefits from being married. Edmund A. Egan, the chief economist for San Francisco, agreed {{and said that the}} citizen's improved health would save city emergency health funds. She also argued that the quality and stability of same-sex relationships {{are similar to those of}} heterosexual relationships and that permitting same-sex couples to marry will not harm the institution of marriage in any way. Peplau was cross-examined by Nicole Moss, who asked Peplau about the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships, but Peplau reiterated there are no significant differences. The plaintiffs also called forward Dr. Ilan H. Meyer, Senior Scholar of Public Policy at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at the UCLA School of Law, to testify on the mental and psychological harms of being denied the right to marry. [...] "Young children do not aspire to be domestic partners, marriage is a common, socially approved goal," [...] he said. He then explained the effects of minority stress <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians.|$|E
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E
