5|$|Local {{government}} for the town <b>of</b> <b>Reading</b> is principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough <b>of</b> <b>Reading,</b> and the parliamentary constituencies <b>of</b> <b>Reading,</b> Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies <b>of</b> <b>Reading</b> East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E

40|$|Many {{assemblers}} {{carry out}} heuristic based overlap detection to avoid string comparisons. But heuristics skips many true overlaps. Also, {{the order of}} the number <b>of</b> <b>read</b> pairs compared for overlaps is higher than the order of n. In the raw approach it would be n 2 where every read is compared to every other read. Some assemblers have used a hybrid approach to bring the order down from n 2. Here is an algorithm which works with 100 % accuracy. As there is no heuristics involved, it is able to report all the overlaps in a given set <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> without actual string comparisons. It achieves this purely by querying the k-mer position data. Moreover, the number <b>of</b> <b>read</b> pairs compared is proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> present i. e. of the order of n...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a whole-genome assembly program named PCAP for processing tens <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>reads.</b> The PCAP program has several features to address efficiency and accuracy issues in assembly. Multiple processors {{are used to}} perform most time-consuming computations in assembly. A more sensitive method is used to avoid missing overlaps caused by sequencing errors. Repetitive regions <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> are detected {{on the basis of}} many overlaps with other <b>reads,</b> instead <b>of</b> many shorter word matches with other reads. Contaminated end regions <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> are identified and removed. Generation of a consensus sequence for a contig is based on an alignment <b>of</b> <b>reads</b> in the contig, in which both base quality values and coverage information are used to determine every consensus base. The PCAP program was tested on a mouse whole-genome data set <b>of</b> 30 million <b>reads</b> and a human Chromosome 20 data set of 1. 7 million reads.

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, civic {{administration}} {{for the town}} <b>of</b> <b>Reading</b> was situated in the Yield Hall, a guild hall situated by the River Kennet near today's Yield Hall Lane. After a brief stay in what later became Greyfriars Church, the town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium <b>of</b> <b>Reading</b> Abbey. For some 400 years up to the 1970s, this was to remain the site of Reading's civic administration through the successive rebuilds that eventually created today's Town Hall. In 1976, Reading Borough Council moved to the new Civic Centre. In 2014, they moved again to civic offices in a refurbished existing office building on Bridge Street, {{in order to facilitate}} the demolition and redevelopment of the previous site.|$|E
5|$|Reading may {{date back}} to the Roman {{occupation}} of Britain, possibly as a trading port for Calleva Atrebatum. However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town {{came to be known as}} Readingum. The name probably comes from the Readingas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose name means Reada's People in Old English, or less probably the Celtic Rhydd-Inge, meaning Ford over the River. In late 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the first Battle <b>of</b> <b>Reading,</b> King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence <b>of</b> <b>Reading.</b> The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.|$|E
