50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{concentration}} risk. These types are based on the sources of the risk.

40|$|In the case-crossover design, only {{cases are}} sampled and the hazard ratio is {{estimated}} from within-subject comparisons <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> {{at the event}} time and in M control periods prior to the event. We consider the effect of within-subject dependence <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> in successive time periods. We show that estimates obtained from the conditional logistic model are biased. This bias disappears if the distribution <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> in the M+ 1 successive time intervals is exchangeable. In contrast, the Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the odds ratio is approximately unbiased provided that exposures are stationary. Suitable methods of analysis of case-crossover designs using maximum likelihood may be derived from cohort rather than case-control models. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We derive an {{analytic}} approximation to {{the credit}} loss distribution of large portfolios by letting the number <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> tend to infinity. Defaults and rating migrations for individual exposures are driven by a factor model in order to capture co-movements in changing credit quality. The limiting credit loss distribution obeys the empirical stylized facts of skewness and heavy tails. We show how portfolio features like the degree of systematic risk, credit quality and term to maturity affect the distributional shape of portfolio credit losses. Using empirical data, {{it appears that the}} Basle 8 % rule corresponds to quantiles with confidence levels exceeding 98 %. The limit law's relevance for credit risk management is investigated further by checking its applicability to portfolios with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>exposures.</b> Relatively homogeneous portfolios <b>of</b> 300 <b>exposures</b> can be well approximated by the limit law. A minimum <b>of</b> 800 <b>exposures</b> is required if portfolios are relatively heterogeneous. Realistic loan portfolios often contain thousands <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> implying that our analytic approach can be a fast and accurate alternative to the standard Monte-Carlo simulation techniques adopted in much of the literature. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to surface predators.|$|E
