5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} the crash <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 1907 began to emerge, the investigation {{seemed to be}} at least partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E

5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues to the location <b>of</b> <b>Flight</b> 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section).

At {{the time of the}} crash, Captain Caviedes had been employed with Avianca for over 27 years and had logged over 16,000 hours <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time, including over 1,500 in the 707.

Klotz had transitioned to the 707 the previous October and had logged 64 flight hours in the airframe, including 13 at night. Flight engineer Moyano had been employed with Avianca for over 23 years and had over 10,000 hours <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> time, including over 3,000 hours in the 707 and over 1,000 hours of night flying in the same airframe.|$|E
