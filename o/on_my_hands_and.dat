500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, two-car garage and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2012, Tyler {{announced}} that he would be leaving American Idol after two seasons, with a statement saying, [...] "After some long... hard... thoughts... I've decided it's time for me to let go of my mistress 'American Idol' before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back— but instead of begging <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, I got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass— the ultimate in auditory takeover..." [...] However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the American Idol bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do American Idol. He was replaced by Keith Urban.|$|E
60|$|I did so, {{though it}} turned me cold all over to touch him. Some of his blood came <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> sickened me.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} I felt her {{pressure}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{then she had}} fled into the house, leaving me standing by the steps looking after her. Comyn's voice aroused me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I walked round by Fowler's lodge, {{to bestow}} my little Athenian owl. I brought {{it all the}} way in <b>my</b> pocket, or <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I put him in Tom Fowler's charge while I am here. I could not think what fashionable young lady you had here. How has that turned out?' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I got down, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{knees and}} went on another {{exploring}} expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rise early, and be by {{me all the}} day. There will be {{much work}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I shall be hurt between my neck and my shoulder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You," [...] she said, [...] "are {{going to}} watch, to observe, {{to trace the}} {{external}} only that you may understand the internal. But I am going to work <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speechless with relief, I nodded. I {{would not}} be arrested or thrown out if they would accept me as a science fiction writer. He kept his grip <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> turned around and {{bellowed}} to his group of chatting friends, [...] "Guess who I've got here. The little woman who wrote 'Incommunicado'!" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{ultimately}} got past my defence, with a jumpy one which broke awkwardly from the off, I had fetched twenty-three {{so that he}} needed twenty to win, a longer hand {{than he had ever}} yet made. As I gave him the bat he looked brave, but something wet fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> then a sudden fear seized me lest David should not win.|$|R
60|$|As {{the days}} went on, I noticed {{more and more}} that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, {{and then it would}} subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then he would answer me with slight {{pressures}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I grew to understand his meaning very well.|$|R
60|$|Elsie shrank {{back against}} the wall of rock. I {{advanced}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees {{to the edge of the}} precipice. It was not quite sheer, but it dropped like a sea-cliff, with broken ledges.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend," [...] said Dalgetty, [...] "I {{am sorry}} for you; but PATIENZA, as the Spaniard says. If you had but been {{as quiet as}} a log, as you call yourself, I should have saved some excoriations <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees." ...|$|E
60|$|The October night comes down; {{returning}} {{as before}} Except for a slight sensation of being {{ill at ease}} I mount the stairs and turn {{the handle of the}} door And feel as if I had mounted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees.|$|E
6000|$|THE ring is <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> [...] <b>And</b> {{the wreath}} is <b>on</b> <b>my</b> brow; [...] Satins and jewels grand [...] Are all at my command, [...] And I am happy now.|$|R
60|$|All this I observed, {{sitting at}} the table in the corner with <b>my</b> head leaning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} running <b>on</b> very different things. The chaise soon came round {{to the front of the}} shop, and the baskets being put in first, I was put in next, and those three followed. I remember it as a kind of half chaise-cart, half pianoforte-van, painted of a sombre colour, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail. There was plenty of room for us all.|$|R
6000|$|Wilfrid at once assented. [...] "Stand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> I will hoist you up." [...] Mr. Atherton raised Wilfrid {{until he}} was able to get on to the ledge of rock behind the bushes. Wilfrid laid himself down there, and with his knife cut off a few of the lower twigs so that {{he was able to}} get a good view ahead. [...] "Keep {{yourself}} well back, lad, and do not raise your head except to fire. Do you see anything of them?" ...|$|R
60|$|Misfortunes seldom come alone: {{this was}} the forerunner of my husband's flight; and as my {{expectations}} were cut off on that side, my husband gone, and my family of children <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> nothing to subsist them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express.|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees {{to look for}} him, for I felt very curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused. After a minute's search, I found him sitting {{at the edge of}} the ditch, by the side of the little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] replied Dr. May; [...] "and I made enemies {{enough to}} fetter me now. I {{do not mean}} that I have done right--I have not; {{but there is a}} good deal <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I don't write easily. I have been slower to take up new matters than I ought to have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{portrait}} of myself. That such a picture {{should be in the}} hands of these scoundrels might in any case have caused a mild surprise; but no more. It was no mild surprise that I felt. The likeness was an extremely good one, worked up with all the accessories of the conventional photographic studio. I was leaning <b>my</b> head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> was relieved against a painted landscape of woodland. It was obvious that it was no snapshot; it was clear that I had sat for this photograph. And the truth was that I had never sat for such a photograph. It was a photograph that I had never had taken.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Another lady, Miss H., who was present, {{laughed at}} the whole thing, {{especially}} when Miss ---- insisted <b>on</b> holding <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> patting her other <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> forehead! Miss H. in a scornful manner took up a book, and, crossing {{to the other side}} of the room, left us to our folly.|$|R
6000|$|... 485. *(XI.) The {{monument}} of ice here {{spoken of}} I observed while ascending the middle road {{of the three}} ways that lead from Rydal to Grasmere. It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> eyes were upon it when it fell, as told in these lines.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Emily, in a murmuring voice, 'we {{should do}} better if Lily {{would not make}} such a point of that one thing; but she never minds what else is cut short, and she never thinks of helping me. It never seems to enter her head how much I have <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> no one does {{anything}} to help me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad, I don't know women very well, but I reckon {{they live}} by their hearts. You {{can bet that}} {{happiness}} for them {{means a lot to}} me. I felt pretty low down. That's gone. I could crow like Bobby ... but, Dad, I've a big job <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I think I'm equal to it. Are you going to oppose me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Felice--my father-in-law!...I have crawled to {{you more}} than a mile <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees--God, I thought I should never have got here!...I have come to you--be-cause you are the only friend--I have in the world now....I can never go back to Hintock--never--to the roof of the Melburys! Not poppy nor {{mandragora}} will ever medicine this bitter feud!...If I were only well again--" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she took}} {{scissors}} from her tiring-table, and, bidding me be seated, she cut off my locks, clipping the hair {{close to the}} head. Next she found stains of such sort as women use to make dark the eyes, and mixed them cunningly, rubbing the stuff <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> the white mark in my hair where the sword of Brennus had bitten to the bone.|$|R
60|$|Encouraged by this loneliness, I seated {{myself in}} a recess of a large bow window, which {{admitted}} a broad flood of yellow sunshine, checkered here and there by tints from panes of colored glass, while an open casement let in the soft summer air. Here, leaning <b>my</b> head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> arm <b>on</b> an old oaken table, I indulged {{in a sort of}} reverie about what might have been the ancient uses of this edifice. It had evidently been of monastic origin; perhaps one of those collegiate establishments built of yore for the promotion of learning, where the patient monk, in the ample solitude of the cloister, added page to page and volume to volume, emulating in the productions of his brain the magnitude of the pile he inhabited.|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't real, she's a doll," [...] lisped a crêpe-bonneted {{little girl}} who with skimpy legs {{dangling}} out of her petticoat had been hoisted up under her armpits for a clearer view. I let a little pause come, then turned <b>my</b> head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> smiled, leaned over and eased my tinselled slipper. An audible sigh, sweet as incense, went up under the hollow of the booth. I looked on softly from face to face--another dream. Some captive beast mewed and brushed against the sides of a cage drawn up a yard or two from where I lay. The lamp poured flame and smoke. The canvas quietly flapped, and was still. Wild ramped the merry-go-round with its bells and hootings; and the panpipes sobbed their liquid decoy. The Signorina's first reception was over.|$|R
60|$|I started forward restlessly. I did {{not need}} my sight to pace the poop of my ill-starred first command with perfect assurance. Every square foot of her decks was {{impressed}} indelibly on my brain, to the very grain and knots of the planks. Yet, all of a sudden, I fell clean over something, landing full length <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, and {{threaded}} {{my way through}} the long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as I could. The two old hands watched me. When I emerged several yards off, much to their surprise, Colebrook turned to Doolittle. [...] "Might answer," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Major says, 'Choose your own men.' Anyhow, if they catch him, nobody's fault but his. Wants to go. Will do it." ...|$|E
60|$|I crept <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{knees to}} the box, {{to see what}} queer thing had found {{his way to the}} crackers, and peeped {{cautiously}} over the edge. There were Killooleet, and Mrs. Killooleet, and the five little Killooleets, just seven hopping brown backs and bobbing heads, helping themselves to the crackers. And the sound of their bills on the empty box made the jolliest tattoo that ever came out of a camping kit.|$|E
6000|$|I looked <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{saw there}} was no man that would know [...] me. I {{had no place to}} flee unto, and no man cared for my soul. I [...] cried unto Thee, O Lord, and said, Thou art my Hope. When my spirit [...] was in heaviness, then Thou knewest my path.--Ps. cxlii. 4, 5.|$|R
5000|$|A guest, I answer'd, worthy to be here:Love said, You {{shall be}} he.I the unkinde, ungrateful? Ah, my deare,I cannot look <b>on</b> thee.Love took <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> smiling did reply,Who made the eyes but I? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{her voice}} went low and she whispered," [...] said Mr. Skelmersdale, [...] "and laid 'er <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and,</b> you know, <b>and</b> came {{close with a}} soft, warm {{friendly}} way she 'ad, it was as much as I {{could do to keep}} my 'ead." ...|$|R
