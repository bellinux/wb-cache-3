In the case of a highly <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> <b>medium,</b> the escape of resonance line photons is achieved by a large number of resonant local scatterings followed by a small number of scatterings in the damping wing.

40|$|The Fourier power {{spectrum}} {{is one of}} the most widely used statistical tools to analyze the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellar medium. Lazarian & Pogosyan (2004) predicted that the spectral slope should saturate to - 3 for an <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> <b>medium</b> and many observations exist in support of their prediction. However, there have not been any numerical studies to-date testing these results. We analyze the spatial {{power spectrum}} of MHD simulations with a wide range of sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers, which include radiative transfer effects of the ^ 13 CO transition. We confirm numerically the predictions of Lazarian & Pogosyan (2004) that the spectral slope of line intensity maps of an <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> <b>medium</b> saturates to - 3. Furthermore, for very optically thin supersonic CO gas, where the density or CO abundance values are too low to excite emission in all but the densest shock compressed gas, we find that the spectral slope is shallower than expected from the column density. Finally, we find that mixed optically thin/thick CO gas, which has average optical depths on order of unity, shows mixed behavior: for super-Alfvénic turbulence, the integrated intensity power spectral slopes generally follow the same trend with sonic Mach number as the true column density power spectrum slopes. However, for sub-Alfvénic turbulence the spectral slopes are steeper with values near - 3 which are similar to the very optically thick regime. Comment: accepted to Ap...|$|E

Between June and September of 2001, four Intensive Field Campaigns (IFC) {{of data collection}} were conducted over the forested areas near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Using the CASI sensor, data were collected, in the visible and near infrared domain, over eight selected Jack Pine sites. Supplementing the airborne campaigns, was simultaneous on-site collection of foliage samples for laboratory spectral and chemical measurements. The study first linked needle-level reflectance and pigment content through the inversions of leaf level radiative transfer models such as PROSPECT. Next, the red-edge index (R 750 / 710), was scaled up to the canopy level {{through the use of}} canopy models and infinite reflectance calculations, which simulate the canopy as an <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> vegetation <b>medium.</b> However, for the relatively open and clumped jack pine stands such a simple approach requires careful validation due to the confounding effects of the open canopy structure.

Effectively eliminating these confounding variables will permit the generation of predictive needle pigment content maps for forest condition assessment.

40|$|With Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method, {{we investigate}} the time dependent behavior of Lyα photon transfer in <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> <b>medium</b> of the concordance ΛCDM universe. At high redshift, the Lyα photon escaping from <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> <b>medium</b> has a time scale {{as long as}} the age of the luminous object, or even comparable to the age of the universe. In this case, time-independent, or stationary solutions of the Lyα photon transfer with resonant scattering will overlook important features of the escaped Lyα photons in physical and frequency spaces. More seriously, {{the expansion of the universe}} leads to that the time-independent solutions of the Lyα photon transfer may not exist. We show that time-dependent solutions sometimes are essential for understanding the Lyα emission and absorption at high redshifts. For Lyα photons from sources at redshift 1 +z= 10 and being surrounded by neutral hydrogen IGM of the ΛCDM universe, the escape coefficient is found to be always less, or much less than one, regardless of the age or life time of the sources. Under such environment, we also find that even when the Lyα photon luminosity of the sources is stable, the mean surface brightness is gradually increasing in the first 10 ^ 6 years, and then decreasing with a power law of time, but never approaches a stable, time-independent state. That is, all 1 +z= 10 sources in a neutral Hubble expanding IGM with Lyα luminosity L have their maximum of mean surface brightness 10 ^- 21 (L/(10 ^ 43 erg/s)) erg s^- 1 cm^- 2 arcsec^- 2 at the age of about 10 ^ 6 years.

Candidates for such SNe include Type IIn and superluminous SNe. If some of these SNe are powered by interaction, then there should be a relation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, and shock-breakout velocity. Given that the shock velocity during shock breakout is not measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between the rise time and the peak luminosity of these SNe. Here, we present a sample of 15 SNe IIn for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peak luminosity from observations obtained using the Palomar Transient Factory. We report on a possible correlation between the R-band rise time and peak luminosity of these SNe, with a false-alarm probability of 3 %. Assuming that these SNe are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theory allows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. The lower limits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected for SNe (i. e., ~ 10 ^ 4 km/s). This supports the suggestion that the early-time light curves of SNe IIn are caused by shock breakout in a dense CSM. We note that such a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. Performing such a test on other classes of SNe (e. g., superluminous SNe) can be used to rule out the interaction model for a class of events. Comment: Accepted to ApJ, 6 page...|$|R

We study the spatial distribution and the velocity field of the emitting gas by performing detailed analyses on the line variability using correlations, 1 D and 2 D response functions, and principal component analysis. In both lines we find evidence for two components, one which has the dynamic properties of gas in Keplerian motion around a black hole with a mass of the order of 10 ^ 9 Mo, and one which is characterized by high, blue-shifted velocities at large lag. There is no indication of the presence of <b>optically</b> <b>thick</b> emission <b>medium</b> neither in the Lya, nor in the Civ response functions. The component characterized by blue-shifted velocities, which is comparatively much stronger in Civ than in Lya, is more or less compatible with being the result of gas falling towards the central black hole with free-fall acceleration. We propose however that the line emission at high, blue-shifted velocities is better explained in terms of entrainment of gas clouds by the jet. This gas is therefore probably collisionally excited as a result of heating due to the intense infrared radiation from the jet, which would explain the strength of this component in Civ relative to Lya. This phenomenon might be a signature of disk-jet interaction. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ. Uses aaste...|$|R

Typical column densities and the expansion velocities investigated in this study are NHI ∼ 10 17 − 20 cm − 2 and ∆V ∼ 100 km s − 1. The main features in emergent line profiles include a primary emission peak in the red part and a much weaker secondary peak in the blue part. We investigate the dependence of the profile on the kinematics and on the column density. The primary peak recedes to the red and the width of the feature increases as NHI increases. It is also found that symmetric double peak profiles are obtained in the static limit, where bulk motion is negligible.
