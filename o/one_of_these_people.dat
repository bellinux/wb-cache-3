500|$|Stetson's {{original}} {{concept for}} the New History Warfare trilogy was largely skeletal, and developed as the albums were recorded. New History Warfare Vol. 1 {{was released in}} 2008 and had a narrative concept of a story {{of people who had}} been living at sea for generations. New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, released in 2011, told the story of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> finally arriving on land. New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light expanded on this, with Stetson stating that [...] "it’s a war story. It’s finding your way to this shining beacon on the mountaintop," [...] and that it [...] "deals with death and love." ...|$|E

He also said that [...] "I'm not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> who can have one drink and stop. I want another and another and another." [...] His drink problems began after he developed a gambling habit in 2007. His addiction to betting on horse racing cost him £3,000 a month, and left him asking friends and family for money.|$|E

"Bounce" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} as a digital extended play (EP)—which included a remix by DJ Green Lantern—on 27 May 2013 in selected {{countries such as}} France, while the release in several other countries were postponed to a later date. The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> too– is that they think they work in the industry and know how it all works. They're like, 'put 'Bounce' out now or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'. It's coming out on July 8 and I need fans to trust their fave on this one because it's for the best. I need to hashtag that– #trustyourfaves." [...] The EP was later released on 5 July 2013 in Germany, 7 July 2013 in the United Kingdom, and 8 July 2013 in Italy and Spain.|$|E
500|$|In southeastern Pakistan, an {{estimated}} 6,000 people were evacuated from coastal regions prior to Cyclone Onil's arrival.

Offshore, 163 fishermen were reported to be missing after being caught in the storm. However, reports from Pakistani officials stated that at least 300 fishermen were missing. In other areas, power was lost for more than 48hours after Onil moved through the region. Around Karo Gongro, 100 people were stranded along a major roadway after flash flooding struck the area.|$|E

50|$|For 40,000 {{years there}} have been people living on the {{floodplain}} in the Wiesbach valley, and for 1,500 years, the villages of Armsheim and Schimsheim have stood here. The open land here, scored by brooks, offered Old Stone Age hunter-gatherers ideal living conditions. From the New Stone Age (after 4000 BC), the land was permanently settled. Crop farming and livestock raising underpinned the settlers’ livelihood. Many Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age (specifically from La Tène times) finds show heavy settlement. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people’s</b> centres was formed by lands that now make up the new development area. Surface-level witnesses to this early time are the menhirs, of which, however, only one still stands near its original location.|$|R

To quote Colin Irwin: [...] "They merged the familiar American folk style so popular in the early sixties with a distinctively home-grown Irish flavour; it was not Irish music but it was real and exciting, it had verve, imagination and style." [...] A distinctive aspect of the Sweeney's Men sound was Moynihan's introduction of the bouzoukioriginally a Greek instrumentinto Irish music, albeit with a different tuning: GDAD' (one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin), instead of the modern Greek tuning of CFAD'.|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people.</b> It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
2500|$|During 1648, Cromwell's {{letters and}} speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, {{many of them}} meditations {{on the meaning of}} {{particular}} passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that [...] "they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read Isaiah 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of Gideon's defeat of the Midianites at Ain Harod. These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the king at the Treaty of Newport, that convinced him that God had spoken against both the king and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument. The episode shows Cromwell’s firm belief in [...] "Providentialism"—that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of [...] "chosen people" [...] (whom God had [...] "provided" [...] for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{excavations}} in the Soconusco {{region of}} the state indicate that the oldest civilization to appear {{in what is now}} modern Chiapas is that of the Mokaya, which were cultivating corn and living in houses as early as 1500 BCE, making them <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the oldest in Mesoamerica. There is speculation that these were the forefathers of the Olmec, migrating across the Grijalva Valley and onto the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico to the north, which was Olmec territory. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people's</b> ancient cities is now the archeological site of Chiapa de Corzo, in which was found the oldest calendar known on a piece of ceramic with a date of 36 BCE.
