5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E

England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} the logic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy,</b> arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices {{and lead to}} an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also {{lead to an increase}} in poaching.|$|E

At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J.

One part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen.

40|$|AbstractSeveral factors {{within the}} food {{environment}} may stimulate overconsumption.

After the literature was screened for evidence of factors that contribute to <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> large amounts of food, 32 behavioural strategies were identified to overcome these influences (study 1). Subjectively reported feasibility and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 32 behavioural <b>strategies</b> in weight management were explored using a pretest post-test study (study 2 : n= 52). Additionally, two cross-sectional questionnaire studies (study 3 a: n= 120 and study 3 b: n= 278) were conducted to evaluate the association between <b>the</b> 32 behavioural <b>strategies</b> and BMI. <b>The</b> <b>strategies</b> were subjectively reported as feasible and useful in weight management. Frequent use of strategies discriminated non-overweight from overweight individuals, but did not discriminate overweight from obese individuals. In conclusion, the findings provided preliminary evidence for the acceptability and validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> for controlling <b>the</b> amount consumed should be further investigated, especially in overweight and obese participants...|$|R
