5|$|The Lothian 'Ridacard' bus pass is a {{pre-paid}} plastic smartcard giving unlimited {{travel on}} regular daytime and night bus services, {{as well as}} Edinburgh Trams services. It is purchased initially from a Transport for Edinburgh Travelshop, where the owner's picture is incorporated on the card to prevent misuse. Once purchased, the card can be placed onto an <b>on-board</b> <b>reader,</b> which reads the contactless chip in the smartcard. Cards can be credited for a weekly, 4 weekly or annual period. A warning is displayed on the last five days of validity. The card can then be topped up at Transport for Edinburgh Travelshops or Pay Point equipped retailers.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to install and run Windows Vista or Windows 7 on the earlier model laptop. In high-end versions appearing during 2009, Windows Vista is pre-installed. The lack of a DVD-ROM drive requires creating a bootable USB flash drive (the <b>on-board</b> card <b>reader</b> slots are not bootable) using a USB external DVD drive or PXE boot network install.|$|R
50|$|After {{an early}} {{prototype}} {{based on a}} custom x86 core, supporting PS/2 keyboard and mouse, the platform was redesigned around an NSC Geode SC2200 supporting only USB peripherals. An optional <b>on-board</b> SmartCard <b>reader</b> attached to an internally mounted USB port made the original ThinCan an instant hit on the local market, due to an Estonian legislation dating from 2001 that mandated the issuance of a national Electronic ID card to all citizens and their use to access many public services.|$|R
5000|$|A Nintendo DS port of {{the game}} subtitled Card Battle War (KƒÅdo Batoru Taisen) was {{released}} on July 29, 2010, featuring a modified game system {{as there is no}} <b>on-board</b> card <b>reader</b> for the handheld. The player controls a fan of the Ganbaride game who has to use his or her ability at the game to work for the DOLL paranormal research group who have discovered a weird bug in the game system. Meanwhile, an evil organization called [...] "Bug" [...] has come forward to use this dangerous game mechanic to their advantage.|$|R
40|$|Many {{automobile}} {{drivers are}} aware of the driving behaviours and habits that can lead to inefficient and unsafe driving. However, it is often the case that these same drivers unknowingly exhibit these inefficient and unsafe driving behaviors in their everyday driving activity. This paper proposes a practical and economical way to capture, measure, and alert drives of inefficient and unsafe driving. The proposed solution consists of a mobile application, running on a modern smartphone device, paired with a compatible OBD-II (<b>On-board</b> diagnostics II) <b>reader...</b>|$|R
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{from the}} transport section, {{in many developing}} countries, has not been dealt with the same intensity than that of developed countries. Due to the rapidly expanding mobile populations in the developing world, the issue of low carbon development and transport needs to be urgently addressed. In this paper, two cars using different routes have been employed. Vehicle speed and engine speed along with other data have been extracted from the two cars using an <b>on-board</b> diagnostic <b>reader</b> and a data acquisition software installed in a portable PC. Data has been saved and used to establish driving cycles for Aleppo city in SYRIA and to estimate the energy consumption of the two cars. A representative driving cycle reflecting the real-world driving conditions is proposed and estimated vehicle emissions is compared with measured results. The method is easy to follow and the results correlate well with the estimated values. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{my parents}} This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} radio-frequency identification (RFID) for three funda-mental tasks in mobile robotics: mapping, self-localization, and trajectory estimation. These topics have widely been studied in recent years, because they are regarded as key ingredients to autonomous robots. In particular, we investigate the application of long-range passive RFID in the work at hand. This RFID standard is expected {{to play a major}} role in the automation of identification processes in industry and commerce. We make several contributions to the examined tasks and show their effectiveness in extensive ex-periments with real robots. One central guideline of our approaches is that they use only the given inexpensive transponder infrastructure as well as off-the-shelf RFID hardware. An important field of application of passive transponder mapping is the continuous in-ventory of RFID-tagged goods: Compared to classical inventory, objects can be located rather than only enregistered. For this purpose, the robot traverses the environment and continuously detects transponders, using its <b>on-board</b> RFID <b>reader.</b> Localizing the RFI...|$|R

However it is often the case that these same drivers unknowingly manifest these inefficient and unsafe driving behaviours in their everyday driving activity. The proposed system proposes a practical and economical way to capture measure and alert drives of inefficient and unsafe driving as well as highly efficient system aimed at early detection and alert of dangerous vehicle maneuvers typically related to drunk driving.

This can be realised by embedding intelligence at the product and operational level to provide predictive, risk preventative and high performing manufacturing systems. The work outlined in this paper details how a Returnable Transit Item (RTI) can {{become an integral part}} of the Industrie 4. 0 vision as an intelligent container that can interact with components, machines and other manufacturing services...|$|R
