5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four {{were placed in the}} sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull,</b> two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E

5|$|An {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> {{showed that}} a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off.

5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink.

5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and the orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed {{new light on the}} construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
50|$|To {{compensate}} for the missing daggerboards, <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> profiles are narrow and deep, and forma keel, similar to the Dart 18 and other beach catamarans.
