40|$|General {{equilibrium}} analyses <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> {{costs have}} had mixed messages on {{the implications for}} employment. This paper brings out the economic forces at work and explains the disparate results. Specifically, we show that positive employment effects <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> costs come through reducing labor reallocation, whereas negative effects come through reducing the private return to work due to those layoff costs and the associated inefficient allocation of labor. Additional adverse employment effects can arise through {{an increase in the}} effective bargaining strength of workers. These forces explain why layoff costs tend to increase employment in search models while the opposite is true in models with employment lotteries. In matching models, we show that the employment effects depend critically on how layoff costs are assumed to enter the bargaining process...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{downsizing}} is a prevalent, cost-reduction {{corporate strategy}} that executives often use {{to deal with}} dynamic competitive environments. Several {{studies have examined the}} financial implications of downsizing by evaluating the relationship between downsizing strategies and organizational performance and/or profitability. Other researchers have focused upon the responses and behaviors <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> victims, survivors, and managers as a result of downsizing. Relatively few studies however, have investigated the impacts <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> characteristics on the cognitions of the managers who plan and implement organizational downsizing. It has been argued that the process <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> implementation potentially generates dissonance for the layoff agents {{as a result of the}} requirement to perform actions that are inconsistent with their cognitions and beliefs concerning workplace norms and behaviors (Margolis 2 ̆ 6 Molinsky, 2008; Parker 2 ̆ 6 McKinley, 2008; Sronce 2 ̆ 6 McKinley, 2006). This study builds upon Festinger 2 ̆ 7 s (1957) cognitive dissonance theory that individuals experiencing cognitive dissonance have motivation to adopt dissonance reduction strategies, such as changing their behaviors or their cognitions, in order to balance the conflict between their beliefs in managerial role and actions <b>of</b> implementing <b>layoffs.</b> Four hypotheses are proposed to compare responses among participants facing different layoff characteristics. More specifically, drawing upon the free-choice paradigm (Brehm, 1956) of cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), I anticipate that the subjects who make a more difficult layoff decision under certain layoff circumstances will experience more cognitive dissonance and will be motivated to adopt more positive perceptions of downsizing as a dissonance-reduction method than those who make an easier layoff decision. To evaluate the above relationships, a two-by-two factorial between-subjects experiment with various layoff conditions was carried out to investigate the impacts <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> attributes on layoff agency-induced cognitive dissonance and layoff agents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of downsizing. Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) methods were performed with gender and family layoff victimhood as control variables. The analyses found supports for hypothesis 1 and 3. Namely, individuals who make more difficult layoff decisions tend to experience more cognitive dissonance. The results of this study draw attention to how different layoff attributes affect layoff agents 2 ̆ 7 responses especially in terms of their cognitions...|$|R

40|$|This paper expands on Gibbons and Katz (1991) {{by looking}} at how the {{difference}} in wage losses across plant closing and layoff varies with race and gender. We find that the differences between white males and the other groups are striking and complex. The lemons effect <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> holds for white males as in Gibbons and Katz model, {{but not for the}} other three demographic groups (white females, black females, and black males). These three all experience a greater decline in earnings at plant closings than at layoffs. This results from two reinforcing effects. First, plant closings have substantially more negative effects on minorities than on whites. Second, layoffs seem to have more negative consequences for white men than the other groups. We also find that the relative wage losses <b>of</b> blacks following <b>layoffs</b> increased after the Civil Rights Act of 1991 which we take as suggestive of an informational effect <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> as in Gibbons and Katz. The results are suggestive that the large losses that African Americans experience at plant closing could result from heterogeneity in taste discrimination across firms. ...|$|R

25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to the {{corporate}} culture. While ND previously had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round <b>of</b> <b>layoffs</b> was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to call back to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E
40|$|Many kindergartens {{have been}} {{affected}} by declining birthrates, and it has become difficult for them to recruit students. Due to the consideration of costs and benefits, some have had to lay off teachers to maintain operational benefits. This study focused on the types <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> decisions made by kindergarten operators, as well as which types <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> decisions would better benefit kindergarten competitiveness and effectiveness. Using the decision model by Husted and Allen (2008) as the foundation, this study divided layoff decisions into the ability approach, the public good approach, and the care approach, as well as in-group favoritism decisions, based on a literature review. On one hand, it analyzed the differences between various types of kindergartens in making layoff decisions, {{and on the other hand}} it explored the effect <b>of</b> different <b>layoff</b> decisions on kindergarten competitiveness and effectiveness. This study extracted 205 managers of kindergartens from the 23 cities and counties of Taiwan for questionnaire surveys. The research results showed that the <b>layoff</b> decisions <b>of</b> kindergarten principals in Taiwan were generally inclined toward the ability approach and public good decisions, while in-group favoritism decisions were less often used. Different types of kindergartens also showed differences in terms <b>of</b> <b>layoff</b> decisions; in-group favoritism decision was used more often in privately operated kindergartens than in religious/charitable kindergartens. In addition, kindergartens established by religious/charitable organizations were more likely to use care approach decisions, while kindergartens affiliated with schools were more likely to use ability approach decisions; however, the post-hoc comparisons were not significant. In addition, in-group favoritism decisions also had a negative effect on the kindergarten competitiveness and management effectiveness, but ability approach decisions had a positive effect on both of them. Care approach decisions could benefit management effectiveness but they had no significant effect on elevating competitiveness. </p...|$|R

Second, when opening to international trade, the elasticity of demand perceived by an industry increases.
