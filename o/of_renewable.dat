30|$|The fuzzy {{parameters}} of VPP scheduling strategy {{come from the}} unpredictable output <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> in VPPs [24]. Accurate mathematical expressions of those uncertain characteristics should be established, which are the foundations for the uncertain scheduling strategy. The main characterizing methods include modeling output <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> and modeling their predicted errors. In this paper, the modeling of the forecast errors is considered to describe the fuzziness <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> instead <b>of</b> modeling the output. The modeling <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> output will make three constraints containing fuzzy variables, which are the supply–demand balance constraint, the spinning reserve constraint, and the static security constraint. If the predicted value {{is regarded as a}} deterministic value and the prediction error is utilized to describe the fuzziness <b>of</b> <b>renewables,</b> only the spinning reserve constraint should be considered.|$|R

5|$|While most of {{the large}} {{hydropower}} plants in Russia date from the Soviet era, the abundance of fossil fuels in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation has resulted in little need {{for the development of}} other renewable energy sources. There are currently plans to develop all types <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of Russia's energy output, and has taken steps to promote the development <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{government}} policy support, {{which includes the}} lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> energy technologies {{and the presence of}} policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development.

40|$|Shares <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> in European {{electricity}} markets are increasing based on different support policies. The paper discusses {{to what degree}} the design of these policies and their implementation on a European level impacts the type and quantity <b>of</b> effects that <b>renewables</b> have on {{electricity markets}}. Contrary to initial expectations simulations show that the (theoretically more market-oriented) quota scheme does not necessarily have less impact on market prices than a feed-in tariff or a feed-in premium. The most important driver for all effects is however unsurprisingly the overall share <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> in the electricity mix. The effects can be substantially mitigated by expanding the European grid infrastructure: higher interconnector capacities allow for a less volatile market environment. The influence of the support scheme on the bidding behaviour <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> was however not {{taken into account in}} the analysis...|$|R

5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E

40|$|The central {{obstacle}} for {{a widespread}} use <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> are the relative prices of {{these forms of}} energy not their availability.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{empirical}} and theoretical background to high shares <b>of</b> <b>renewables</b> in the electricity system. First we examine {{what is meant by}} "high shares" of renewables; next we consider what we mean by electricity "markets"; then we discuss what the term "cope with" implies; before returning to the suitability of "current" electricity markets. Second, we turn to three examples of jurisdictions - Germany, the UK and the State of New York in the US - with specific aspirations for decarbonisation and the role <b>of</b> <b>renewables.</b> Each exhibits very different approaches to the way they are adjusting their electricity market design to cope with high shares <b>of</b> <b>renewables.</b> We suggest that a new wave of electricity experiments is beginning around the theme of how to incorporate large shares <b>of</b> intermittent <b>renewable</b> generation in to electricity systems.

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} the second most used form <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> energy in Russia but {{represents}} less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
