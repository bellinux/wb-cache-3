The distribution of the bacteria species in the gut depends on their need of and aversion to <b>oxygen,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> and substrate abundance, with variability based on age, gender and other pathogens present in the mice.ASF 360 and ASF 361 are Lactobacilli. Lactobacilli are filamentous, Gram-positive, aerotolerant bacteria, and common colonizers of the GI mucosa and squamous epithelia of mice. ASF 360 was thought to be L. acidophilus. However, 16SrRNA results showed that it is closely related to but distinct from L. acidophilus. ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus species; clustered with L. acidophilus and L. lactis. ASF 361 has nearly identical 16S rRNA sequences to L. murinus and L. animalis. Both species are routinely found in GI tracts of mice and rats. A thorough examination of the two species and strains is necessary to determine the identity of ASF 361 with more confidence. ASF 361 is completely distinct from the L. salivarius that it was believed to be. ASF 360 and ASF 361 colonize in high numbers in the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, and the cecum due to their aerotolerance.|$|E

In this report we describe {{nasotracheal intubation}} performed in 38 male New Zealand White rabbits (3. 0 to 5. 5 kg) used for a vascular patch study. The rabbits were placed under general anesthesia twice, with 2 mo between the initial and final intubations. Rabbits were intubated by the oral or nasotracheal route and compared. Previous literature dismissed nasotracheal intubation, citing the possibility of introducing pathogens into the lungs {{and the necessity of}} high <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> (presumably greater than 3 L/min).

Total relaxation was essential, modification of the classic blind approach eased placement, a correct approach was necessary, and our development of a unique method of securing the tube improved tube management.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to gain a {{fundamental}} understanding {{of the influence of}} bias voltage and <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on the resulting microstructure and crystallographic properties of gas flow sputtered (GFS) yttria stabilized zirconia coatings. At given substrate temperature of 500 °C fully yttria stabilized zirconia (FYSZ) coatings (10 - 30 μm) were deposited on a FeCrAl-alloy. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the substrate bias voltage were varied over a wide range. The resulting microstructures were columnar, but varied widely in porosity and column diameter. While increased <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> generally results in coarser microstructures with higher porosity, bias voltage seems to increase the effective surface temperature due to ion bombardment at low voltage, but has a destructive effect at higher voltages leading to randomized grain orientations and small grain sizes. Thermal cycling experiments were conducted between 100 °C and 1050 °C. Although no large scale spallation was observed, the former columnar coating degraded due to sintering, resulting in sinter necks between former single columns and diminished intra-columnar porosity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{table of}} the {{approximate}} ranges of inspired oxygen delivered at given <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> is often given on the packaging of oxygen masks. A study was carried out to check the inspired oxygen concentration given {{by one of the}} new masks, which has been designed to be used with or without the Venturi attachment {{as a result of the}} proposal to use it without the Venturi attachment as a general purpose mask for emergency use. METHODS: Measurements were made at resting respiratory rate and 26 breaths/min in 12 normal subjects. Continuous oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were recorded at the lips with a mass spectrometer, and inspired oxygen concentrations were calculated from end tidal values by means of the alveolar gas equation. Measurements were made at <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 2, 4, and 6 l/min for the mask alone and at 2 and 4 l/min with both the 24 % and the 28 % Venturi attachments. RESULTS: Without the Venturi attachment the mask gave average inspired oxygen concentrations 8 - 10 % greater than are stated on the packaging at <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 2, 4, and 6 l/min at resting respiratory rates of 8 - 20 breaths/min, some individuals receiving 30 % more than expected. Addition of the interchangeable Venturi attachments designed to give 24 % and 28 % inspired oxygen delivered average concentrations within 2 % of the expected concentrations, no individual receiving more than 5 % above the expected concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The labelling on the packaging of oxygen masks may lead to inappropriate use by those not expert in prescribing oxygen therapy. Caution is still needed when a single multipurpose mask is being selected for emergency use, where accurate delivery of low concentrations of oxygen is vital for some patients...|$|R

40|$|Reactive {{magnetron}} sputtering enables the deposition of various thin films {{to be used}} for protective as well as optical and electronic applications. However, progressing target erosion during sputtering results in increased magnetic field strengths at the target surface. Consequently, the glow discharge, the target poisoning, and hence the morphology, crystal structure and stoichiometry of the prepared thin films are influenced. Therefore, these effects were investigated by varying the cathode current Im between 0. 50 and 1. 00 A, the magnetic field strength B between 45 and 90 mT, and the O 2 /(Ar+O 2) <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> ratio between 0 and 100 %. With increasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> ratio a sub-stoichiometric TaOx oxide forms at the metallic Ta target surface which further transfers to a non-conductive tantalum pentoxide Ta 2 O 5, impeding a stable DC glow discharge. These two transition zones (from Ta to TaOx and from TaOx to Ta 2 O 5) shift to higher <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> for increasing target currents. Contrary, increasing the magnetic field strength (e. g., due to sputter erosion) mainly shifts the TaOx to Ta 2 O 5 transition to lower <b>oxygen</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> while marginally influencing the Ta to TaOx transition. To allow for a stable DC glow discharge (and to suppress the formation of non-conductive Ta 2 O 5 at the target) even at a <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> ratio of 100 % either a high target current (Im >= 1 A) or a low magnetic field strength (B <= 60 mT) is necessary. These conditions are required to prepare stoichiometric and fully crystalline Ta 2 O 5 films.
