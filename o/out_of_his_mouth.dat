5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the bit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> causing the bridle to drop to his chest, {{but he kept}} running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{with a pair of}} forceps, {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} a panel of outside experts determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his Inspiration closed circuit rebreather (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's inattention to his handset and head up displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to Aquarius alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from hypoxia and drowned when the mouthpiece came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Saturation and CCR diving at Aquarius were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures.|$|E

25|$|On May 5, 2009, Smith was {{assisting}} two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, {{who were}} 300 feet from Aquarius using an underwater jackhammer {{to install a}} way station that would contain breathable air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to Aquarius but would be back. Five or ten minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Seymour began carrying Smith back to Aquarius, but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith {{the rest of the}} distance to Aquarius, where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the Aquarius program.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} a Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship. Último Dragón and Shannon Moore started the match with Dragón getting a pinfall victory after the Dragon-DDT, but was then forced to submit by Jamie Noble with the Dragon Sleeper, who next {{eliminated}} Funaki in 8 seconds. Nunzio was {{then in the}} match, but was eliminated after being counted out of the match when {{he was unable to}} return to the ring by the referee's count of ten. Billy Kidman then entered the match, pinning and eliminating Noble following a top rope BK-Bomb. Kidman was then pinned and eliminated by Rey Mysterio with a Modified Powerbomb from the top rope. Tajiri was the next entrant, but was also pinned by Mysterio following a standing West Coast Pop. Akio was the next scheduled entrant but was unable to compete due to being inadvertently attacked by Tajiri with his signature green mist he spat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> when Mysterio ducked. The Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero, was the final entrant and pinned Mysterio with a reversal of Mysterio's Sunset Flip to win with the assistance of his father Chavo Classic, thus retaining the title.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{the barrio}} Capaya {{completely}} deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and {{the whereabouts of}} the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers were talking about. Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the episode}} {{took place in}} August 2007. The opening and closing outdoor scenes were filmed in Trefil Quarry in the Brecon Beacons, the {{external}} scenes of the complex at Aberthaw Cement Works, and scenes in the [...] "battery farm" [...] were filmed in a hangar at RAF Saint Athan. CGI was used sparingly in production; the snow was paper snow adhered by water, and the Ood heads contained complex animatronics. McInnerny wore a prosthetic mask with two layers for his transformation scene though the production team's best boy provided motion capture for the computer-generated profile of the appendages coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> when this needed to be refilmed and McInnerny was unavailable.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{was told}} that he would be a series regular in season 3 the {{previous}} February, only a few days after his wedding. Muhney was very pleased to be a series regular, comparing his status to becoming a family member in the show rather than [...] "someone who comes over for dinner occasionally." [...] Piz (Chris Lowell) was named after the director of the show's pilot episode, Mark Piznarski. He was created in order to give Veronica a male friend who was not upper class. Thomas called Piz a [...] "Lloyd Dobler mold" [...] and [...] "a middle-class kid from a Portland suburb who has too many words coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Gielgud was {{uninterested in}} {{religion}} or politics. As a boy {{he had been}} fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner {{not long after the}} Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, [...] "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as he was talking to the prime minister, Clement Attlee, the answer was [...] "10 Downing Street". In his Who's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud's personality was [...] "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, [...] "the words tumbling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself." ...|$|E

Henery Walker began to talk about Australey then, and asked 'im 'ow many sheep he'd got, and the words was 'ardly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>mouth</b> afore the old gentleman stood up and said he was arter his money ag'in.|$|R

500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his [...] concert, {{wrote about}} him, [...] "Roy Orbison {{was like an}} opera singer.

2500|$|Major teachings in {{this period}} include the Discourse on Defilement in Matthew 15:1–20 and Mark 7:1–23 where in {{response}} to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: [...] "What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> that is what makes him 'unclean.'".|$|E

2500|$|Series 5 saw {{the picture}} frame being used {{less than in}} {{previous}} series and in addition, there were attempts to implement numerous tricks with the picture frame, including firing gunge and pushing out small objects like bouquets of flowers. e.g. when Huw Edwards was in the picture frame he said [...] "News just in, this just out" [...] before the person operating the mouth hosed gunge <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
2500|$|John's {{vision of}} the Son of Man is {{described}} in the scriptural Revelation [...] John sees a {{vision of the}} risen, ascended and glorified Jesus Christ, whom he describes as one [...] "like the Son of Man" [...] (verse 12). Jesus is portrayed in this vision as having a robe with a golden sash, white hair, eyes like blazing fire, feet like bronze and a voice like rushing waters. He holds seven stars in his right hand and has a double-edged sword coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> The vision is also notable for being the only identifiable physical description of Jesus in any form in the Biblical canon.|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton usually wore a {{cape and}} a {{crumpled}} hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar hanging <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He {{had a tendency}} to forget where {{he was supposed to be}} going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there.
