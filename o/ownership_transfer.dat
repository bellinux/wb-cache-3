5|$|The Roseland Theater, {{sometimes}} called the Roseland Theater and Grill, is a music venue located at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The building was originally a church, constructed by the Apostolic Faith Church in 1922. In 1982, Larry Hurwitz converted the building to a music venue called Starry Night.

Hurwitz sold the club in 1991, claiming he had lost support from the local music industry.

O'Malley forbade the {{speaking}} of Rickey's name in Dodgers offices with transgressors {{being subjected to}} a fine. He abolished Rickey's title of General Manager so that no front office person could perpetuate Rickey's role. In addition, when Rickey assumed the title with the Pittsburgh Pirates, O'Malley arranged for the Dodgers to omit the Pirates from their spring training schedule. Nonetheless, after the transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O'Malley: they won the National League pennants in , , [...] -- the year of their first World Series championship -- and [...] Under O'Malley, the Dodgers were the most overtly political post World War II franchise. In 1951, Brooklyn native and United States Congressman Emanuel Celler's Judiciary Committee investigated whether the reserve clause was in violation of federal anti-trust laws. Celler represented half of Brooklyn in Congress and O'Malley used the local press such as the Brooklyn Eagle to pressure Celler into backing off of the issue. During the 1951 season, the Dodgers engaged former West Point varsity baseball player and U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur to lure war veterans. [...] O'Malley attempted to entice {{him to take the}} post of Commissioner of Baseball.

40|$|A key {{question}} for organizational learning {{research is to}} identify opportunities and constraints for firms to gain useful information from the activities and performance of other firms. We argue that vicarious information contained in outlet-level <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> of other firms presents an important opportunity for small multi-unit organizations to gain marketplace information, which they can use to reduce the likelihood that their outlets in other markets will fail. Further, we hypothesize that the geographical distance between the multi-unit owner’s headquarters and a focal outlet erodes the survival benefits of the vicarious information. We find that {{the likelihood of a}} multi-unit owner’s outlet failure declines when there are many <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> in other markets where the owner has other outlets. We also find that the presence of <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> in the multi-unit owner’s other markets decreases the failure rate of the owner’s outlet less if the owner’s headquarters are distant from a given outlet. The results suggest that <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> generate vicarious information substantial enough to reduce failure rates among outlets of multiunit organizations, especially for outlets that are closer to an owner’s headquarters [...] Recent research in organizational theory and economics has explored the nature, sources...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1990 s, {{approximately}} half of all commercial U. S. nuclear power reactors were sold by price-regulated public utilities to independent power producers. At {{the time of the}} <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers,</b> some policy makers raised concerns that these profit-maximizing corporations would ignore safety. Others claimed that corporations would improve reactor management, with positive effects on safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive evidence of the effect of these <b>ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> on plant safety. Using data on a variety of safety measures and a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, I find no evidence that safety deteriorated; for some measures, it even improved following divestiture. Moreover, for given levels of generation, safety substantially improved. <b>Ownership</b> <b>transfers</b> led to increased operating efficiency, and these gains do not appear to have come at the cost of public safety. To provide intuition for these findings, I show how these results are consistent with the incentives faced by nuclear plant operators. Key words: nuclear safety, nuclear power, deregulatio...|$|R
