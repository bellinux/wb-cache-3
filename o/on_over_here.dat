40|$|It {{was a hot}} North Carolina July {{morning and}} Susan and her friends were headed to the beach. Everyone had the day off from work and it seemed a {{wonderful}} opportunity to cool down {{and have a good}} time. Susan figured she could get to the beach in two hours from her house in Rocky Mount. After putting on her swimsuit and grabbing her sunscreen, she got into the car. Twenty minutes later she had picked up Kathy and Linda and they were off to the coast! After driving over a bridge that crossed the Pamlico Estuary, a strong odor began to permeate the car. Kathy covered her nose with her hand. Linda, who hadn’t eaten breakfast, felt her stomach turn over and thought to herself that the day was going to be spoiled. Susan, however, was curious and suggested they explore. “What do you think that smell is, anyway? ” she said as she pulled the car over and jumped out, leaving her friends no choice but to follow her. As they got closer to the estuary, the source of the odor became clear when they saw hundreds of dead fish floating on the water and washed up on the beach. When Kathy caught up to Susan and Linda, she gasped, “I’ve never seen such a sight—how horrible!” A group of people were gathered on the shore. Some were pulling dead fish out of the estuary while others were sampling the water using various pieces of equipment. The three women walked over and learned that the group was made up of volunteers who were working to clean up the area as well as several biologists gathering data. Kathy, Susan, and Linda offered to help. Susan was working with one of the biologists, Dr. Edwin Trout, and his graduate student from the local university. She liked Dr. Trout. He appeared focused on his work, but was friendly at the same time. His graduate student, Mark Cooper, was also nice and seemed very passionate about collecting data. Susan directed her questions to him: “What caused this fish kill? Was it the heat? It seems to be affecting a lot of animals these days. ” “Well, the high temperatures are often related to low oxygen levels in the water, ” Mark replied. “Come <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>here.</b> I’ll show you some data maps we have been collecting from the Neuse River. ” Mark showed Susan a series of dissolved oxygen map...|$|E
