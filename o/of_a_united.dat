5|$|Deady {{originally}} was {{to travel with}} a government designated Indian agent and the agent's family. At Fort Leavenworth the agent remained, and Deady continued his journey in the company <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>United</b> States Army regiment bound for Fort Vancouver. Taking the Oregon Trail, he arrived where Portland, Oregon, now stands on November 14, 1849. The next day he went to neighboring Oregon City, {{and then a few}} days later west to Lafayette, Oregon. At that city, the county seat of Yamhill County at that time, the red-haired Deady began teaching as his occupation to make ends meet. He first worked for room and board, but for the second term of the school year he was paid $75 per month.|$|E

Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E

Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{had long}} {{intended}} to architecturally reconstruct the German capital Berlin {{into a new}} imperial metropolis, which he decided in 1942 to rename Germania upon its scheduled completion in 1950.

5|$|In Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the Picts in the north east, the Britons in the south, including the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and the Gaels or Scotti (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of Dál Riata in the west. Kenneth MacAlpin is traditionally viewed as the first king <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>united</b> Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or Alba to the Scots). The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.|$|E
5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>united,</b> multiracial Parliament. In fact, minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E

According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E

Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{together}} with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh's half-sister, Melisende of Lusignan, in Tripoli. During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli.|$|E

5|$|On June1, Klotzbach's team issued their updated {{forecast}} for the 2012season, predicting thirteen named storms and five hurricanes, of which {{two of those}} five would further intensify into major hurricanes. The university stated {{that there was a}} high amount of uncertainty concerning whether or not an El Niño would develop in time to hinder tropical development in the Atlantic basin. They also stated there was a lower than average chance of a major hurricane impacting the United States coastline in 2012. On June6, Tropical Storm Risk released their second {{updated forecast}} for the season, predicting fourteen named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. In addition, the agency called for an Accumulated Cyclone Energy index of 100. Near-average sea surface temperatures and slightly elevated trade winds for cited for lower activity compared to the 2010 and 2011hurricane seasons. Tropical Storm Risk continued with their forecast of a near-average probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>United</b> States impact during the season using the 1950–2011 long-term normal, but a slightly below-average chance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>United</b> States landfall by the recent 2002–2011 normal.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church at {{the time}} faced {{difficulty}} retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing social ostracism. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the problem on the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>united</b> Catholic identity, or sensus Catholicus, as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
