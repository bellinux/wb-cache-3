5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} wanted {{a return to}} the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett consult Chuck Burks, an {{old friend}} of Fox Mulder's, who tells the two that Siddhi mystics could do the things Scully described; the mystics have powers of the mind and can alter people’s {{perceptions}} of reality. Scully theorizes that a mystic is acting out <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> since an American plant inadvertently released a gas cloud that killed 118 people in Vishi, outside of Mumbai. One of the victims was the 11-year-old son of a holy man of the beggar caste.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Philomela, Procne and Tereus is largely {{influenced}} by the lost tragedy Tereus of Sophocles. Scholar Jenny Marsh claims that Sophocles borrowed certain plot elements from Euripides drama Medea—notably a wife killing her child in an act <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> against her husband—and incorporated them in his tragedy Tereus. She implies that the infanticide of Itys did {{not appear in the}} Tereus myth until Sophocles' play and that it was introduced because of what was borrowed from Euripides.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions were made at the military level.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no cruelty to wounded or to prisoners; no {{poisoned}} arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> seemed to animate them: they fought us in fair conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy worthy of a more enlightened people.|$|E
5|$|A distant kinsman of the assassin, Henry Bellingham, became Conservative MP for North West Norfolk in 1983, {{and held}} junior {{office in the}} Cameron–Clegg {{coalition}} of 2010–15. When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997—he regained it in 2001—his narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the Referendum Party whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives. Despite the different spelling, media accounts asserted Percival's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister's family, and reported the defeat as a belated form <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b>|$|E
