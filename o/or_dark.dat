5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|Boys may wear a dark grey {{or black}} suit, plain black, grey or navy V-neck sweater and a scarf of a plain colour. Girls may wear plain {{tailored}} suits (skirt or trousers) in black, navy <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> grey. Shirts may be plain grey, blue or white. There is a sixth form house tie available, although girls {{may choose to}} wear a pin badge instead.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E

5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> brown in age.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator. With former titles like Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said {{the story was}} grim <b>or</b> <b>dark.</b> However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era of silent cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions.|$|E

50|$|The {{high-speed}} {{test for}} rejecting non-corner points is operated by examining 4 example pixels, namely pixel 1, 9, 5 and 13. Because {{there should be}} at least 12 contiguous pixels that are whether all brighter <b>or</b> <b>darker</b> than the candidate corner, so there {{should be at least}} 3 pixels out of these 4 example pixels that are all brighter <b>or</b> <b>darker</b> than the candidate corner. Firstly pixels 1 and 9 are examined, if both I1 and I9 are within - t, Ip, then candidate p is not a corner. Otherwise pixels 5 and 13 are further examined to check whether three of them are brighter than Ip + t <b>or</b> <b>darker</b> than Ip - t. If there exists 3 of them that are either brighter <b>or</b> <b>darker,</b> the rest pixels are then examined for final conclusion. And according to the inventor in his first paper, on average 3.8 pixels are needed to check for candidate corner pixel. Compared with 8.5 pixels for each candidate corner, 3.8 is really a great reduction which could highly improve the performance.|$|R

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> gray in females. Monk seals {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E

5|$|Separate {{from the}} main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five {{attributes}} (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero <b>or</b> <b>Dark</b> it assumes that form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E
5|$|The Yunnan hare (Lepus comus) is a {{medium-sized}} species of mammal {{in the family}} Leporidae. It has soft, flat, and long dorsal pelage which is grayish brown <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> gray in color, and whitish ventral pelage. It was considered endemic to China (mainly in Yunnan), but its presence was recorded in northern Myanmar in 2000. It is an herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listof Endangered Species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, almost meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> {{brown in}} color and {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E

5000|$|In {{computer}} graphics, {{the process}} of {{improving the quality of}} a digitally stored image by manipulating the image with software. It is quite easy, for example, to make an image lighter <b>or</b> <b>darker,</b> <b>or</b> to increase or decrease contrast. Advanced photo enhancement software also supports many filters for altering images in various ways. Programs specialized for image enhancement are sometimes called image editors.|$|R
5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the greying gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but displays variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the nestling develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its wing coverts and the featherless skin on the head is black <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not carmine, on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch {{on the back of}} the head being golden yellow instead of carmine and the tail being only a third as long as that of an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{placement}} of P.auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial. It {{has often been}} classified in the section Auricomi, a grouping of species characterized {{by the absence of}} a veil, and the occasional presence of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface), <b>or</b> <b>dark</b> setae-like elements. Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade, but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling. A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola, P.auricoma and P.conopilus form a tritomy with the crown Parasola species.|$|E
25|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies Orthalicus reses reses {{is distinguished}} from the supposed subspecies Orthalicus reses nesodryas by the lighter color pattern of the apical whorl, columella, and parietal callus.
