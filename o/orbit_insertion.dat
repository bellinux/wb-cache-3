5|$|In 2016, the Juno {{spacecraft}} imaged the Galilean moons {{from above}} their orbital plane as it approached Jupiter <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> creating a time-lapse movie of their motion.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Apollo 13, descent <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> {{was to be}} {{performed}} using the Service Module engine instead of the LM engine, {{in order to allow}} a greater fuel reserve for landing. This was actually done {{for the first time on}} Apollo 14, since the Apollo 13 mission was aborted before landing.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform Lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
40|$|Deep Space Network {{support is}} {{summarized}} {{for the two}} Viking missions to Mars and the Mars <b>orbit</b> <b>insertions</b> of Vikings 1 and 2 and the landing of Viking 1. Special procedures were employed during these critical events to minimize interruptions to the telemetry data return due to spacecraft data mode and attitude changes...|$|R
50|$|The main {{spacecraft}} design {{drivers are}} related to the large distance to the Sun, the use of solar power, and Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. The <b>orbit</b> <b>insertions</b> at Jupiter and Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25 gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) requires the spacecraft to carry about 3000 kg of chemical propellant.|$|R

Speakers include the Director of Solar System Exploration Division West Huntress, Magellan Project Manager Tony Spear, Spacecraft Team Chief W. Ledbetter, Radar System Chief Engineer T. Johnson, and Magellan Project Manager from Hughes Aircraft Co. T. McCarthy. The speakers discuss the Venus <b>Orbiting</b> <b>Insertion</b> (VOI), radar system components, spacecraft development, mission objectives, and the flight plans. This is tape 1 of 2; tape 2 has a report number NONP-NASA-VT- 2000036566...|$|R
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|Two smaller low-gain antennas {{are also}} present for lower-rate {{communication}} during emergencies and special events, such as launch and Mars <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion.</b> These antennas {{do not have}} focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2004, the Cassini–Huygens {{space probe}} {{performed}} the SOI (Saturn <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion)</b> maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended {{onto the surface}} of Titan on 14 January 2005, sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing. Cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of Titan and other icy satellites.|$|E
40|$|Since 2000, Boeing 702 {{satellites}} {{have used}} electric propulsion {{for transfer to}} geostationary orbits. The use of the 25 cm Xenon Ion Propulsion System (25 cm XIPS) results {{in more than a}} tenfold increase in specific impulse with the corresponding decrease in propellant mass needed to complete the mission when compared to chemical propulsion[1]. In addition to more favorable mass properties, with the use of XIPS, the 702 has been able to achieve <b>orbit</b> <b>insertions</b> with higher accuracy {{than it would have been}} possible with the use of chemical thrusters. This paper describes the experience attained by using the 702 XIPS ascent strategy to transfer satellite to geosynchronous orbits...|$|R
50|$|The Ariane 5 ME uses a new upper stage, with {{increased}} propellant volume, {{powered by the}} new Vinci engine. Unlike the HM-7B engine, it can restart several times, allowing for complex orbital maneuvers such as insertion of two satellites into different <b>orbits,</b> direct <b>insertion</b> into geosynchronous <b>orbit,</b> planetary exploration missions, and guaranteed upper stage deorbiting or <b>insertion</b> into graveyard <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Propulsion: A {{liquid fuel}} engine with a thrust of 440 newtons {{is used for}} <b>orbit</b> raising and <b>insertion</b> into Mars <b>orbit.</b> The orbiter also has eight 22-newton {{thrusters}} for attitude control. Its propellant mass at launch is [...]|$|R
5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} two forthcoming missions {{planned for the}} Jovian system. Juno, launched on 5 August 2011, has limited imaging capabilities, but it could monitor Io's volcanic activity using its near-infrared spectrometer, JIRAM. The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a planned European Space Agency mission to the Jovian system that is intended {{to end up in}} Ganymede orbit. JUICE has a launch scheduled for 2022, with arrival at Jupiter planned for January 2030. JUICE will not fly by Io, but it will use its instruments, such as a narrow-angle camera, to monitor Io's volcanic activity and measure its surface composition during the two-year Jupiter-tour phase of the mission prior to Ganymede <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) is a proposal for a Discovery-class mission that would launch in 2021. It would involve multiple flybys of Io while in orbit around Jupiter beginning in 2026.|$|E
25|$|Falcon9v1.1 {{continues}} {{to utilize the}} triple redundant flight computers and inertial navigation—with GPS overlay for additional <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> accuracy—that were originally used in the Falcon 9 v1.0.|$|E
50|$|The PEMBSIS {{experiment}} used hardware {{provided by}} the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan. As part of the NASDA Life Science Cell Culture Kit, this experiment used six petri-dish-like Plant Fixation Chambers (PFCs). The PFCs were used to hold the cultured plant cells for the PEMBSIS experiment. These containers are completely sealed. The PFCs allow plant cells exposed to space flight to be fixed in <b>orbit</b> by <b>insertion</b> of a chemical fixative via syringe through a septum port.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} on the fabrication and testing of a MicroElectro-Mechanical (MEM) microstrip series switch. This switch is being developed {{for use in a}} K-band phased array antenna that NASA will use for communication links in its Earth <b>orbiting</b> satellites. Preliminary <b>insertion</b> loss and isolation measurements are presented...|$|R
50|$|Kosmos 21 (Космос 21 meaning Cosmos 21) was a Soviet {{spacecraft}} with {{an unknown}} mission. This mission has been tentatively identified by NASA as a technology {{test of the}} Venera series space probes. It {{may have been an}} attempted Venus flyby, presumably similar to the later Kosmos 27 mission, or it may have been intended from the beginning to remain in geocentric orbit. In any case, the spacecraft never left Earth <b>orbit</b> after <b>insertion</b> by the SL-6/A-2-e launcher. The orbit decayed on November 14, three days after launch.|$|R
25|$|The {{plan was}} for an {{insertion}} into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, approximately 2 {{days after the}} arrival of NASA's MAVEN orbiter. The 440-newton liquid apogee motor was successfully test fired on 22 September at 09:00UTC for 3.968 seconds, about 41 hours before actual <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b>|$|E
25|$|MESSENGER made a flyby of Mercury on January 14, 2008 (making {{its closest}} {{approach}} of 200km {{above the surface}} of Mercury at 19:04:39 UTC), followed by a second flyby on October 6, 2008. MESSENGER executed a final flyby on September 29, 2009, further slowing down the spacecraft. Sometime during the closest approach of the last flyby, the spacecraft entered safe mode. Although this {{had no effect on}} the trajectory necessary for later <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> it resulted in the loss of science data and images that were planned for the outbound leg of the fly-by. The spacecraft had fully recovered by about seven hours later. One last deep space maneuver, DSM-5, was executed on November 24, 2009, at 22:45 UTC to provide the required velocity change for the scheduled Mercury <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> on March 18, 2011, marking the beginning of the orbital mission.|$|E
25|$|During {{the three-day}} trans-lunar coast, the four-man crew would monitor the Orion's systems, inspect their Altair {{spacecraft}} and its support equipment, and correct their flight path {{as necessary to}} allow the Altair to land at a near-polar landing site suitable for a future lunar base. Approaching the lunar far side, the Orion/Altair combination would orient the Altair's engines forward and make the lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI) burn.|$|E
50|$|Both SpaceX and Orbcomm were aware, {{prior to}} the mission, of the high risk that the {{secondary}} payload satellite could remain at the lower altitude of the Dragon <b>insertion</b> <b>orbit,</b> {{and that was a}} risk that Orbcomm agreed to take given the dramatically lower cost of launch for a secondary payload.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{secondary}} payload {{made it to}} the Dragon <b>insertion</b> <b>orbit,</b> an engine anomaly on one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage during the ascent resulted in automatic engine shutdown and a longer first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines to complete orbital insertion while subsequently increasing use of propellant over the nominal mission.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spaced using linear {{sequences}} of time-based commands. Linear sequences work fairly well, {{but they are}} difficult and expensive to generate, and are usually not capable of responding to contingencies. Any anomalous behavior while executing a linear sequence generally results in the spacecraft entering a safe mode. Critical sequences like <b>orbit</b> <b>insertions</b> which {{must be able to}} respond to faults without going into safe mode are particularly difficult to design and verify. The effort needed to generate command sequences can be reduced by extending the vocabulary of sequences to include more sophisticated control constructs. The simplest extensions are conditionals and loops. Adding these constructs would make a sequencing language look more or less like a traditional programming language or scripting language, and would come with all the difficulties associated with such a language. In particular, verifying the correctness of a sequence would be tantamount to verifying the correctness of a program, which is undecidable in general. We describe an extended vocabulary for non-linear sequencing based on the architectural notion of cognizant failure. A cognizant failure architecture is divided into components whose contract is to either achieve (or maintain) a certain condition, or report that they have failed to do so. Cognizant failure is an easier condition to verify than correctness, but it can provide high confidence in the safety of the spacecraft. Because cognizant failure inherently implies some kind of representation of the intent of an action, the system can respond to contingencies in more robust and general ways. We will describe an implemented non-linear sequencing system that is being flown on the NASA New Millennium Deep Space 1 Mission as part of the Remote Agent Experiment...|$|R
25|$|The Near Earth Commissioning phase {{extended}} from {{the separation of the}} spacecraft from the launcher upper stage until the completion of the initial check out of the orbiter and payload. It included the solar array deployment, the initial attitude acquisition, the declamping of the Beagle-2 spin-up mechanism, the injection error correction manoeuvre and the first commissioning of the spacecraft and payload (final commissioning of payload took place after Mars <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion).</b> The payload was checked out one instrument at a time. This phase lasted about one month.|$|E
25|$|The S-IVB-500 {{model used}} on the Saturn V {{differed}} from the S-IVB-200 used as {{the second stage of}} the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.|$|E
25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were {{to have the ability}} to {{throttle}} down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage was designed to be powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} Mars orbital phase of the Mariner 9 trajectory as determined from Earth based radio data. Both the method and accuracy of the orbit determination process are reviewed. Analysis is presented to show the effects of Mars gravity model and node in {{the plane of the}} sky errors on the accuracy of orbit determination. In addition the long term evolution of the <b>orbit</b> from <b>insertion</b> to date is presented, and is decomposed into effects from the Mars gravity field, n-body perturbations, and solar radiation pressure. Since the orbit period is nearly commensurable with the Mars rotational period, the orbit experiences significant resonance perturbations. The primary perturbation is in-track with a maximum amplitude of 1000 km and a wavelength of 39 revolutions...|$|R
50|$|To access {{circular}} orbits using {{a launch}} loop {{a relatively small}} 'kick motor' {{would need to be}} launched with the payload which would fire at apogee and would circularise the <b>orbit.</b> For GEO <b>insertion</b> this would need to provide a delta-v of about 1.6 km/s, for LEO to circularise at 500 km would require a delta-v of just 120 m/s. Conventional rockets require delta-vs of roughly 10 and 14 km/s to reach LEO and GEO respectively.|$|R
40|$|After giving brief {{development}} {{histories of}} the Delta and the Atlas Centaur launch vehicles, attention {{is given to the}} operational characteristics of the ascent, parking orbit, transfer <b>orbit,</b> and orbital <b>insertion</b> phases of the delivery of a communications satellite to a geostationary orbit by means of a Delta launch vehicle. NASA plans to employ Delta vehicles {{for as long as they}} are needed during the transition period to the Space Shuttle. NASA planning for Atlas Centaur includes launches through 1985 for INTELSAT-VA, and through 1986 for FLTSATCOM satellites...|$|R
25|$|Galileo {{arrived at}} Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after a six-year journey from Earth during which it used gravity assists with Venus and Earth to boost its orbit out to Jupiter. Shortly before Galileos Jupiter <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> maneuver, the {{spacecraft}} performed the only targeted flyby of Io of its nominal mission. High-resolution images were originally planned during the encounter, but {{problems with the}} spacecraft's tape recorder, used to save data taken during encounters for later playback to Earth, required the elimination of high-data-rate observations from the flyby schedule to ensure the safe recording of Galileo atmospheric probe data. The encounter did yield significant results from lower data rate experiments. Analysis of the Doppler shift of Galileos radio signal showed that Io is differentiated with a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System. Magnetometer data from the encounter, combined {{with the discovery of}} an iron core, suggested that Io might have a magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Japan's {{planetary}} missions have so {{far been}} limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis {{has been put on}} magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki (PLANET-C) and IKAROS solar sail demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle. On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit in 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the toposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.|$|E

50|$|On August 24, 2016, at 22:16:01 UTC, after {{a slight}} delay {{due to a}} rocket issue, the Ariane 5 ECA VA-232 flight {{launched}} from Guiana Space Center ELA-3, with Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36. At 22:44 UTC, Intelsat 33e separated from the rocket's upper stage. After 41 minutes of flight, both satellites had separated successfully. Intelsat confirmed that it had received the satellites signals as expected after separation. Arianespace estimated the <b>insertion</b> <b>orbit</b> as 248.7 km × 35,858 km × 5.98°, {{very close to the}} target of 249.0 km × 35,879 km × 6.00°.|$|R
40|$|The digital global {{feedback}} system (DGFB) was implemented to suppress orbit drift, low frequency beam motion, and <b>orbit</b> perturbed by <b>insertion</b> devices. Measured response matrix and singular value decomposition (SVD) [1, 2, 3] techniques were applied in this experiment. The feedback controller {{is based on}} PID algorithm [5]. Digital filtering techniques were used to removed noise of electron beam position reading, to compensate eddy current effect of vacuum chamber, and to increase bandwidth of orbit feedback loop. The infrastructure of digital {{feedback system}} is composed of orbit acquisition system, gigabit fiber links, digital signal processing hardware and software, high precision digital-to-analog converters. The experimental results is presented in this report. ...|$|R
40|$|Initial commissionings of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 7 -GeV {{storage ring}} and its {{diagnostics}} {{systems have been}} done.
