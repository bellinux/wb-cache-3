40|$|AbstractTraditionally, bio-butanol is {{produced}} with the ABE (Acetone Butanol Ethanol) process using Clostridium species to ferment sugars from biomass. However, the route {{is associated with}} some disadvantages such as low butanol yield and by-product formation (acetone and ethanol). On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>butanol</b> can be directly produced from ethanol through aldol condensation over metal oxides/ hydroxyapatite catalysts. This paper suggests that the chemical conversion route is more preferable than the ABE process, because the reaction proceeds more quickly compared to the fermentation route and fewer steps are required {{to get to the}} product...|$|R
40|$|Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric {{analysis}} of headspace volatiles {{was performed on}} cultures of 11 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain each of Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas putrefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a distinctive series of odd-carbon methyl ketones, particularly 2 -nonanone and 2 -undecanone, and 2 -aminoacetophenone. The other strains failed to produce 2 -aminoacetophenone. Two sulfur compounds, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide, were present in strains of P. aeruginosa and in variable amounts in <b>other</b> species. <b>Butanol,</b> 2 -butanone, 1 -undecene, and isopentanol were also detected in P. aeruginosa cultures...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} butanol and ethanol as transportation fuels for gasoline-powered engines. This paper examines two aspects. First, the fuel properties of butanol and ethanol are examined and compared to each <b>other.</b> Consequently, <b>butanol</b> overcomes three deficiencies of ethanol. Butanol {{has a higher}} energy content, butanol-gasoline blends do not separate {{in the presence of}} water, and butanol can be blended with gasoline in any percentage, {{all the way up to}} 100 %. Second, a review of the fermentation technology is examined for both butanol and ethanol production. Both butanol and ethanol can be fermented from the same feedstocks, which include the sugar and starch crops and lignocellulosic fermentation from wood and crop residues, and fast-growing energy crops like hybrid poplar, switchgrass, and willow. Furthermore, the capital and facilities used to produce ethanol can be switched to butanol fermentation with minimal costs. Thus, society is able to transition away from ethanol and begin to produce butanol with minimal capital and infrastructure costs. Unfortunately, the main drawback to butanol fermentation is its low chemical yield. Until researchers discover or engineer new microorganisms that handle higher butanol concentrations, butanol may not be adapted as an alternative fuel...|$|R
5000|$|Both ethanol and {{methanol}} {{have been}} used as an automotive fuel. [...] While both can be obtained from petroleum or natural gas, ethanol has attracted more attention because it is considered a renewable resource, easily obtained from sugar or starch in crops and other agricultural produce such as grain, sugarcane, sugar beets or even lactose. Since ethanol occurs in nature whenever yeast happens to find a sugar solution such as overripe fruit, most organisms have evolved some tolerance to ethanol, whereas methanol is toxic. <b>Other</b> experiments involve <b>butanol,</b> which can also be produced by fermentation of plants. Support for ethanol {{comes from the fact that}} it is a biomass fuel, which addresses climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, though these benefits are now highly debated, including the heated 2008 food vs fuel debate.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{enhanced}} {{energy content}} and reduced hygroscopicity compared to ethanol, n-butanol is flagged as a next generation biofuel and platform chemical. In addition to conventional cellular systems, butanol bioproduction by enzyme cascades is gaining momentum due to simplified process control. In contrast to other bio-based alcohols like ethanol and isobutanol, cell-free butanol biosynthesis {{from the central}} metabolic intermediate pyruvate involves co-factors (NAD(P) H, CoA) and acetyl-CoA dependent intermediates, which complicates redox and energy balancing of the reaction system. We have devised a biochemical process for cell-free butanol production that only involves three enzyme activities, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} acetyl-CoA. Instead the process utilizes only NADH as the sole redox mediator. Central to this new process is the amino acid catalyzed enamine – aldol – condensation, which transforms acetaldehyde directly into crotonaldehyde. Subsequently, crotonaldehyde is reduced to n-butanol applying a 2 -enoate reductase and an alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. In essence, we achieved conversion of the platform intermediate pyruvate to n-butanol utilizing a biocatalytic cascade comprising only three enzyme activities and NADH as reducing equivalent. With reference to previously reported cell-free n-butanol reaction cascades, we have eliminated five enzyme activities and the requirement of CoA as co-factor. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates that n-butanol was synthesized at neutral pH and 50 °C. This integrated reaction concept allowed GC detection of all reaction intermediates and n-butanol production of 148 mg L- 1 (2 mM), which compares well with <b>other</b> cell-free <b>butanol</b> production processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of employing methylated used cooking oil (COME) as extractant to reduce end-product inhibition {{and to enhance}} solvent productivity in acetone-butanolethanol (ABE) fermentation was evaluated using oleyl alcohol as the standard butanol extractant. Fermentation was carried out at an initial glucose concentration of 40 g/l using TYA medium and shochu distillery waste as fermentation substrate. In the case of TYA medium, butanol production without solvent extractant ceased after 47 h cultivation at a concentration of 9. 8 g/l. The extractant coefficient of oleyl alcohol to butanol was {{more than three times}} that of COME to butanol. However, using COME as extractant, total butanol reached 12. 6 g/l. Using oleyl alcohol, as extractant, on the <b>other</b> hand, total <b>butanol</b> was 11. 9 g/l. In the case of shochu distillery waste, butanol production without solvent extractant ceased after 50 h cultivation at a concentration of 12. 5 g/l. The extractant coefficient of COME to butanol decreased; that of COME was 0. 8 and that of oleyl alcohol was 1. 0. Though butanol that extracted using COME as extractant was less than using oleyl alcohol, total butanol reached 16. 4 g/l and was similar to that using oleyl alcohol as extractant. This fact suggests that COME as extractant is more effective for the reduction of end-product inhibition. 前報で明らかにしたようにClostridium saccharoperdutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 の発酵原料として, 焼酎蒸留廃液は使用可能であった. そこで, この培養の生産性を向上させる目的で, 発酵生産物ブタノールによる阻害を軽減するために抽出剤による抽出発酵を検討した. 家庭から排出される食用廃油をメチルエステル化（COME）して発行試験を行った. ブタノールの抽出剤としてオレイルアルコールをコントロールとした. 発酵原料として, イモ焼酎蒸留廃液を, 標準培地としてTYAを用いた. その結果, オレイルアルコールと比較して, 食用廃油メチルエステル（COME）を用いた場合, 高いブタノール生産速度, ブタノール収率を得た...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{different}} solvent fractions (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and aqueous) of the methanol extract of Rumex hastatus(RH) leaves were evaluated for antioxidant activities. The {{ethyl acetate fraction}} possessed high amount of total polyphenolics (106. 3 ± 3. 93 mg GAE/g extract) while butanolic fraction was found with high flavonoid contents (59. 8 ± 1. 94 mg RTE/g extract) as compared to <b>other</b> solvent fractions. <b>Butanol</b> fraction exhibited most promising DPPH (EC 50 140 ± 0. 99 µg/ml), iron chelation (EC 50 70 ± 2. 1 µg/ml) and for phosphomolybdate (EC 50 31 ± 1. 25 µg/ml) scavenging activity. However, ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the highest scavenging potential for super oxide radicals (EC 50 40 ± 0. 78 µg/ml), ABTS radicals (EC 50 70 ± 2. 46 µg/ml), hydroxyl radicals (EC 50 9 ± 0. 56 µg/ml) and inhibition of β-carotene linoleic acid peroxidation (EC 50 54 ± 5. 67 µg/ml). Chloroform fraction showed the most potent antioxidant activities in scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (EC 50 48 ± 4. 89 µg/ml). The high correlation coefficient was found between EC 50 values of DPPH, superoxides, hydroxyl, hydrogen peroxide and ABTS radicals with total polyphenolic and flavonoids. HPLC studies of ethyl acetate fraction indicated the presence of luteolin (24. 67 ± 2. 90 mg/g extract), kaempherol (17. 03 ± 1. 67 mg/g extract), luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside (14. 73 ± 2. 17 mg/g extract) and rutin (8. 24 ± 1. 43 mg/g extract). Therefore, our study substantiated that RH leaves {{can be used as}} a good source of potential antioxidant or functional food material due to the presence of sufficient amount of phenolics such as luteolin and kaempherol...|$|R
40|$|The Bio Diesel Fuel (BDF) is {{anticipated}} as the sustainable renewable energy. Also, {{they are expected}} to solve the global warming. Especially, Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) which is made by transesterification of vegetable oil and methanol is expected, since it has good engine performance and low exhaust emissions. On the <b>other</b> hand, bio <b>butanol</b> is also expected recently, but Fatty Acid Butyl Ester (FABE) which made by butanol is scarcely studied. Therefore, this study was made on the use of FABE as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. In this paper, FABE was made from rapeseed oil and butanol, and then it was blended with gas oil in order to improve the properties of its. FABE mixing ratio was selected 5 % in volume because BDF is allowed blending up to 5 % in Japan. In addition, blended 10 % was also selected to declare the influence of FABE. Then the density and kinematic viscosity of FABE and gas oil blended fuels were measured. It can be seen that the gas oil addition can improve the properties of FABE. Finally, FABE blended fuels were burned in a conventional 320 -cc diesel engine. It was found that FABE 5 % and FABE 10 % had different trends. Although the particle matter (PM) in the exhaust gas of FABE 5 % was confirmed to be reduced from the gas oil, nitrogen oxides were increased. Conversely, PM of FABE 10 % was increased from the gas oil, but nitrogen oxides were slightly decreased. Moreover, the brake specific fuel consumption of FABE 5 % was higher than gas oil, but FABE 10 % was slightly lower than gas oil...|$|R
40|$|High {{production}} {{yields and}} productivities are requisites {{for the development}} of an industrial butanol production process based on biodiesel-derived crude glycerol. However, impurities present in this substrate and/or the concentration of glycerol itself can affect the microbial metabolism. In this work, the effect of crude glycerol concentration on the production of butanol and 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PDO) by Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 is studied. Also, the effect of acetate and butyrate supplementation to the culture medium and the culture medium composition are evaluated. The results showed a marked effect of crude glycerol concentration on the product yield. The competitive nature of butanol and 1, 3 -PDO pathways has been evident, and a shift to the butanol pathway once using higher substrate concentrations (up to 35 g l 1) was clearly observed. Butyrate supplementation to the culture medium resulted in a 45 % higher butanol titre, a lower production of 1, 3 -PDO and it decreased the fermentation time. Acetate supplementation also increased the butanol titre but the fermentation was longer. Even though glycerol consumption could not be increased over 32 g l 1, when the concentrations of NH 4 Cl and FeCl 2 were simultaneously increased, the results obtained were similar to those observed when butyrate was supplemented to the culture medium; a 35 % higher butanol yield at the expense of 1, 3 -PDO and a shorter fermentation. The results herein gathered suggest that there are <b>other</b> factors besides <b>butanol</b> inhibition and nutrient limitation that affect the glycerol consumption.
