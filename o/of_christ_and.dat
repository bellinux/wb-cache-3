5|$|According to Avery, Donatello's Ascension <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter {{may have}} been {{intended}} to share {{the front of the}} sarcophagus, further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman Calends of January, which was uncommon on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{charges of}} heresy for their Arminian beliefs, Presbyterian ministers Richard McNemar and John Thompson, along with Barton W. Stone {{and two other}} ministers, chose to {{withdraw}} from the Kentucky Synod and form the independent Springfield Presbytery in 1803. These ministers would later dissolve the Springfield Presbytery and become the founders of the American Restoration Movement, from which the Christian Church (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ)</b> <b>and</b> Churches of Christ denominations originate.|$|E

Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to {{in the shape of}} ritual offerings, symbolizing the Blood <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the Church.

Nearly all of the fraternal organizations of the New Kensington community were represented at the dedication ceremony.

5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley {{was born}} in Shelbyville, Kentucky on May 21, 1867; he was the eldest of seven {{children}} of William and Amanda (Owsley) Stanley. His father was a minister of the Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> served as a judge advocate {{on the staff of}} Joseph E. Johnston in the Confederate Army. His mother was the niece of former Kentucky governor William Owsley. He attended Gordon Academy in Nicholasville, Kentucky and the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) before graduating with an A.B. from Centre College in 1889. At both Centre and Kentucky A, he competed at the State Oratorical Contest, becoming the only such competitor to represent two different institutions.|$|E

5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or becoming part <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> {{being treated as}} if they had done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church <b>of</b> <b>Christ)</b> <b>and</b> how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

5|$|Ordained Catholics, as well {{as members}} of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an {{individual}} basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the Sisters of Mercy.|$|E
5|$|The eight strongest {{religious}} affiliations in {{the area}} (based on the 2006 census figures) were (in descending order): Anglican, Catholic, Uniting, Lutheran, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Presbyterian, Church <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> Baptist (a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and the Church of Christ, with 31 adherents). Also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation (67.3%) in the region {{in comparison to the}} Adelaide (and national) average. Christian belief (64.4%) is most prominent, with little growth in other religions.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E

5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E

5|$|This belief persisted {{into the}} Medieval era, with many {{scholars}} arguing that Virgil not only prophesied Christ {{prior to his}} birth but also {{that he was a}} pre-Christian prophet. Dante Alighieri included Virgil as a main character in his Divine Comedy, and Michelangelo included the Cumaean Sibyl on the ceiling painting of the Sistine Chapel (a reference to the widespread belief that the Sibyl herself prophesied the birth <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> Virgil used her prophecies to craft his poem). Modern scholars, such as Robin Nisbet, tend to eschew this interpretation, arguing that seemingly Judeo-Christian elements of the poem can be explained through means other than divine prophecy.|$|E
