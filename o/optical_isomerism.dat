40|$|The modal-Hamiltonian {{interpretation}} {{belongs to}} the modal family of interpretations of quantum mechanics. By endowing the Hamiltonian {{with the role of}} selecting the subset of the definite-valued observables of the system, it accounts for ideal and non-ideal measurements, and also supplies a criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements in the non-ideal case. It can be reformulated in an explicitly invariant form, in terms of the Casimir operators of the Galilean group, and the compatibility of the MHI with the theory of decoherence has been proved. Nevertheless, perhaps its main advantage in the eyes of a scientist is given by its several applications to well-known physical situations, leading to results compatible with experimental evidence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to add a new application to the list: the case of <b>optical</b> <b>isomerism,</b> which is a central issue for the philosophy of physics and of chemistry since it points to the core of the problem of the relationship between physics and chemistry.

40|$|The glutaconic acids {{constitute}} {{a group of}} unsaturated dibasic acids in which geometrical isomerism coexists with that of tautomeric mobility; the latter reaches its maximum in glutaconic acid itself where the three carbon system is activated by two terminal keto-enol systems so the whole is really a heptad system.

Introduction of electron releasing groups in the α, and/or β, and/or γ reduces this mobility so {{that in some cases}} most of the theoretically possible forms have been isolated.

30|$|Except for the tPAA-hydrolyzing enzymes, five β-peptidyl aminopeptidases (three BapA enzymes, one BapF enzyme, and one DmpA enzyme) {{are known}} as the enzymes hydrolyzing short β-{{peptides}} and β-amino-acid-containing peptides (Geueke and Kohler 2007; Heck et al. 2009; Fuchs et al. 2011). Their general reaction involves the N-terminal cleavage of β-amino acid units from oligopeptides, amides, and esters via an exo-type process. Geueke et al. (2006) demonstrated that BapA enzymes from 3 - 2 W 4 and Y 2 strains can accept β-dipeptides as substrates as well as β-tripeptides. They also investigated the hydrolysis of mixed β/α-tripeptides and suggested that a peptide required a β-amino acid unit at its N-terminus {{in order to be}} a substrate of BapA. The effects of the <b>optical</b> <b>isomerism</b> of the N-terminal unit in β-tripeptides on the hydrolysis by BapA enzymes indicated that the enzymes preferred the peptide with the l-configuration of the N-terminal unit as a substrate. Heck et al. (2006) examined the substrate specificity of DmpA and demonstrated that DmpA can cleave α-peptides in addition to β-peptides, but the hydrolysis rate of α-peptides was lower than that of β-peptides. According to the MEROPS database (Rawlings et al. 2010), these enzymes are classified into the peptidase family P 1 containing aminopeptidases and self-processing proteins. From structural features of DmpA and BapA, they belong to the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases that self-activate to produce two subunits (α and β-subunits) for forming the active enzymes (Merz et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|On-board {{hydrogen}} storage {{presents a}} challenging {{barrier to the}} use of hydrogen as an energy source because the performance of current storage materials falls short of platform requirements. Because boron is one of the lightest chemical elements that can form strong covalent bonds with hydrogen, it provides an excellent opportunity to design new lightweight materials on the basis of novel boron hydride building blocks. Realizing this potential requires an understanding of the electronic structure, chemical bonding, and stability of neutral and anionic BxHy clusters with variable stoichiometry. While a large number of boron hydride compounds are known, there are still entire classes of yet unknown neutral and anionic BxHy clusters and molecules with various new x/y ratios which may be good candidates for hydrogen storage or as intermediates of borane de-hydrogenation. The primary aim of this dissertation was to search for neutral and anionic BxHy clusters that are thermochemically stable towards hydrogen release and to understand the chemical bonding in these novel clusters. These goals were accomplished by performing an unbiased search for neutral and anionic global minimum BxHy clusters using ab initio methods. In addition to finding a rich variety of new neutral and anionic BxHy (x = 3 – 6 and y = 4 – 7) clusters that could be building blocks for novel hydrogen-boron materials during the course of conducting this research, <b>optical</b> <b>isomerism</b> was discovered in select neutral and anionic boron-hydride clusters. Furthermore, the transition from planar to 3 - dimensional geometries in global minimum B 6 Hx - clusters was discovered using ab initio techniques during this study. Chemical bonding analysis using the AdNDP method was performed for all global minimum structures and low-lying isomers. The chemical bonding pattern recovered by the AdNDP method in all cases is consistent with the geometric structure. The theoretical vertical detachment energies presented in this dissertation may help interpret future photoelectron spectroscopic studies of the anions presented here...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} in four parts. Part I describes the synthesis of the hydrocarbon 3 : 4 - 5 : 6 -dibenzocyclohepta- 3 : 5 -diene {{and the introduction of}} a carboxylic acid group into the diphenyl nucleus. Onexamination, no evidence of the existence of <b>optical</b> <b>isomerism</b> of the acid could be found. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the hydrocarbon, in ethanol solution, showed an inflection at 280 mu, which had hitherto not been recorded. The synthesis of 2 : 2 '-bisbromoethyldiphenyl is described. Condensations of this compound with piperidine gave an unbridged product instead of the expected diphenyl, bridged across the 2 : 2 '-positions with a chain of five atoms to form altogether a nine-membered bridging ring. Treatment of 2 : 2 '-bisbromoethyldiphenyl with diethyl malonate in the presence of sodium ethoxide resulted in loss of the elements of hydrogen bromide and formation of 2 : 2 '-divinyldiphenyl. 2 -Carbomethoxy- 2 '-carbomethoxymethyldiphenyl was synthesized and treated with finely divided sodium in xylene. Instead of the expected acyloin-type condensation, a condensation of the Dieckmann type took place, resulting in a diphenyl containing a six-membered bridging ring. Part II is devoted to the synthesis and reactions of 4 : 5 - 4 ': 5 '-tetramethyldiphenyl. This compound was prepared with the intention of introducing two chloromethyl groups in the 2 : 2 '-positions, and forming a bridging ring by suitable condensations. Only one chloromethyl group could be introduced in the diphenyl nucleus. Part III contains an account of the preparation of di-B-naphthol and the attempts to resolve it. Its dimenthoxyacetic ester was prepared but its dihydrogen succinate and dihydrogen phthalate could not be made. Part IV describes the synthesis of N-benzoyl- 2 '-bromo- 4 ': 6 '-dimethyldiphenylamine- 3 -carboxylic acid, although complete and final proof of its preparation was unobtainable. The treatment of 2 '-chloro-N-benzoyl- 6 -methyl-diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylic acid with lithium aluminium hydride is also described. <p...|$|E
