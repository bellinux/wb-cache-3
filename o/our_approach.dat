Using the open source Hadoop system, we evaluate <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> by comparing <b>our</b> impact predictions with predictions generated using existing data mining techniques, and with actual change sets obtained from bug reports.

We have compared the performance of <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> to the well-known background modeling technique. <b>Our</b> <b>approaches</b> reduce the average delay for moving object detection by up to 45. 5 % and decrease the memory consumption by up to approximately 14 %, while supporting equally accurate detection...|$|R

Both approaches are useful to perform a coarse level classification of fingerprint images before fingerprint authentication tasks. <b>Our</b> <b>approaches</b> are characterized by: (1) texture image descriptors based on pairs of multi-resolution decomposition methods that encode effectively global and local fingerprint information, with similarity measures used for fingerprint matching purposes, and (2) a novel multi-class object recognition method based on the Optimum Path Forest classifier. Experiments were carried out on the standard NIST- 4 dataset aiming to study the discriminative and scalability capabilities of <b>our</b> <b>approaches.</b> The high classification rates allow us demonstrate the feasibility and validity of <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> for characterizing fingerprint images accurately. ...|$|R

The problem of buffer insertion in a single net has been the focus of most previous researches. However, efficient algorithms for buffer insertion in whole circuits are generally needed. In this paper, we relate the timing constrained minimal buffer insertion problem to the min-cost flow dual problem, and propose two algorithms based on min-cost flow and min-cut techniques, respectively, to solve it in combinational circuits. We compare <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> to a traditional approach based on Lagrangian relaxation. Experimental results demonstrate that <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> are efficient and effective.

40|$|Abstract. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the {{de facto}} inter-domain routing {{protocol}} that connects autonomous systems (ASes). Despite its importance for the Internet infrastructure, BGP is vulnerable {{to a variety of}} attacks due to lack of security mechanisms in place. Many BGP security mechanisms have been proposed, however, none of them has been deployed because of either high cost or high complexity. The right trade-o between eciency and security has been ever challenging. In this paper, we attempt to trade-o between eciency and security by giving a little dose of trust to BGP routers. We present a new exible threat model that assumes for any path of length h, at least one BGP router is trustworthy, where h is a parameter that can be tuned according to security requirements. Based on this threat model, we present two new symmetric key approaches to securing BGP: the centralized key distribution approach and the distributed key distribution <b>approach.</b> Comparing <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> to the previous SBGP scheme, <b>our</b> centralized <b>approach</b> has a 98 % improvement in signature veri cation. <b>Our</b> distributed <b>approach</b> has equivalent signature generation cost as in SBGP and an improvement of 98 % in signature verication. Comparing <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> to the previous SPV scheme, <b>our</b> centralized <b>approach</b> has a 42 % improvement in signature generation and a 96 % improvement in signature verication. <b>Our</b> distributed <b>approach</b> has a 90 % improvement on signature generation cost and a 95 % improvement in signature verication verication. By combining <b>our</b> <b>approaches</b> with previous public key approaches, it is possible to simultaneously provide an increased level of security and reduced computation cost. ...|$|R
