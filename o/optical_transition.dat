2500|$|The {{dynamics}} {{is quite}} different for high energies, such as occur from an <b>optical</b> <b>transition</b> from a non-degenerate initial state with a high-symmetry (JT undistorted) equilibrium geometry into a JT distorted state. This leads the system to the region near the conical intersection of the JT-split APES in {{the centre of the}} figure. Here the nonadiabatic couplings become very large and the behaviour of the system cannot be described within the familiar Born-Oppenheimer (BO) separation between the electronic and nuclear motions. The nuclear motion ceases to be confined to a single, well-defined APES and the transitions between the adiabatic surfaces occur yielding effects like Slonzcewsky resonances. In molecules this is usually a femtosecond timescale, which amounts to ultrafast (femtosecond) internal conversion processes, accompanied by broad spectral bands also under isolated-molecule conditions and highly complex spectral features. Examples for these phenomena will be covered in Section [...]|$|E

5000|$|It is {{well known}} that the <b>optical</b> <b>transition</b> of {{electrons}} and holes in the solid state is a useful clue to understand the physical properties of the material. However, the dynamics of the carriers are affected by other carriers and not only by the periodic lattice potential. Moreover, the thermal fluctuation of each electron should be taken into account. Therefore a statistical approach is needed. To predict the <b>optical</b> <b>transition</b> with appropriate precision, one chooses an approximation, called the assumption of quasi-thermal distributions, of the electrons in the conduction band and of the holes in the valence band.

For MQWs, recombination dynamics of <b>optical</b> <b>transitions</b> in both In,,Ga 1 N/GaN and GaN/AlGa 1 N MQWs grown by different methods (MOCVD vs. MBE) are compared with each other as well as with GaN and InGaN epilayers to extrapolate the mechanisms and quantum efficiencies of the optical emissions in these structures.

A direct comparison between the Rabi oscillations and simulated Raman adiabatic passage along with a detailed theoretical analysis provide a wealth of information on the coherent spin dynamics and in particular reveal that decoherence and environmental fluctuations associated with the <b>optical</b> <b>transitions</b> affect the fidelity of the Rabi oscillations through relatively large jumps in the transition frequencies...|$|R

Simple relationships of the optical gap and absorption linewidth to tight-binding model parameters are found.

50|$|Addition {{to energy}} level shift, the DC {{electric}} field causes decrease of absorption coefficient. Because electron and hole {{are forced to}} opposite direction by the field, the overlap of relating valence and conduction band in transition is decreased. Thus, according to Fermi's golden rule, which says that transition probability {{is proportional to the}} overlap, <b>optical</b> <b>transition</b> strength is weakened.

Today Philips markets an Ambilight feature, lighting the wall behind a flat display to soften the viewing experience. HALOLIGHT could not be adapted for color TV, because color TV white balance (aka tracking from low to high brightness) was unpredictable. Since the white color temperature of the HALOLIGHT and the illuminated color screen could not be made equivalent, HALOLIGHT was withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|At {{moderate}} doping levels the dopant atoms create individual doping {{levels that}} {{can often be}} considered as localized states that can donate electrons or holes by thermal promotion (or an <b>optical</b> <b>transition)</b> to the conduction or valence bands respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an impurity band and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a degenerate semiconductor still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior {{is in many ways}} intermediary between semiconductor and metal.|$|E

5000|$|Ordinary {{spectroscopy}} {{is concerned}} with the spectra of single atoms or molecules. Here we outline the very different spectra of complexes consisting of two or more interacting atoms or molecules: the [...] "interaction-induced" [...] or [...] "collision-induced" [...] spectroscopy. Both ordinary and collision-induced spectra may be observed in emission and absorption and require an electric or magnetic multipole moment - in most cases an electric dipole moment - to exist for an <b>optical</b> <b>transition</b> to take place from an initial to a final quantum state of a molecule or a molecular complex. (For brevity of expression we will use here the term [...] "molecule" [...] interchangeably for atoms as well as molecules). A complex of interacting molecules may consist of two or more molecules in a collisional encounter, or else of a weakly bound van der Waals molecule. On first sight, it may seem strange to treat optical transitions of a collisional complex, which may exist just momentarily, for the duration of a fly-by encounter (roughly 10−13 seconds), {{in much the same way}} as this was long done for molecules in ordinary spectroscopy. But even transient complexes of molecules may be viewed as a new, [...] "supermolecular" [...] system which is subject to the same spectroscopic rules as ordinary molecules. Ordinary molecules may be viewed as complexes of atoms that have new and possibly quite different spectroscopic properties than the individual atoms the molecule consists of, when the atoms are not bound together as a molecule (or are not [...] "interacting").
