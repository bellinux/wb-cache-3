25|$|Yet, in {{attempting}} to show, in a mainstream movie, the reprehensibility of torture, and what was done in <b>our</b> <b>name,</b> the filmmakers seem to have conflated events, and in this they have generated a sore controversy: the chairs of two Senate committees {{have said that the}} information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done, without flinching from the horror of the acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal– the team behind The Hurt Locker– want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time, and the contradiction mars an ambitious project.|$|E

It {{was one of the}} first songs written for the group's debut studio album, DNA. Unlike most The X Factor (UK) alumni, the band were adamant on being involved with the writing of their first original single. Band member Perrie Edwards stressed, [...] "At the end of the day, it's <b>our</b> <b>name</b> on it. If we're not happy, then I think people will see straight through it."

500|$|In {{a meeting}} March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) {{unanimously}} {{passed a resolution}} proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, [...] "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen {{to the voice of}} the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support <b>our</b> <b>name</b> and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community." [...] At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott.

500|$|According to the 19th-century {{historian}} William Forbes Skene, {{the contract}} is evidence of an ancestral connection between clans Gregor and MacAulay. Within the bond, both Ardincaple and Glenstrae stated that they were offshoots of the same family: [...] "Alexander M'Gregor of Glenstray on the ane part and Awly M'Cawley of Ardingapill {{on the other part}} understanding ourselfs and <b>our</b> <b>name</b> to be M'Calppins of auld and to be our just and trew surname". Skene was of the opinion that the MacAulays did not descend from the Mediaeval earls of Lennox, and further concluded that Clan MacAulay was a member of Siol Alpin – a group of clans which could claim descent from Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) whom Scots considered to be their first king. Later historians have shown that such bonds were used by the MacGregors to secure allegiances with weaker clans, and that such a bond was may have been forced upon the MacAulays by the more powerful MacGregors.|$|E
