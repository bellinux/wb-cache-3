5|$|Dissuasion from voting. Dissuading or {{attempting}} to dissuade {{a person from}} voting verbally or in writing between nomination day and polling day is a criminal offence punishable with a fine of up to $2,000 <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 12 months' jail or both.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} barrel length, the PS90 is {{relatively}} compact and lightweight, {{with an overall}} length of 667mm (26.3in), and a weight of 3.4kg (7.5lb) with a fully loaded 50-round magazine. Due to the added barrel length, the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to 777m/s (2,550ft/s) with SS195LF ammunition, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 930m/s (3,050ft/s) with third-party ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Roman times, tigers {{were kept}} in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often {{provoked}} to fight humans and exotic beasts. Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power. Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $3,500 in the United States where a lion cost no more than $1,000.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye can see all of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|T. cruzi {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} through blood transfusions. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated antibodies), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether T. cruzi can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.|$|E

5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
5000|$|Robotic Inserter/Extractor devices {{can also}} be used for {{horizontal}} carousels. The robotic device is positioned in the front <b>or</b> rear of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three horizontal carousels tiered high. The robot grabs the tote required in the order and often replenishes at the same time <b>to</b> speed <b>up</b> throughput. The tote(s) are then delivered to conveyor which routes it to a work station for picking <b>or</b> replenishing. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> eight transactions per minute per unit can be done.

5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|Vega's {{spectral}} {{class is}} A0V, {{making it a}} blue-tinged white main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core. Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega's main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, {{a tenth of the}} Sun's. The current age of this star is about 455million years, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> about half its expected total main-sequence lifespan. After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M red giant and shed much of its mass, finally becoming a white dwarf. At present, Vega has more than twice the mass of the Sun and its full luminosity is about 40 times the Sun's value. However, because of its high rate of rotation, the pole is considerably brighter than the equator. Because it is seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity from Earth is notably higher, about 57 times the Sun's value. If Vega is variable, then it may be a Delta Scuti type with a period of about 0.107days.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games <b>or</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
