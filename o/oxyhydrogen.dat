5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an <b>oxyhydrogen</b> torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen polyoxides (also {{known as}} oxidanes, oxohydrogens, or <b>oxyhydrogens)</b> are {{chemical}} compounds that consist only of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} atoms, are bonded exclusively by single bonds (i.e., they are saturated), and are acyclic (have molecular structures containing no cycles or loops). They can, therefore, be classed as hydrogen chalcogenides.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher {{pressure}} than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (<b>oxyhydrogen).</b> Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
25|$|In outside vapor {{deposition}} or vapor axial deposition, {{the glass}} is formed by flame hydrolysis, a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H2O) in an <b>oxyhydrogen</b> flame. In outside vapor deposition {{the glass is}} deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short seed rod is used, and a porous preform, whose length is not limited {{by the size of}} the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous preform is consolidated into a transparent, solid preform by heating to about 1,800K (1,500°C, 2,800°F).|$|E

Its maximum speed was , {{but it was}} licensed by the Motor Transport Office, taxed by the German Revenue Department and patented by the German Reichs-Patent Amt. The car battery was re-charged by the motor when the car went downhill. Additional power {{to charge the battery}} was provided by a cylinder of compressed air which was re-charged by small air pumps activated by vibrations of the chassis and the brakes and by igniting <b>oxyhydrogen</b> gas. No production beyond the prototype was reported.|$|E
25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (Al2O3, pure corundum) and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide). Both {{have been}} synthesized {{in large quantities}} since {{the first decade of}} the 20th century via the Verneuil or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted <b>oxyhydrogen</b> blowpipe, with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E

2500|$|The Verneuil process, {{also called}} flame fusion, {{was the first}} commercially {{successful}} method of manufacturing synthetic gemstones, developed in the late 1800s [...] by the French chemist Auguste Verneuil. It is primarily used to produce the ruby and sapphire varieties of corundum, {{as well as the}} diamond simulants rutile and strontium titanate. The principle of the process involves melting a finely powdered substance using an <b>oxyhydrogen</b> flame, and crystallising the melted droplets into a boule. The process is considered to be the founding step of modern industrial crystal growth technology, and remains in wide use to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Oxy-fuel welding (commonly called {{oxyacetylene}} welding, oxy welding, or {{gas welding}} in the U.S.) and oxy-fuel cutting [...] are processes that use fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals, respectively.

[...] Pure oxygen, instead of air, is used to increase the flame temperature to allow localized melting of the workpiece material (e.g. steel) in a room environment.

2500|$|When {{initially}} {{outlining the}} process, Verneuil specified {{a number of}} conditions crucial for good results. These include: a flame temperature that is not higher than necessary for fusion; always keeping the melted product in the same part of the <b>oxyhydrogen</b> flame; and reducing the point of contact between the melted product and support to as small an area as possible. The average commercially produced boule using the process is [...] in diameter and [...] long, weighing about [...] The process can also be performed with a custom-oriented seed crystal to achieve a specific desired crystallographic orientation.|$|E
2500|$|One of Verneuil's {{sources of}} {{inspiration}} for developing his own method was {{the appearance of}} synthetic rubies sold by an unknown Genevan merchant in 1880. These [...] "Geneva rubies" [...] were dismissed as artificial at the time, but are now {{believed to be the}} first rubies produced by flame fusion, predating Verneuil's work on the process by 20 years. After examining the [...] "Geneva rubies", Verneuil came to the conclusion that it was possible to recrystallise finely ground aluminium oxide into a large gemstone. This realisation, along with the availability of the recently developed <b>oxyhydrogen</b> torch and growing demand for synthetic rubies, led him to design the Verneuil furnace, where finely ground purified alumina and chromium oxide were melted by a flame of at least , and recrystallised on a support below the flame, creating a large crystal. He announced his work in 1902, publishing details outlining the process in 1904.|$|E
2500|$|In 1902, the French chemist Auguste Verneuil {{developed}} {{a process for}} producing synthetic sapphire crystals. In the Verneuil process, named after him, fine alumina powder is added to an <b>oxyhydrogen</b> flame, and this is directed downward against a mantle. The alumina in the flame is slowly deposited, creating a teardrop shaped [...] "boule" [...] of sapphire material. Chemical dopants can be added to create artificial versions of the ruby, and all the other natural colors of sapphire, and in addition, other colors never seen in geological samples. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws that are found in natural stones. The disadvantage of Verneuil process is that the grown crystals have high internal strains. Many methods of manufacturing sapphire today are variations of the Czochralski process, which was invented in 1916 by Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a tiny sapphire seed crystal is dipped into a crucible made of the precious metal iridium or molybdenum, containing molten alumina, and then slowly withdrawn upward at a rate of 1 to 100mm per hour. The alumina crystallizes on the end, creating long carrot-shaped boules of large size up to 200kg in mass.|$|E

60|$|The long {{windows were}} wide open, {{and the soft}} night air flowed in with the faint scent of flowers, and a murmur of voices from the {{specially}} invited audience Miss Earle had bestowed in the tennis green, which was sunk a few feet on one side {{below the level of}} the sweep of lawn. Tennis was not a game she was fond of, and she had pacified the gardener by placing the chair legs on boards. Tony could see the shadowy mass of humanity showing black against a dazzling glare, for the big <b>oxyhydrogen</b> lights he had provided were then blazing in front of the proscenium, which had been extemporized on the verge of the higher level. The path that led to it wound along the edge of a tall shrubbery where colored lights blinked here and there amidst the dusky leaves.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} when I was arranging my insects, {{and surrounded by}} a crowd of wondering spectators, I showed one of them how {{to look at a}} small insect with a hand-lens, which caused such evident wonder that all the rest wanted to see it too. I therefore fixed the glass firmly to a piece of soft wood at the proper focus, and put under it a little spiny beetle of the genus Hispa, and then passed it round for examination. The excitement was immense. Some declared it was a yard long; others were frightened, and instantly dropped it, and all were as much astonished, and made as much shouting and gesticulation, as children at a pantomime, or at a Christmas exhibition of the <b>oxyhydrogen</b> microscope. And all this excitement was produced by a little pocket lens, {{an inch and a half}} focus, and therefore magnifying only four or five times, but which to their unaccustomed eyes appeared to enlarge a hundred fold.|$|E
