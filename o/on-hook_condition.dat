25|$|An <b>on-hook</b> <b>condition</b> {{represents}} an idle circuit, i.e. no phone call is in progress.|$|E
5000|$|An {{operating}} state of a telecommunication circuit in which transmission is disabled {{and a high}} impedance, or [...] "open circuit", is presented to the link by the end instrument(s). Note: during the <b>on-hook</b> <b>condition,</b> the link is responsive to ringing signals.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{types of}} loop {{signaling}} are {{signals to the}} central office that the subscriber intends to initiate a second simultaneous call, a three-way conference call, or answer a second incoming call. This signal is called flashing or hook flash, and is performed by interrupting the loop {{for a fraction of}} a second, typically at least 300 ms. The flash signal is longer than a rotary dial pulse, sometimes called a short flash, and is shorter than the time required for the <b>on-hook</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Signaling: Signaling {{is often}} {{referred}} to as supervision. The circuit detects the <b>on-hook</b> and off-hook <b>conditions</b> by monitoring the loop current. In rotary dial systems, it decodes dial pulses. It includes decoding of dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) dialing, hook flash, and other signals.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} viewpoint: that of the {{telephone}} industry, where ISDN is a core technology. A telephone network {{can be thought of}} as a collection of wires strung between switching systems. The common electrical specification for the signals on these wires is T1 or E1. Between telephone company switches, the signaling is performed via SS7. Normally, a PBX is connected via a T1 with robbed bit signaling to indicate <b>on-hook</b> or off-hook <b>conditions</b> and MF and DTMF tones to encode the destination number. ISDN is much better because messages can be sent much more quickly than by trying to encode numbers as long (100 ms per digit) tone sequences. This results in faster call setup times. Also, a greater number of features are available and fraud is reduced.|$|R
40|$|A {{signal line}} driving circuit with power control for {{selectively}} reducing internal power dissipation when driving an external load. While driving the external load with a constant current the output voltage generated across such load is monitored. If the load impedance decreases sufficiently {{to cause the}} output voltage to fall below a predetermined threshold value and, therefore, cause the voltage across the signal line driving circuit to increase, {{the magnitude of the}} power supply voltage is automatically reduced, thereby reducing the voltage across the signal line driving circuit. Such a signal line driving circuit is particularly advantageous as a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC). As the subscriber goes from an <b>on-hook</b> <b>condition</b> to an off-hook condition and if the subscriber loop is sufficiently short (or low in impedance), a lower power supply voltage is used to minimize the power dissipation of the SLIC while still maintaining the required subscriber loop current...|$|E
