5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E

25|$|Repin was {{the first}} Russian artist to achieve European fame using {{specifically}} Russian themes. His 1873 painting Barge Haulers on the Volga, radically different from previous Russian paintings, made him {{the leader of a}} new movement of critical realism in Russian art. He chose nature and character over academic formalism. The triumph of this work was widespread, and it was praised by contemporaries like Vladimir Stasov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The paintings show his feeling <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the hard life of the common people and the destiny of Russia. In the 1880s he produced many of his most famous works, and joined the Itinerants' Society.|$|E

25|$|In {{psychological}} {{research on}} altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial {{behaviors such as}} helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people {{are most likely to}} help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness {{with a high level of}} empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, is the lack <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", {{in reference to the}} words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.|$|E

Then, in the section [...] "Grimmer Theory", he [...] "shows that the twentieth century's intellectuals have provided members of the underclass with a battery of rationalizations by which they can shift the blame for their misery away from their actions and attitudes and can unleash their hatred of everyone who challenges their outlook.". Focusing on ideas more than events, this section considers the concepts of relativism, determinism, and egalitarianism, and how each idea, in their creation by the bourgeoisie intellectuals, adversely affects the underclass.|$|E

[...] The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by William Darrow, but it was called into question by University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Andrew Moss.

Author Douglas Crimp suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as [...] "murderously irresponsible" [...] is in actuality [...] "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a [...] "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that , like them, is horrified by such creatures." [...] Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.|$|E

2500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has expressed}} {{the view that}} certain features of the MRHA remove any transparency over the Council's proceedings, {{making it impossible to}} discover if it has been performing its duties satisfactorily and to hold them accountable for any lack of conscientiousness. For one, the secrecy of the PCRH's workings is protected by section 7 of the MRHA, shielding their conclusions and recommendations from public scrutiny. Secondly, the prevention of judicial review by section 18 of the Act means that explanations in court which can be publicly accessible later cannot be extracted. These control mechanisms and protective provisions of the Act are said to have cumulatively made it impossible to determine what religious behaviour is allowed or disallowed. On the other hand, {{it has been argued that}} without the interposition of judicial review, the Government is able to use the MRHA's nebulous nature to specify norms of acceptable interaction between religious communities as it seeks to [...] "propagate an ethic <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> and intercultural tolerance".|$|E
