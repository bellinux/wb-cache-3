5|$|He {{was arrested}} in 2002 for interfering with police {{investigating}} a code violation at a restaurant he owned; the charges were eventually dropped. After settling down in Newport Beach, California, the police appeared over 70 times at his home because <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> parties. In early 2003, Rodman {{was arrested and charged}} with domestic violence at his home in Newport Beach for allegedly assaulting his then-fiancee.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, {{independent of}} {{the truth of the}} Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain wrote of the creature's existence in the early seventeenth century. However, no concrete evidence of such writings has been uncovered, even though Champlain did write <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> screams from sea monsters living in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of the}} state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> and exuberant cheers.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} <b>of</b> <b>loud,</b> {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar {{works in conjunction with}} the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big {{for just a few}} birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
5000|$|The Italian issues {{include a}} bonus track, [...] "Amo, T'Amo, Ti Amo" [...] (the Italian version of [...] "Still in Love"). Also worth noting, some issues <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than Words omit the track, [...] "Now You're Gone".|$|R
60|$|Idella woke {{with the}} rush of cold air, and {{in the dark and}} strangeness began to cry, and wailed heart-breakingly between her fits <b>of</b> <b>louder</b> sobbing, and then fell asleep again before they reached the house where her father lay dying.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015, Louder Than War {{announced}} {{they were also}} creating a print/magazine version of the website. The first issue <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than War magazine was published by Big Cheese Publishing Ltd in autumn 2015 and followed a similar style and format to the website.|$|R
5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, the SS V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E

50|$|The term verrophone {{originally}} {{referred to}} a glass harp. Previous glass instruments include the glass harmonica and arrangements of ordinary drinking glasses (approximately glass tubes closed at one end). The verrophone is capable <b>of</b> <b>louder</b> dynamics than the glass harp due to its larger radiating surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The 2012 album, Shattered Dreams Parkway again {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{from the likes}} <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than War, Big Cheese, Leeds music Scene, Lights Go Out Fanzine and many more.

25|$|It is a noisy {{bird with}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> calls. It calls most often early and late in the day, usually from the ground but {{sometimes}} from trees. Pairs often call together and up to 12 birds have been heard in one area.|$|E
25|$|Different {{whistling}} styles {{may be used}} in {{a single}} language. Sochiapam Chinantec has three different words for whistle-speech: sie3 for whistling with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, jui̵32 for bilabial whistling, and juo2 for finger-in-the-mouth whistling. These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> falsetto (hóh32) which functions in some ways like whistled speech.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the torture}} {{techniques}} used were developed at Guantánamo detention centre, including prolonged isolation; the frequent flier program, a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they couldn’t sleep for days, weeks, even months, short-shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use {{of heat and}} cold; the use <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> music and noise and preying on phobias.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{positively}} received by most, with Phil Newall <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> than War calling it [...] "a fitting tribute to Klaus Dinger and a suitable closure {{for the entire}} La Dusseldorf project".

60|$|Still he {{lay there}} {{watching}} and listening, and by and by a puff of warm air blew across the sand, and a thumping tumble <b>of</b> <b>louder</b> thunder leaped from out {{the belly of the}} storm cloud, which every minute was coming nearer and nearer. Still Tom Chist lay watching.|$|R
5000|$|Dave Wood <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than the Music {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars commenting on how Smith [...] "able to produce albums {{of the highest}} [...]" [...] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard gave the album a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Michael has never sounded more compelling or impassioned." ...|$|R
25|$|Holmes {{was born}} in Sampson County, North Carolina, in 1804. His father, Gabriel Holmes, was a former Governor of North Carolina and U.S. Congressman. After a failed attempt at {{plantation}} managing, Holmes asked his father for an appointment to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1829. He was ranked 44 out of 46, in his class. Holmes was apparently quite deaf, and was almost never aware <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> gunfire.|$|E
25|$|Other {{introduced}} species include cane toads imported in 1937, the giant African snail (an agricultural pest introduced during World WarII by Japanese occupation troops) {{and more recently}} frog species which could threaten crops {{in addition to providing}} additional food for the brown tree snake population. Reports <b>of</b> <b>loud</b> chirping frogs native to Puerto Rico and known as coquí, that may have arrived from Hawaii, have led to fears that the noise could threaten Guam's tourism.|$|E
25|$|In the 25th anniversary reunion {{episode of}} I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, John Cleese {{consents}} {{to appear on}} the show on condition that he be allowed to do the Silly Walk; the other cast members are dubious about the comedic impact of doing the Walk on radio, but they ultimately give in after Cleese puts on a show of hurt feelings. Near the end of the show, Cleese presents the Silly Walk, rendered on radio as a series <b>of</b> <b>loud,</b> slow footsteps.|$|E
5000|$|Christopher Lloyd <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than War {{retrospectively}} {{called the}} album [...] "a solid piece of work."xsilence noted how, instead of transitioning into a Britpop band, as multiple [...] "noisy groups" [...] {{did at the}} time, Ned's Atomic Dustbin surprisingly took [...] "the option to integrate electronic sounds into their scabby rock." ...|$|R
5000|$|Portions <b>of</b> <b>Loud's</b> {{memorial}} {{gathering in}} the garden of Hollywood's Chateau Marmont are included in the documentary, A Death in An American Family, including tributes by his many friends.

5000|$|This line-up issued their sixth studio album, Incantations, in June 2014. Gus Ironside <b>of</b> <b>Louder</b> Than War rated it as 9 out of 10 {{and felt}} it was [...] "a highly melodic album, packed with hooks and {{insidious}} tunes, it's a tightly-coiled brute, as claustrophobically dense with detail as it is outright rocking." ...|$|R
