5|$|Wilfrid {{refused to}} be consecrated in Northumbria {{at the hands of}} Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid {{considered}} to have been validly consecrated he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris. During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself {{in a small town}} facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E

25|$|Orlando de Lassus {{was born}} in Mons in the County of Hainaut, Habsburg Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). Information about his early years is scanty, {{although}} some uncorroborated stories have survived, the most famous <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was kidnapped three times because of the singular beauty of his singing voice. At the age of twelve, he left the Low Countries with Ferrante Gonzaga and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style.|$|E

25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her daughter is dying in hospital after an illegal abortion went wrong.|$|E
25|$|The SVR {{have been}} offered first refusal by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. on the all-important tunnel under Bridgnorth as the first {{essential}} part of the plan. If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, not least <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all of the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel. The group currently promoting such an extension has identified a viable technical solution to this and other difficulties.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{reviews for}} The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were {{generally}} unfavorable.

500|$|Several {{theories}} have been advanced {{to account for}} the incorporation of shoes into the fabric of a building, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they served as some kind of fertility charm. There is a long-standing connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by the nursery rhyme, [...] "There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe", and the custom of casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her honeymoon or attaching shoes to the departing couple's car. Archaeologist Ralph Merrifield has observed that in the English county of Lancashire women who wished to conceive might try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth, a custom known as smickling.|$|E
500|$|Hippeastrum is a genus in {{the family}} Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and {{subtribe}} Hippeastrineae) The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means [...] "Knight's-star-lily", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the common name [...] "amaryllis" [...] is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{studies of}} the {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of the populations of C. mutica reveal high genetic diversity in the Sea of Japan region, unequivocally identifying it as their native range. In contrast, non-native populations in North America, Europe, and New Zealand had poor variation. The detection of genetic material present in non-native populations, however, also make it probable that there are unknown regions that C. mutica may also be native to; though {{it might also be}} simply that the sample groups used in the studies were too small. Comparisons of mtDNA of the different populations make it possible to trace the possible routes of introduction. The most likely <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the original non-native introduction was to the west coast of North America, which exhibit the highest genetic diversity in non-native populations. Multiple later introductions happened in Europe and eastern North America. From here, additional populations were transported to nearby ports. [...] Europe and eastern North America are also the possible sources for the New Zealand C. mutica population.|$|E

500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow.

McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think {{you can imagine how}} Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation".

500|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{returns from}} {{a weekend in}} Paris with Phoebe, his new fiancée, and insists that Liz should get to know Phoebe better. He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day {{progresses}} Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by [...] "Avian Bone Syndrome," [...] a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her purportedly brittle bones {{would not be able}} to stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{appeared}} in print later, Philip Sidney's three sestinas {{may have been}} written earlier, and are often credited as the first in English. The first published (toward the end of Book I of The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, 1590) is the double sestina [...] "Ye Goatherd Gods". In this variant the standard end-word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas, ending with a three-line envoi, resulting in a poem of 75 lines. Two others were published in subsequent editions of the Arcadia. The second, [...] "Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow", is in the [...] "standard" [...] form. Like [...] "Ye Goatherd Gods" [...] it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian endecasillabo. The third, [...] "Farewell, O sun, Arcadia's clearest light", is the first rhyming sestina in English: it is in iambic pentameters and follows the standard end-word scheme, but rhymes ababcc in the first stanza (the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza, a consequence <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets). Sidney uses the same envoi structure as Spenser. William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas (which he called [...] "sextains") in 1616, which copy the form of Sidney's rhyming sestina. After this, there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years, with John Frederick Nims noting that, [...] "...there {{is not a single}} sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." ...|$|E
