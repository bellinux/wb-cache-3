5|$|Born {{in a small}} farming {{community}} in West Virginia, Lazzell traveled to Europe twice, studying in Paris with French artists Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, and André Lhote. In 1915, she began spending her summers in the Cape Cod art community of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and eventually settled there permanently. She {{was one of the}} founding members of the Provincetown Printers, a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> experimented with a white-line woodcut technique based on the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints.|$|E
5|$|Laura Johnson and Harold Knight {{married in}} 1903 {{and made their}} {{first trip to the}} Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905. They visited the artists colony at Laren. The colony was a group of {{followers}} of the Hague School <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> had been painting in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Peggy Rockman {{was one of}} {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> first learned {{painting}} through a course run in 1986 at Lajamanu by an adult education officer, John Quinn, associated with the local Technical and Further Education unit. The course, initially attended only by men, eventually enrolled over a hundred community members. Others who began their painting careers through that course include Mona Rockman Napaljarri and Louisa Napaljarri. Western Desert artists such as Peggy Rockman will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights, which in Peggy's case include Ngatijirri (budgerigar), Warna (snake), Laju and Ngarlu.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they {{are thought to be}} powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E
5|$|Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet {{worked on}} setting {{the design and}} overall look of the {{character}}s. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.|$|E

5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted by a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single block of wood. Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Since Smallville began airing, {{a variety}} of {{merchandise}} connected with the series has been produced. Two soundtrack albums of songs from the show have been released. On February 25, 2003 Smallville: The Talon Mix, with a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> licensed their music for the show, was issued. Smallville: The Metropolis Mix, with another group of artists, was released on November 8, 2005. In addition to the soundtracks, action figures, T-shirts, hats and posters have been produced. In December 2002 autographed Smallville merchandise was listed for auction on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity. In 2003, Titan Magazines began publishing a monthly Smallville magazine with cast and crew interviews, information on Smallville merchandise and photos. The 34th and final issue was published in November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, Skagen {{became the}} summer venue of a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> were {{attracted}} by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.|$|E

5|$|She {{learned to}} draw during her {{schooling}} at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first {{experience as a}} painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai {{was one of a}} range <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with {{a significant role in the}} centre's establishment. She began with screen printing and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.|$|E
