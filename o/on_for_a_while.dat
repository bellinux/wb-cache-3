5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

The main line between this point and the southern junction, through Elvington Halt, was apparently kept <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> as part of the internal colliery rail system.

500|$|The {{resignation}} of Saleh and Atmar came amidst heavy disagreement between Hamid Karzai and Amrullah Saleh {{on how to}} proceed against the Taliban. [...] Daoud Sultanzoi, {{a member of the}} Afghan parliament, said, he had observed that disagreement between Karzai on the one side and cabinet members such as Saleh and Atmar on the other side had been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Saleh publicly blamed Pakistan for its support to the Taliban and other extremist groups and said talks with the Taliban should take place but not at the cost of democratic structures. Meanwhile, Karzai had increasingly been placing his hopes on his attempts to reach a secret deal with the Taliban and Pakistan. Pakistan had repeatedly urged Karzai to oust Saleh from his position.|$|E
500|$|Although Zappa {{eventually}} {{gained the}} rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and original Mothers of Invention bassist Roy Estrada joined. Among other musicians were bassist Patrick O'Hearn, singer-guitarist Ray White and keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the NBC television show Saturday Night Live. Zappa's song [...] "I'm the Slime" [...] was performed with a voice-over by SNL booth announcer Don Pardo, who also introduced [...] "Peaches En Regalia" [...] on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member John Belushi during the instrumental piece [...] "The Purple Lagoon".

2500|$|Candlepins for Cash, being Boston's {{regional}} {{version of}} Claster Television's Bowling for Dollars franchise, devolved from a competitive nature {{to more of}} a game show format. Bowlers were introduced one by one to win money and prizes by how well they did on the lanes. Also featured a special [...] "red pin" [...] which was worth extra cash if felled on a strike. WNAC taped the show in studio on lanes built specially for the show (there were two lanes in the studio alley). When WNAC chose not to renew the show in April 1980, production moved that fall to WXNE, Channel 25, which taped the show at an actual bowling alley, the Wal-Lex Lanes in Waltham, Massachusetts. Host Bob Gamere stayed <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> after the station switch, but after he left, WXNE hired former Boston Red Sox star Rico Petrocelli as the new host.|$|E

In the aftermath, negotiations were opened between Afonso and the Moroccan strongman Muhammad al-Sheikh to deliver the bones and bodily remains of Ferdinand, which were still in Fez. These negotiations dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but the remains were finally obtained by the Portuguese in 1473 (or perhaps 1472) [...] One version relates that a disgruntled Moroccan courtier, said to be the ruler's own nephew, seized the coffin containing Ferdinand's body, smuggled it out of Fez, and brought {{it all the way to}} Lisbon to sell to the Portuguese king for a considerable sum. There were subsequently great ceremonies in depositing the bodily remains in Ferdinand's tomb in Batalha.|$|E

2500|$|During the night, Vice-Admiral James Somerville crossed from England and met Nicholson, {{who said}} that with more guns he could hold <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> longer and they agreed that the ships in the port should return. At dawn on 25 May, the German {{bombardment}} resumed, concentrating on the old town, where buildings fell into streets, high winds fanned fires everywhere and smoke from explosions and the fires blocked the view. The last guns of the 229th Anti-Tank Battery were knocked out and only three tanks of the 3rd RTR remained operational. Distribution of rations and ammunition was difficult and after the water mains were broken, water could only be taken from derelict wells. At [...] Schaal sent the mayor, André Gerschell, to ask Nicholson to surrender but Gerschell was sent back with a refusal. At noon, Schaal offered another opportunity to surrender and extended the [...] deadline to [...] when he found that his emissaries had been delayed, only to be refused again. The German bombardment increased during the day, despite attempts by Allied ships to bombard German gun emplacements. In the east, the 1st Rifle Brigade and parties of the QVR on the outer ramparts and the Marck and Calais canals repulsed a determined attack. The French then eavesdropped on a German wireless message, which disclosed that the Germans were going to attack the perimeter on the west side, held by the 2nd KRRC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E
