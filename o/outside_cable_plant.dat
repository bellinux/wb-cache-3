5000|$|DS1 {{signals are}} {{interconnected}} typically at Central Office locations at a common metallic cross-connect point {{known as a}} DSX-1. When a DS1 is transported over metallic <b>outside</b> <b>plant</b> <b>cable,</b> the signal travels over conditioned cable pairs known as a T1 span. A T1 span can have up to +-130 Volts of DC power superimposed on the associated four wire cable pairs to line or [...] "Span" [...] power line repeaters, and T1 NIU's (T1 Smartjacks). T1 span repeaters are typically engineered up to 6000 ft apart, depending on cable gauge, and at no more than 36 dB of loss before requiring a repeated span. There can be no cable bridge taps or Load Coils across any pairs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Outside</b> <b>plant</b> <b>cabling,</b> whether copper or fiber, is {{generally}} installed as aerial cable between poles, in an underground conduit system, or by direct burial.Hardware {{associated with the}} outside plant must be either protected from the elements (for example, distribution frames are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the outside plant elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults. In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While {{this is not a}} modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older cabling with sealed cabling is often prohibitively expensive. The cabling used in the outside plant must also be protected from electrical disturbances caused by lightning or voltage surges due to electrical shorts or induction.|$|R

40|$|The local <b>cable</b> network (<b>cable</b> <b>plant)</b> {{is a part}} {{of public}} {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN) which connects local telephone exchanges with customer’s premises equipment (CPE). It is built up of multipair twisted cables. Cable pairs are twisted to avoid mutual influence (crosstalks) among the pairs. Cable construction is developed for transmission of voice frequencies and it remains almost the same for some decades. This <b>cable</b> <b>plant</b> works well for telephone transmission even if all cable pairs are active. In the eightees ISDN technology appeared which transmitted signals up to 60 kHz and soon it became clear that only 70 % to 80 % of cable pairs met technical requirements for this technology. The main obstacle was mutual influence among pairs (crosstalks) which increases with frequency. Next came another transmission technologies as HDSL, ADSL, SHDSL, which were designed to connect PBX exchsnges to the PSTN and to deliver Internet to the customer’s home. All these technologies are called xDSL. Nowadays some new technologies appear, but the principles and line codes are the same (2 B 1 Q, PAM- 16, DMT). In general, transmission of signals with frequencies up to 1 MHz over local telephone lines is quite common now. Technologies up to 2 MHz or even 8 MHz (over short lines) are coming soon. Most widespread is the ADSL service, so it is important for operator company to make evaluation of practically achievable penetration of ADSL service over existing local <b>cable</b> <b>plant</b> [1]...|$|R
