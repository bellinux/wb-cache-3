5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Porter sold the paper in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business. Wilkes owned the surviving paper until his death in 1885.|$|E

Supporters, including Boucicault himself, responded that worse women were regularly portrayed in Italian operas such as La traviata and Lucrezia Borgia, which were considered eminently suitable for young women, and in the police and court news <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E

5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E

40|$|Background: Children with leukemia {{often have}} {{hepatosplenomegaly}} present. This can {{be diagnosed with}} physical examination and confirmed with ultrasound.
