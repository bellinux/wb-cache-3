Further, he was critical of the inclusion of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] and [...] "Ave Maria", considering them to be overly predictable song choices. Though he was pleasantly surprised by some of the inclusions (such as [...] "River of Light" [...] and [...] "The Way Old Friends Do"), he concluded that [...] "t's too bad that [...] isn't given more creative material to sing. <b>One</b> <b>hopes</b> her next album is more adventurous." ...|$|E

Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and clear as a bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am I going to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, described the track as [...] "a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution {{with a series of}} drab johns".|$|E

500|$|Rumours {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} by music critics since its release. Robert Christgau, reviewing in The Village Voice, gave the album an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as}} [...] "more consistent and more eccentric" [...] than its predecessor. He added that it [...] "jumps {{right out of the}} speakers at you". Rolling Stone magazine's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album's most pleasing elements; he stated, [...] "Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, Rumours proves that the success of Fleetwood Mac was no fluke." [...] In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell said the album is [...] "a delightful disk, and <b>one</b> <b>hopes</b> the public thinks so, too", while Dave Marsh of the St. Petersburg Times claimed the songs are [...] "as grandly glossy as anything right now". Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called Rumours a [...] "frustratingly uneven" [...] record in his review for the Los Angeles Times, while Juan Rodriguez of The Gazette suggested that, while the music is [...] "crisper and clearer", Fleetwood Mac's ideas are [...] "slightly more muddled". The album finished fourth in The Village Voices 1977 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, <b>one</b> <b>hopes</b> that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man <b>one</b> <b>hopes</b> for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 stars out of 4 and said, [...] "Even with its big-screen {{pyrotechnics}} and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version {{of one of}} the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way." [...] Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film 8.4/10, describing it as being:"terrific, a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern; Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series’ 50th anniversary." [...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung [...] "injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration", and went on by saying, [...] "While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling [...] as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: [...] "a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that’s because it’s basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn’t take you to many new frontiers." [...] Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond [...] "a somewhat diverting place holder, but <b>one</b> <b>hopes</b> that the next Star Trek movie will {{have what it takes to}} boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before." [...] Mark Hugues of Forbes said, [...] "Star Trek Beyond is the third-best Star Trek film of all time, creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar, powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top-notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contacts Borg Queen." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{before its}} release, Sacred Evil– A True Story faced a {{petition}} which challenged the Censor Board's decision to grant an exhibition certificate to the film. The petition, filed by lawyer Gerry Coelho, contended that granting the certificate to the film, was unethical and indecent {{on the part}} of the Censor Board of India and constituted total non-application of mind. The objections raised by Coelho were based on the film's posters and promotional advertisements. The Censor Board said that they had not been insensitive to Christian sentiments. [...] "We are very careful when we screen sensitive movies [...] But, there is nothing in the movie that is objectionable, or will hurt the sentiments of the community in question." [...] The film was given green signal by the censor board, but was still postponed because of non-availability of theatres. It was finally released on 23 June 2006, and was a commercial disappointment but received mixed reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama commented: [...] "Sacred Evil is a pleasant change and a break from the monotony of the regular Hindi films. However, the subject is one that caters to a niche audience only. However, the fact cannot be denied that the narrative does not go off-track nor does it seem as if some sequences have been incorporated for the sake of it. Despite its slow pacing, Sacred Evil has the knack to hold the interest of its viewer. It's definitely a fine effort by directors Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha. The performances are above average, with Sarika dominating the show." [...] Deepali Singh from The Kolkata Telegraph gave the film three out of ten, stating [...] "If <b>one</b> <b>hopes</b> to discover the secrets of Wiccan ways in Sacred Evil, directed by Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha, one is in for a major disappointment. Beyond a candlelit session, which doesn't really lead anywhere except to a few flickers of vague shadows in the background, the story just about treads into the Wiccan world. [...] Sarika, as Ipsita, ghost walks through another expressionless comeback." ...|$|E
