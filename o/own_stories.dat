5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} Arkham Originss boss battles were {{one area of}} {{improvement}} over its predecessors; they offered dynamic, multiphase conflicts with their <b>own</b> <b>stories.</b> While not considering all equally fun or impressive, reviewers said that their variety and unpredictability provided excitement. Less-notable characters from the comics were considered less compelling than more-popular characters.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his <b>own</b> <b>stories,</b> no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

5|$|Philippine mythology {{has been}} handed down {{primarily}} through the traditional oral folk {{literature of the}} Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang, the manananggal, the diwata/engkanto, and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling, Lam-Ang, and the Sarimanok.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} based on Digital Devil Story, {{a science fiction}} novel series by Aya Nishitani. The series {{takes its name from}} the first book's subtitle. Most Megami Tensei titles are stand-alone entries with their <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> and characters. Recurring elements include plot themes, a story shaped by player choices, and game mechanics, the most notable being the ability to fight using and often recruit creatures (Demons, Persona) to aid the player in battle. Elements of multiple philosophies and religions, occultism, cyberpunk and early science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times.|$|E
5|$|Peter is now {{forced into}} helping Tyler, who has mind control powers {{due to his}} father James (Andrew Airlie) working on thought-controlled weapons systems for Massive Dynamic.

Their destination {{is the home of}} Tyler's mother, whom Tyler had been told was dead. When the two of them meet, Tyler wants her to run off {{so that they can be}} together again. She refuses, and Tyler becomes enraged at her husband when he returns home.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E

25|$|Cody's {{early life}} is {{difficult}} to separate from his <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> told later in life, but he was born Samuel Franklin Cowdery in 1867, in Davenport, Iowa, where he attended school {{until the age of}} 12. Not much is known about his life at this time, although he claimed that during his youth he had lived the typical life of a cowboy. He learned how to ride and train horses, shoot and use a lasso.

Flint always publishes one of his <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> within the short fiction collections, {{or in the case}} of , considerably more, as it introduces several important background factors that are central to further series developments as the altered history is to unfold to the reader.|$|E
