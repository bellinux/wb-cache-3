60|$|The Angel {{lay upon}} {{the summit of}} the cliff above Bandram Bay, and stared out at the {{glittering}} sea. Sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff, five hundred and seven feet of it down to the datum line, and the sea-birds eddied and soared below him. The upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock, the lower two-thirds a warm <b>red,</b> <b>marbled</b> with gypsum bands, and from half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to fall in long cascades down its face. The swell frothed white on the flinty beach, and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay, was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below. Now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff, and a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither.|$|R

60|$|It may {{be worth}} while briefly to give the {{well-known}} history of one class of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (R. spinosissima) were transplanted into a garden (10/181. Mr. Sabine in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 285.); and one of these bore flowers slightly tinged with red, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous flowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this flower were semi-double, and by continued selection, in about nine or ten years, eight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of less than twenty years these double Scotch roses had so much increased in number and kind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties, classed in eight sections, were described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841 (10/182. 'An Encyclop. of Plants' by J.C. Loudon 1841 page 443.) {{it is said that}} three hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near Glasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, <b>red,</b> <b>marbled,</b> two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in {{the size and shape of}} the flower.|$|R
40|$|A further {{sale of the}} Pinelli library {{took place}} on 2 February 1790; its catalog was {{entitled}} "Bibliotheca Pinelliana. Appendix". The present catalog purports to be "an exact abridgment" of the six volume catalog by Jacopo Morelli published at Venice in 1787. The entire collection sold by Pinelli's heirs to the bookseller, James Edwards, did not, however, reach London. While in transit, on three vessels, one of the ships was captured by pirates and the books thrown into the sea. Edwards' present sale of the remainder brought £ 9, 000. cf. Ottino and Fumagalli, Bibliotheca bibliographica italica, no. 4180. The unnumbered section is a revised order of sale. ESTC (RLIN) Mode of access: Internet.
