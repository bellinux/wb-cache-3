5|$|Within a year, Wizards {{had sold}} {{millions}} <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the Pokémon game, {{and the company}} released a new set that included an instructional CD-ROM. Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003.

The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> Ashen {{were sent to}} various people.

Anderson was very happy with this, as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we prove the following: The semigroup {{which is a}} {{disjoint}} union <b>of</b> two or three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a group is a Clifford semigroup, Rees matrix semigroup or a combination between a Rees matrix semigroup and a group. Furthermore, the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> finitely many <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a finitely presented (residually finite) group is finitely presented (residually finite) semigroup. The constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup are parallel to the constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a group, i. e. such a semigroup is Clifford (strong semilattice of groups) or Rees matrix semigroup. However, the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup {{is not just a}} strong semillatice of semigroups, Rees matrix semigroup or combination between a Rees matrix semigroup and a semigroup, but there are two more semigroups which do not arise from the constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a group. We also classify semigroups which are disjoint unions <b>of</b> two or three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup. There are three types of semigroups which are unions <b>of</b> two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup and nine types of semigroups which are unions <b>of</b> three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup. For each type of such semigroups we exhibit a presentation defining semigroups of this type. The semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> finitely many <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup is finitely presented, residually finite, hopfian, has soluble word problem and has soluble subsemigroup membership problem...|$|R

5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, the number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a given allele {{can go up}} by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
