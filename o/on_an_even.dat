5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. <b>On</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as manager of}} Conference North club Alfreton Town on 25 May 2005 on a three-year contract, becoming the first full-time manager in the club's history. Alfreton went into 2005–06 with a reduced playing budget and Mills {{was able to keep}} the club <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel. His first match as Alfreton manager was a 2–1 home defeat to Vauxhall Motors on 13 August 2005, and having flirted with relegation the team finished the season in 17th place in the Conference North. Mills was registered as a player in 2005–06, and made 21 appearances after his debut came in a 2–1 home win over Redditch United on 10 September 2005.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more complex helicopter type.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} chronicle {{source is}} the material preserved in John of Fordun's Chronica gentis Scottorum ("Chronicle of the Scottish people") and Walter Bower's Scotichronicon. John of Fordun's work, which survives on its own, was {{incorporated in the}} following century into the work of Bower. Fordun's Chronica was written and compiled between 1384 and August 1387. Despite the apparently late date, Scottish textual historian Dauvit Broun has shown that Fordun's work in fact consists of two earlier pieces, Gesta Annalia I and Gesta Annalia II, the former written before April 1285 and covering the period from King Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III, died 1093) to 2 February 1285. Gesta Annalia I {{appears to have been}} based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> earlier text, about the descendants of Saint Margaret of Scotland, produced at Dunfermline Abbey. Thus material from these works concerning the late 12th- and early 13th-century Gall-Gaidhil may represent, despite the apparent late date, reliable contemporary or near-contemporary accounts.|$|E
5|$|Köln was {{the only}} ship of the class to survive the {{operations}} off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified {{to serve as a}} testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel, with her guns still above water, which permitted their use against advancing British forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel, with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 1314 December, Köln was {{attacked}} by British bombers in Oslofjord; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany. She departed Norway on 23 January 1945 in company with Admiral Hipper and a destroyer, and arrived in Kiel on 8 February. She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly. On 30 March, B-24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor; Köln was hit and sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel. Since her guns remained above water, the ship {{was used as an}} artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces. She served in this capacity {{until the end of the}} war in May. She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war, and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel to make it easier for her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

5|$|The three ships all {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1939. After the outbreak of war, {{they were used to}} lay defensive minefields along with Emden, and in April 1940, {{participated in the}} invasion of Norway. Two of the three cruisers, Karlsruhe and Königsberg, were sunk during the invasion; Karlsruhe was torpedoed by a British submarine off Kristiansand and Königsberg was sunk by British divebombers in Bergen. Köln was used in a variety of roles after the conclusion of the campaign, including as a testbed for operating the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter at sea. She was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, though she sank in shallow water <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel, which allowed her guns to provide gunfire support to German troops {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The war {{continued}} {{through the rest of}} 1675 and into the next year. The English were constantly frustrated by the Native Americans' refusal to meet them in pitched battle. They employed a form of guerilla warfare that confounded the English. Captain Benjamin Church continuously campaigned to enlist the help of friendly Native Americans to help learn how to fight <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> footing with Philip's warrior bands, but he was constantly rebuffed by the Plymouth leadership who mistrusted all Native Americans, thinking them potential enemies. Eventually, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military commander Major William Bradford (son of the late Governor William Bradford) relented and gave Church permission to organize a combined force of English and Native Americans. After securing the alliance of the Sakonnet, he led his combined force in pursuit of Philip, who had thus far avoided any major battles in the war that bears his name. Throughout July 1676, Church's band captured hundreds of Native American warriors, often without much of a fight, though Philip eluded him. Church was given permission to grant amnesty to any captured Native Americans who would agree to join the English side, and his force grew immensely. Philip was killed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war soon ended as an overwhelming English victory.|$|E

25|$|There {{may have}} been a third {{traditional}} church in Boho parish called Templemollem or the Church of the Mill, which is mentioned in the Survey of 1603 and in the Inquisition of 1609. This was the chapel of ease called Templemullin on a tate of land owned by the sept of the McGaraghan which had an annual tribute to pay to the former Lisgoole Abbey of five gallons of butter and one axe. It is also thought that the pre-reformation church in Toneel North {{may have been}} built <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> older a pre-Christian pagan amphitheatre.|$|E
25|$|Great Western was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, {{with four}} masts to hoist the {{auxiliary}} sails. The sails {{were not just}} to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American's British Queen went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson & Mercer in Bristol, Great Western was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons & Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting {{as a model for}} all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} Australian National Football Council (ANFC) was {{primarily}} to govern the game at a national level and to facilitate interstate representative and club competition. The ANFC ran the Championship of Australia, the first national club competition, which commenced in 1888 and saw clubs from different states compete <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> playing field. Although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time—South Australia and Victoria—and the majority of matches were played in Adelaide {{at the request of}} the SAFA/SAFL. The last match was played in 1976, with North Adelaide being the last non-Victorian winner in 1972. Between 1976 and 1987, the ANFC, and later the Australian Football Championships (AFC) ran a night series, which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in a knock-out tournament parallel to the premiership seasons, which Victorian sides still dominated.|$|E
25|$|Penry and Waldegrave then {{embarked}} <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> {{more controversial}} enterprise, the printing {{of the first}} four of the seven tracts written against the ecclesiastical authorities by an unknown satirist using the pseudonym Martin Marprelate. The first of the Marprelate tracts, Martin's Epistle, was printed at East Molesey in October 1588. It enjoyed immense popularity, and the ecclesiastical authorities instigated a hue and cry after Martin, {{as a result of}} which Penry moved the secret press to Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley in Northamptonshire, where Martin's second tract, The Epitome, was printed. Shortly thereafter the press was moved East Molesey to the Whitefriars, Coventry, the home of Knightley's great-nephew, John Hales, where Certain Mineral and Metaphysical Schoolpoints and Hay Any Work for Cooper were printed, the former in early January and the latter in late March 1589. Waldegrave then refused to print any further tracts, citing the Puritan ministers' disapproval of Martin Marprelate's course of action.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus {{it was impossible to}} lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
