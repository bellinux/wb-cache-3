25|$|The {{decline in}} {{advertising}} revenues affected both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many <b>online</b> <b>newspapers</b> and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of <b>online</b> <b>newspapers</b> may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E

25|$|Currency: Its {{information}} is as {{up to date}} as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper {{is limited by the}} need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate breaking news that has occurred since the morning edition was printed. <b>Online</b> <b>newspapers</b> can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.|$|E

25|$|Public accessibility: Its {{contents}} {{are reasonably}} {{accessible to the}} public, traditionally by the paper being sold or distributed at newsstands, shops and libraries, and, since the 1990s, made available over the Internet with online newspaper websites. While <b>online</b> <b>newspapers</b> have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., homeless people, impoverished people and people living in remote or rural regions {{may not be able}} to access the Internet, and thus will not be able to read online news). Literacy is also a factor which prevents people who cannot read from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).|$|E

2500|$|A {{new trend}} in {{newspaper}} publishing {{is the introduction}} of personalization through on-demand printing technologies or with online news aggregator websites like Google news. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications.

2500|$|Historically, {{publishing}} {{has been}} handled by publishers, {{with the history}} of self-publishing progressing slowly until the advent of computers brought us electronic publishing, which has been made evermore ubiquitous from the moment the world went online with the Internet. The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant medium of publishing, as websites are easily created by almost anyone with Internet access. The history of wikis started shortly thereafter, followed closely by the history of blogging. [...] Commercial publishing also progressed, as previously printed forms developed into online forms of publishing, distributing online books, <b>online</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and online magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{debate has}} become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 {{recession}} shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become {{an important source of}} revenue. At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of Millennials (young adults) get their news from social media websites such as Facebook. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering [...] "digital editions", which can be accessed via desktop computer, laptops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. <b>Online</b> <b>newspapers</b> may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as online advertising enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as Baby boomers and Millennials can be sent different advertisements.|$|E
