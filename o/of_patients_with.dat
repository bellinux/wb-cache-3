40|$|Serum a-fetoprotein {{levels were}} {{measured}} by a sensitive double-antibody radioimmunoassay in 580 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> a variety <b>of</b> malignant and nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases to determine the incidence of levels elevated above 40 ng/ml. Over 200 normal control subjects have all had levels below 40 ng/ml. Fifteen % <b>of</b> 95 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> gastric carcinoma, 3 % <b>of</b> 19 1 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> colorectal carcinoma, 24 % <b>of</b> 45 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic carcinoma, 25 % <b>of</b> 8 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> biliary tract carcinoma, and 70 % <b>of</b> 73 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> hepatocellular carcinoma had elevated serum a-feto protein.

5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings.

5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy (TBNA) for the diagnosis of mediastinal involvement, we have prospectively examined 316 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> morphologically verified bronchogenic carcinoma. The percentage of positive aspirations (149 of 316) from the three basic lymph node groups in the mediastinum was not significantly different. Tumor cells were aspirated from the mediastinum in 75 <b>of</b> 112 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> radiologically positive findings and in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> 74 <b>of</b> 204 radiologically negative findings. Mediastinal involvement was verified even in 61 <b>of</b> 196 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> a normal endoscopic picture. Metastases were proved in 14 <b>of</b> 39 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> peripheral versus 135 <b>of</b> 277 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> central carcinoma.

40|$|Background: In {{differentiated}} thyroid cancer (DTC) {{patients at}} intermediate risk of recurrences, no evidences are provided regarding the optimal radioactive iodine (RAI) activity {{to be administered}} for post-surgical thyroid ablation. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RAI activities on the outcome <b>of</b> 225 DTC <b>patients</b> classified as intermediate risk, treated with low (1110 - 1850 MBq) or high RAI activities (R 3700 MBq). Results: Six to 18 months after ablation, remission was observed in 60. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 60. 0 % of those treated with high RAI activities, biochemical disease was found in 18. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 14. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities, metastatic disease was found in 21. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 25. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities (PZ 0. 56). At the last follow-up (low activities, median 4. 2 years; high activities, median 6. 9 years), remission was observed in 76. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 72. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities, persistent disease was observed in 18. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 23. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities, recurrent disease was 2. 4 % in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and 2. 1 % in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities, deaths occurred in 2. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> low and in 2. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> high RAI activities (PZ 0. 87).
