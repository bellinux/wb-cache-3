[...] In addition to the military personnel, there was a civilian contractor who drove the <b>open</b> <b>wagon.</b> [...] The two non-commissioned officers leading the escort were armed with revolvers while the privates carried single shot rifles and carbines. [...] Wham and the civilian members of the convoy were unarmed. Accompanying Wham on the journey was a black woman, Frankie Campbell (also known as Frankie Stratton). [...] Campbell was the wife of a soldier stationed at Fort Grant and was going to collect gambling debts owed to her and her husband by soldiers stationed at Fort Thomas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{civilian}} {{driving the}} <b>open</b> <b>wagon</b> abandoned his vehicle as the gunfight began, fleeing to safety.

[...] The bandits called Campbell's name and fired a couple shots in her direction before turning their attention elsewhere. [...] Campbell then crawled behind a bush and some rocks located about [...] past the ambulance. [...] She observed the rest of the fight from this position.|$|E
2500|$|In medieval England as well, those {{convicted of}} high treason were paraded {{through the streets}} in an <b>open</b> <b>wagon</b> to their executions. Originally they had been dragged by horses, but some arrived almost dead from that treatment, unable to live through the hanging, castration, disemboweling and drawing and {{quartering}} that followed. While being transported, they were often pelted with objects thrown at them by onlookers. [...] "This was a symbolic process that led the criminal to oblivion," [...] observed Charles Spencer in Killers of the King, his 2014 account of the regicides of Charles I, {{many of whom were}} executed this way. [...] "The drawing through the streets provided a final, degrading journey from the living world." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is a Grade II listed building. St John's in Windle Royd Lane, Warley, Halifax, was {{designed}} by Barber and built between 1877 and 1878. This was a replacement for a wooden church built in 1856 in Windle Royd Lane further uphill. It {{was designed}} in Gothic Revival style for a congregation of 320–342, built {{at a cost of}} £3,930–4,000 with a church grant of £240 and consecrated in 1878. The building was planned as a nave and chancel, with everything else to the south: the nave aisle, tower, vestry and organ chamber. It is built of locally quarried sandstone with grey freestone dressings. The tower, notable for its large pinnacles, is attached to the north-west corner of the nave, with a square turret housing a spiral tower staircase to the bell-ringers' chamber only, this turret being tucked between the spire and the nave. The tower's ground floor is the church entrance, and the clock mechanism and clock faces between the ringers' chamber and the belfry were added in 1905. The chancel has an <b>open</b> <b>wagon</b> roof and the nave has closely spaced rafters. Due to the 2005 interior re-ordering, there is little left of Barber's designed and commissioned furnishings, but his floors may still exist, concealed beneath carpeting. There is an octagonal font and a round stone pulpit with [...] "open arcading and fleurons" [...] which may possibly be to his original 1877 design. The reason for listing is given as the exterior architecture by Barber as a local architect, and the church's position in the landscape.|$|E

60|$|AFTER the {{departure}} of Dene and his comrades Naab decided to leave White Sage at nightfall. Martin Cole and the Bishop's sons tried {{to persuade him to}} remain, urging that the trouble sure to come could be more safely met in the village. Naab, however, was obdurate, unreasonably so, Cole said, unless there were some good reason why he wished to strike the trail in the night. When twilight closed in Naab had his teams ready and the women shut in the canvas-covered wagons. Hare was to ride in an <b>open</b> <b>wagon,</b> one that Naab had left at White Sage to be loaded with grain. When it grew so dark that objects were scarcely discernible a man vaulted the cottage fence.|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} walked {{to where the}} biplane had been put together, in a large <b>open</b> <b>wagon</b> shed {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} the big barn. The biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet, and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it. There was a rudder in front and another behind, and in the centre was a broad cane seat, with a steering wheel, and several levers for controlling the craft. Back of the seat was the engine, lightly built but powerful, and above was a good-sized tank of gasoline. The framework of the biplane was of bamboo, held together by stays of piano wire, and the planes themselves were of canvas, especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite air proof. All told, the machine was a fine one, thoroughly up-to-date, and had cost considerable money.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{there came a}} fresh bevy of students onward from Williamstown; but they made only a transient visit, though it was still raining. These were a rough-hewn, heavy set of fellows, from the hills and woods in this neighborhood,--great unpolished bumpkins, {{who had grown up}} farmer-boys, and had little of the literary man, save green spectacles and black broadcloth (which all of them had not), talking with a broad accent, and laughing clown-like, while sheepishness overspread all, together with a vanity at being students. One of the party was six feet seven inches high, and all his herculean dimensions were in proportion; his features, too, were cast in a mould suitable to his stature. This giant was not ill-looking, but of a rattier intelligent aspect. His motions were devoid of grace, but yet had a rough freedom, appropriate enough to such a figure. These fellows stayed awhile, talked uncouthly about college matters, and started in the great <b>open</b> <b>wagon</b> which had brought them and their luggage hither. We had a fire in the bar-room almost all day,--a great, blazing fire,--and it was pleasant to have this day of bleak November weather, and cheerful fireside talk, and wet garments smoking in the fireside heat, still in the summer-time. Thus the day wore on with a sort of heavy, lazy pleasantness; and night set in, still stormy.|$|E

Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, <b>open</b> and flat <b>wagons,</b> and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|R
