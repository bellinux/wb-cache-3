5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

50|$|After the {{exhaustive}} Penal Code {{review in}} 2007, <b>oral</b> and anal <b>sex</b> were legalised for heterosexuals and female homosexuals only. The changes meant that <b>oral</b> and anal <b>sex</b> between consenting heterosexual and female homosexual adults {{were no longer}} offences but section 377A, which dealt with gross indecency between consenting men, remained in force. Kumaralingam Amirthalingam, a Professor of Law at the National University of Singapore, has argued {{that it may not}} apply to anal sex between males.|$|R
50|$|Transmission can {{be reduced}} by the usage of latex barriers, such as condoms or dental dams, during intercourse, <b>oral</b> and anal <b>sex,</b> and by {{limiting}} sexual partners.|$|R
5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|An episode {{featuring}} a storyline about a school shooting garnered the series {{an all-time high}} audience of 930,000 Canadian viewers. A second episode with a storyline about <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> also earned just under 1,000,000 viewers. Overall, the season averaged an audience of 600,000 and was the top domestic drama for Canadian teenagers aged 12 to 17, and adults in three age brackets; ages 18 to 34, ages 18 to 49, and ages 25 to 54. In the US, the season received an 80% larger audience compared to season three, and one episode received 540,000 viewers and drew a Nielsen rating of 2.7 for teenagers and 4.7 for female teenagers, meaning that on average 2.7% of the nation's teenagers, and 4.7% of the nation's female teenagers were tuned in at any given moment.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and <b>oral</b> <b>sex),</b> contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) {{began to work}} against police {{persecution}} of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. <b>Oral</b> <b>sex</b> was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a sex offender.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 2013, media {{reported}} that Apple Inc. had prohibited {{the sale of}} issue 12 of Saga through iOS, because two panels that depicted <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> between men in a small, in-set image violated Apple's restrictions on sexual content. This resulted in criticism by artists and writers, who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes. William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex. A day later, digital distributor Comixology announced {{that it had been}} they, not Apple, who had chosen not to make the issue available based on their interpretation of Apple's rules, and that after receiving clarification from Apple, the issue would now be sold via iOS.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2008, the Argentine journal Clarín {{reported}} about telephone wiretap records authorized for an anti-corruption investigation. Reporter Julio Algañaraz {{wrote that}} Carfagna and Silvio Berlusconi {{engaged in a}} telephone conversation with explicit allusions to <b>oral</b> <b>sex.</b> The wiretap transcripts have not been published, but the Italian newspaper La Repubblica interviewed the former vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and socialist executive Margherita Boniver, who admitted the existence of some messages. She later apologized to Mara Carfagna and the case was closed. Carfagna has instead sued for libel newspapers which had mentioned the alleged conversations and had shown some offensive statements. Following the reports, October 9, 2012 the Civil Court of Rome condemned Sabina Guzzanti to compensation of 40,000 euro to the former minister, ensuring, as all authorities, that those conversations never existed.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} trophic ecology of Saccodon dariensis in the Peñoles and El Cardal streams, Guatape River mid-basin, Magdalena River Basin, Colombia. Materials and methods. To compare {{differences}} in size between {{individuals from the}} two streams in terms of hydrologic periods, <b>oral</b> polymorphisms or <b>sexes,</b> {{an analysis of variance}} was conducted (ANOVA). Volume percentages, frequency of occurrence and the food importance index (FII) were determined; a principal component analysis (PCA) and an ANOVA was carried out to determine the diet differences between streams, climatic periods, <b>oral</b> polymorphism, <b>sexes</b> and developmental states, as well as a Mann-Whitney pairwise comparison test for each food category. Results. A significant difference was found in size between individuals of the two streams with different oral polymorphism. Algae are the most important food item (FII: 91. 9 %), followed by Trichoptera and insect remains (FII: 4. 3 %), and vegetal material (FII: 1. 8 %). The PCA did not indicate significant differences in diet between streams, climatic periods, <b>oral</b> polymorphisms, <b>sexes</b> or developmental states, but the ANOVA and Mann-Whitney pairwise comparison test indicated differences in oral morphotype, where individuals with a straight mouth consumed more vegetal material. We also observed different proportions in consumption of different algae genera, and increased consumption of insects in ontogeny, this being higher in individuals with a straight mouth. Conclusions. The species is algaevorous. The oral morphotypes of S. dariensis may be related to a trophic polymorphism that confers different trophic habits and differential access to the items that constitute their diet...|$|R
5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis {{and his love}} of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual <b>oral</b> <b>sex.</b> The deductions of this book, and similar application of psychoanalysis {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E
5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and <b>oral</b> <b>sex.</b> Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
50|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) may donate blood if they have not engaged in <b>oral</b> or anal <b>sex</b> with another man at least 12 months prior to a donation. This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017.|$|R
25|$|In the U.S., {{among men}} aged 15 to 44, an {{estimated}} 6% {{have engaged in}} <b>oral</b> or anal <b>sex</b> with another man {{at some point in}} their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male sexual partner in the previous 12 months.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, both {{heterosexual}} and homosexual <b>oral</b> and anal <b>sex</b> were criminal offences. In {{this particular}} narrow sense, Section 377 did not discriminate against homosexuals. However, early cases tried in India mainly involved forced fellatio with unwilling male children and one unusual case {{of sexual intercourse}} with the nostril of a buffalo.|$|R
5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z {{sitting on a}} chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At {{the end of the}} chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>sex,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as oral intercourse, is sexual activity involving the stimulation of the genitalia of a person by another person using the mouth (including the lips, tongue or teeth) or throat. Cunnilingus is <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> performed on a female, while fellatio is <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> performed on a male. Anilingus, another form of <b>oral</b> <b>sex,</b> is oral stimulation of a person's anus. Oral stimulation of {{other parts of the body}} (as in kissing and licking) is usually not considered <b>oral</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>sex</b> is not {{necessarily}} an effective method of preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although some forms of STIs {{are believed to be}} less commonly spread in this way, and <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> has been recommended as a form of safe sex. In the United States, no barrier methods for use during <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> have been evaluated as effective by the Food and Drug Administration. However, a barrier protection like a condom for fellatio or dental dam for cunnilingus can offer some protection from contact when practicing <b>oral</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>sex</b> {{is often}} {{regarded}} as taboo, but most countries {{do not have}} laws which ban the practice. Commonly, people do not regard <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary. People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving <b>oral</b> <b>sex,</b> or may flatly refuse {{to engage in the}} practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>sex</b> may be {{performed}} as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as vaginal or anal intercourse), {{or as an}} erotic and physically intimate act in its own right. Like most forms of sexual activity, <b>oral</b> <b>sex</b> can pose a risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission risk for <b>oral</b> <b>sex,</b> especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex.|$|E
