40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the crystal growth of strontium phosphates via different methods due to the bioactivity and biocompatibility of these materials with bone tissue. Here, we use a biomimetic method to synthesize strontium hydrogen phosphate/gelatin composites via single diffusion in gelatin. We compare the composite crystals with analytical-grade strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> using infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction. The IR spectra reveal that gelatin is incorporated into strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystals due to CH 2 and amide I vibrations. The SEM data exhibit arrow-like crystals and microspheres of strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> with bundled nano-flakes and flower-like surface arrangements of crystals. Furthermore, we find that the thermal stability of the strontium hydrogen phosphate/gelatin composite crystals is higher than that of the analytical-grade strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The ion concentration and the preparation method had only a small influence on the broadening of the X-ray Bragg reflections. Our study confirms that gelatin is a useful hydrogel for studying the crystallization of strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate...</b>|$|R

40|$|In rats kept on a low-potassium {{diet that}} {{contains}} only maintenance levels of magnesium, cardiac necroses and muscular cramps were readily {{induced by the}} oral administration of sodium perchlorate or disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The precipitation of these cardiac and skeletal muscle changes by sodium chlorate was prevented by the prophylactic administration of either potassium or magnesium chlorides. The protective effect of these chlorides against the cardiotoxic and convulsive effects of disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> has already been demonstrated by our earlier experiments. Sodium sulphate produced cardiac necroses in rats maintained on the same diet, and both potassium and magnesium chlorides had a prophylactic action. Unlike sodium perchlorate, however, sodium sulphate produced no muscular cramps under these conditions. Equimolecular amounts of sodium given {{in the form of}} sodium chloride (instead of sodium perchlorate, sodium sulphate, or disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate)</b> did not cause cardiac necroses or muscular cramps in rats maintained on the potassium-deficient diet. As the same three sodium salts, namely the perchlorate, the sulphate, and the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate,</b> produced cardiac necroses in rats sensitized by either a potassium-deficient diet or by certain corticoids, it seems that the anion must play a decisive rôle, since equivalent amounts of NaCl are ineffective...|$|R

50|$|When the {{nitric acid}} {{concentration}} is high the extraction into the organic phase is favoured, {{and when the}} nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the organic phase is stripped of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after {{the removal of the}} insoluble matter the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded organic phase to create a medium active liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This medium active aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new organic phase, the metal bearing organic phase is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium.
