On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill.

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> {{the tournament}} Paris Saint-Germain beat Valencia by three goals. The French club had made five {{changes to the}} side that lost against Arsenal, which worked to their favour as Amara Diané and David N'Gog each scored inside 30 minutes. Valencia {{struggled}} to match their opponents' intensity, though remained a threat with Fernando Morientes' arrival in the second half. The match was settled with five minutes remaining of normal time; Luyindula, on as a substitute, received a pass from Loris Arnaud which drew goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand out of his area and allowed the French striker to tap the ball into an empty net.|$|E

5|$|At Hinata House, Keitarō meets Naru Narusegawa, {{who is also}} {{studying}} to enter Tokyo University. Naru ranks first {{in the whole of}} Japan on the practice exams, and Keitarō convinces her to help him study. As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lindwall and his {{elder brother}} Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the First Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series. The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the {{captaincy}} of Douglas Jardine. Larwood, a small man like Lindwall, was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling, aiming short pitched bouncers at their upper body. Larwood also had a smooth, rhythmic run-up and a classical side-on action, something for which Lindwall became famous. The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe's much-celebrated 187 not out, aggressively resisting the Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified {{in terms of the}} greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 the {{legislature}} met from December 7 to 28 at the Methodist Church in Oregon City. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> this meeting at Main and Seventh streets, {{news of the}} Whitman massacre, which occurred on November 29, 1847, was delivered to {{the legislature}} by Governor Abernethy. This event would dominate {{the remainder of the}} session as the Provisional Government worked with the Hudson's Bay Company to send an army east to Walla Walla. Forty-two men under the command of Henry A. G. Lee were sent immediately to The Dalles in what {{was the beginning of the}} Cayuse War. A large force under the command of Cornelius Gilliam was then organized and sent to punish those responsible for the massacre. On December 23, the group created Benton District out of the southern section of Polk District, naming the new district for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton. In the legislature, Robert Newell was chosen as the speaker of the group with Calvin W. Cook as clerk.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
5|$|Lützow claimed nine aerial {{victories}} {{in his first}} week on the Eastern Front. The first victory, an I-18 fighter, {{a variant of the}} Polikarpov I-16, was achieved on the opening day of Barbarossa. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Barbarossa, he accounted for two Tupolev SB-2 bombers.

On 15 July he shot down two further I-16s and another DB-3 taking his total to 36 World War II victories.|$|E
