5|$|The brown roll-rim was {{described}} by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1785 as Agaricus contiguus, although the 1786 combination Agaricus involutus of August Batsch is taken as the first valid description. James Bolton published a description <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Agaricus adscendibus in 1788; the taxonomical authority Index Fungorum considers this to be synonymous with P.involutus. Additional synonyms include Omphalia involuta described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, and Rhymovis involuta, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844. The species gained its current binomial name in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries erected the genus Paxillus, and set it as the type species. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. It was thus written Paxillus involutus (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum. Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, William John Macquorn Rankine {{started to}} make use in {{calculation}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> his thermodynamic function.

25|$|Jung left no posthumous {{instructions}} {{about the}} final disposition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the Liber Novus or the Red Book. Sonu Shamdasani, an historian of psychology from London, tried {{for three years}} to persuade Jung's resistant heirs to have it published. Up to mid-September 2008, fewer than two dozen people had seen it. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it to raise the additional funds needed when the Philemon Foundation was founded.|$|E
25|$|In his {{adolescence}} Dixon {{helped out}} on the family farms, an experience that he hated, but that he later would say helped him {{to relate to the}} plight of the working man. Dixon grew up during Reconstruction following the Civil War. The government confiscation of farm land, the corruption of local politicians, and particularly the vengefulness of Federal troops coupled with the general lawlessness of the time all helped to shape young Dixon into a staunch opponent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> one of history's greatest tragedies.|$|E

Most of his votes he gained in Lviv oblast, Ternopil oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk oblast accounted to 5% of the vote. In the second round, Tyahnybok did not endorse a candidate. He did present a list of some 20 demands for second round candidate Yulia Tymoshenko had to fulfil first before gaining his endorsement—which included publicizing alleged secret deals Tymoshenko had with Vladimir Putin and ridding herself <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Ukraine-haters in her close circles.|$|E
25|$|While {{alternative}} versions {{had been}} developed before him, by Eduard Jäger von Jaxtthal and others, Snellen developed his eponymous eye chart in 1862 to measure visual acuity, which rapidly become the global standard. The most significant innovation was his use <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> optotypes, specially designed characters generated on a 5x5 grid, rather than using standard fonts. They provide a physical standard measure {{that could be used}} when printing the chart. Standard vision was measured as the ability to correctly read a line of optotype characters when they subtended 5 minutes of arc and were separated by 1 minute of arc.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1815, 14-year-old Pinkney joined the United States Navy as a {{midshipman}} until 1824, during which time he traveled to Italy, northern Africa, the West Indies, and both coasts of South America. His defiance <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> arbitrary authority got him in trouble occasionally. In 1824, {{two years after the}} death of his father, he left the Navy, married, and was admitted to the bar in Maryland. Though he was well respected in his abilities as a lawyer, he had few clients and the business failed. His wife, Georgiana McCausland, would become a supportive and inspirational figure to him.|$|E

25|$|The second {{event was}} being present {{to witness the}} terrible Johnstown Flood of 1889. Johnson and his {{business}} partner Arthur Moxham organized the immediate relief activities in the stricken, leaderless city. Interpreting the events through a Georgist lens, the experience {{left him with a}} deep resentment <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> 'Privilege'. The disaster had been caused by the improper maintenance of a dam holding a private recreational lake, owned by Henry Clay Frick and other Pittsburgh industrialists, who escaped all responsibility for it. More than that, to Johnson, the flood exemplified the inadequacy of charity and weak 'remedial measures' to solve society's problems.|$|E
25|$|When the new Congress {{convened in}} 1935, {{there were only}} twenty-five Republican senators, and Vandenberg {{was one of the}} most {{effective}} opponents of the second New Deal. He voted against most Roosevelt-sponsored measures, notable exceptions being the Banking Act of 1935 and the Social Security Act. He pursued a policy <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, states' rights, and reduced taxation. He felt that Franklin Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, and he spoke of the dictatorship of Roosevelt. But at the 1936 Republican National Convention, Vandenberg refused to permit the party to nominate him for Vice President, anticipating Roosevelt's victory that year.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
