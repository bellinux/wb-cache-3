5|$|The tablets {{constitute}} one of {{the oldest}} archives and libraries ever found; there is tangible evidence of their arrangement and even classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored <b>on</b> <b>shelves,</b> but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of the fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves; they found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.|$|E
5|$|Escape From Butcher Bay {{received}} critical acclaim. Certain reviewers {{preferred the}} game over its film counterpart, and considered it {{an exception to}} the general mediocrity of film tie-in games. The Xbox version of the game sold 159,000 copies in August 2004, and was among the best-selling games on any platform during June 2004; it was later re-released as a Platinum Hits title. Conversely, the PC version sold 32,500 after six months <b>on</b> <b>shelves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronica outsold Shenmue (1999) {{within its}} first week <b>on</b> <b>shelves</b> in February 2000. In total, the Dreamcast version sold almost 450,000 {{units in the}} United States and 1.14 million copies worldwide. The sales were weak {{compared}} to series predecessors, but strong compared to other Dreamcast games. The PlayStation 2 version of Code: Veronica X had sold 900,000 copies and earned $27 million in the United States by July 2006, outselling Resident Evil 4. It went on to sell 1.4 million copies worldwide. Next Generation ranked it as the 63rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of Resident Evil games released in the 2000s reached 3 million units in the United States by July 2006.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{was able}} to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, a lower price point, and a larger library of games when {{compared}} to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. ASCII Entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles. The NES was still the leader, with 300 titles and 100 <b>on</b> <b>shelves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment {{released}} a 3-disc Blu-ray combo pack (which includes the Blu-ray, DVD and a digital copy), 1-disc Blu-ray and 1-disc DVD on June 1, 2010 in the US and July 1, 2010 in Australia. The DVD release includes three short features about {{the making of}} the film, focusing on Burton's vision for Wonderland and the characters of Alice and the Mad Hatter. The Blu-ray version has nine additional featurettes centered on additional characters, special effects and other aspects of the film's production. In some confusion, a small number of copies were put <b>on</b> <b>shelves</b> a week before schedule in smaller stores, but were quickly removed, although a handful of copies were confirmed purchased ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products <b>on</b> <b>shelves,</b> each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

50|$|Foredge {{shelving}} (or fore-edge shelving) {{is a book}} shelving technique. Books {{are typically}} shelved upright with the spines facing outwards. However, when a book is too tall to stand upright <b>on</b> a <b>shelf</b> it may be shelved horizontally, i.e., flat, or with the spine resting <b>on</b> the <b>shelf</b> (spine shelving), or alternatively with the foredge, i.e., {{the part of the}} book opposite the spine, resting <b>on</b> the <b>shelf,</b> (foredge shelving).|$|R
25|$|In most of {{continental}} Europe and Latin America, {{titles are}} conventionally printed bottom-to-top on the spine so, when {{the books are}} placed vertically <b>on</b> <b>shelves,</b> the title can be read by tilting the head to the left.

Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.|$|E
