5|$|Due to the Parisian uprisings {{during the}} Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court {{to a new}} palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and {{sciences}} in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate {{that the city was}} safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards <b>of</b> <b>today.</b> Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.|$|E
5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} {{something like}} a tree shrew. Due to their nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, and greatly improved their sense of hearing. All mammals <b>of</b> <b>today</b> are shaped by this origin. Primates later re-evolved color-vision.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that <b>of</b> <b>today.</b> The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish <b>of</b> <b>today.</b> The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E

5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps <b>of</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs <b>of</b> <b>today.</b> This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most {{closely related to the}} slender lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises <b>of</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape.
