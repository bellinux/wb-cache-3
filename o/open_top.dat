5|$|Lothian Buses have {{operated}} city tours using white liveried coaches. Later, Leyland Atlanteans {{were employed in}} this same livery, with blinds for City Tour. These wore {{an updated version of}} the white livery with blue detailing after a short period. An Edinburgh Classic Tour was set up in 1989 using <b>open</b> <b>top</b> Leyland Atlanteans, and later Leyland Olympians, which competed with Guide Friday. This was as a result of Guide Friday introducing competition on the city centre to Airport route. The buses wore a blue and white livery, each carrying a name e.g.Scottish Star, Lothian Star and Highland Star. Lothian Buses also operated <b>open</b> <b>top</b> tours in Oxford (in conjunction with local operator Tappins) and Cambridge under the Classic Tour identity.|$|E

The city also has about 100 restaurants and a similar number of pubs and bars. Several companies offer <b>open</b> <b>top</b> bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river.

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, <b>open</b> <b>top</b> container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
