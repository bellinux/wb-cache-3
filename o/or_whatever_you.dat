A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want to call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own.

[...] Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week.

In the article, the magazine credits the album with [...] "single-handedly changed the face of mainstream rock." [...] Property of Zack also gave the album a fifteenth anniversary feature, commenting, [...] "Enema of the State has become the single most important album in our overarching community since its release in 1999.

Record companies are still putting out compilations of Coltrane ballads called Coltrane for Lovers <b>or</b> <b>whatever.</b> <b>You</b> can poke fun at the idea, but if you ever listen to one, they're indescribably beautiful." [...] The recordings compiled for Coltrane for Lovers have endured a legacy as one of Coltrane's best performing and interpreting of ballads and standards.

500|$|On July 14, 1990, {{before the}} start of Favre's senior year at Southern Miss, he was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama.

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care.

500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want to call it was so fierce that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter.

500|$|According to Greg Kot, 808s & Heartbreak {{initiated}} the [...] "wave of inward-looking sensitivity" [...] and [...] ""-inspired rappers {{during the late}} 2000s: [...] " [...] presaged everything from the introspective hip-hop of Kid Cudi's [...] (2009) to the wispy crooning, plush keyboards and light mechanical beats of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and British dub-step balladeer James Blake." [...] Consequence of Sound credited it with shaping subsequent developments in [...] "indie R or electropop <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want to call it": [...] "808s is flooded with R and it digitizes the raw emotion and isolated feelings that [...] have carved their brands out of today." [...] Craig D. Linsey from The Village Voice wrote that the album's [...] "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." [...] Marcus Scott of GIANT said rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, citing West's introspective, emotional themes and synthpop/"Vangelis-inspired" [...] music as influences. In the opinion of Billboard senior editor Alex Gale, the album was [...] "the equivalent of (Bob) Dylan going electric, and you still hear that all the time, in hip-hop and outside of hip-hop." [...] Drake's 2009 mixtape So Far Gone received comparisons from critics to 808s & Heartbreak. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times cited 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he [...] "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as [...] "the most influential person" [...] in shaping his own sound. In 2014, Rolling Stone named 808s & Heartbreak one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time. On September 26, 2015, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May [...] "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want to call it.

[...] His comments, made in the run-up to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that Ramsey's comments were part of [...] "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." [...] Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what The American Prospect described as [...] "one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country", authorizing the state attorney general to designate [...] "Sharia organizations" [...] and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, but the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam. Hedy Weinburg of the American Civil Liberties Union's Tennessee branch views the controversy as part of a trend; she told The American Prospect that [...] "ou don't have to dig too deep to see and hear the very rampant xenophobia and anti-Muslim voices." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon.
