Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. <b>Other</b> <b>less</b> controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. <b>Other</b> <b>less</b> important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for <b>other</b> <b>less</b> well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
5|$|Malacostraca is {{the largest}} of the six classes of crustaceans, {{containing}} about 40,000 living species, divided among 16 orders. Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, woodlice, amphipods, mantis shrimp and many <b>other,</b> <b>less</b> familiar animals.

Fish found living near Lōʻihi include the Celebes {{monkfish}} (Sladenia remiger), {{and members of the}} Cutthroat eel family, Synaphobranchidae. Invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents, a bresiliid shrimp (Opaepele loihi) of the family Alvinocarididae (described in 1995), and a tube or pogonophoran worm. Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm, and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some <b>other</b> (<b>less)</b> noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>less</b> common {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E

5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each <b>other</b> <b>less</b> than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the <b>other,</b> <b>less</b> intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. <b>Other,</b> <b>less</b> common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E

The casemates were protected by 15cm (5.9in) vertically and 3.5cm (1.4in) on the roofs. The forward conning tower was protected by 35cm (14in), and the aft tower had 20cm (7.9in) of armor. The turrets had 23cm (9.1in) on the face, 18cm (7.1in) on the sides, and 9cm (3.5in) on the roofs. The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5cm (2.0in), as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes. The torpedo bulkhead was 3cm (1.2in) in <b>other,</b> <b>less</b> critical areas.

5|$|Variation exists within all {{populations of}} organisms. This occurs partly because random {{mutations}} {{arise in the}} genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout {{the lives of the}} individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with <b>other,</b> <b>less</b> successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves. Factors that affect reproductive success are also important, including sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars.

The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each <b>other.</b> <b>Less</b> extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
