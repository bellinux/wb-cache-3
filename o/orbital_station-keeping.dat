25|$|Launch is {{scheduled}} for spring 2019 on an Ariane 5 rocket.

40|$|A {{series of}} east/west and north/south station-keeping {{maneuvers}} were simulated for the KOREASAT spacecraft {{which has to}} be maintained within ± 0 °. 05 at the nominal longitude of 116 °E. Weekly and biweekly based station-keeping maneuver plannings were used, and weekend maneuvers were avoided. All of the station-keeping maneuver plannings and executions were performed using KOREASAT Mission Analysis Software on VAX/VMS operating system. Fourteen weeks station-keeping maneuvers were performed and various <b>station-keeping</b> <b>orbital</b> parameters were obtained...|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} libration {{point is}} Earth-Sun , and three heliophysics missions have been orbiting L1 since approximately 2000. Station-keeping propellant use {{can be quite}} low, facilitating missions that can potentially last decades should other spacecraft systems remain operational. The three spacecraft—Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Global Geoscience WIND satellite—each have annual station-keeping propellant requirements of approximately 1 m/s or less.Earth-Sun —approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the anti-sun direction—is another important Lagrangian point, and the ESA Herschel space observatory operated there in a Lissajous orbit during 2009-2013, at which time it ran out of coolant for the space telescope. Small <b>station-keeping</b> <b>orbital</b> maneuvers were executed approximately monthly to maintain the spacecraft in the station-keeping orbit.|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} discuss a {{solution}} to the growing demand for satellite telecommunication coverage in the high-latitude geographical regions (beyond N), where the signal from geostationary satellites is limited or unavailable. We focus on the dynamical issues associated to the design, the coverage, the maintenance and the disposal of a set of orbits selected for the purpose. Specifically, we identify a group of highly inclined, moderately eccentric geosynchronous orbits derived from the Tundra orbit (geosynchronous, eccentric and critically inclined). Continuous coverage can be guaranteed by a constellation of three satellites in equally spaced planes and suitably phased. By means of a high-precision model of the terrestrial gravity field and the relevant environmental perturbations, we study the evolution of these orbits. The effects of the different perturbations on the ground track (which is more important for coverage than the orbital elements themselves) are isolated and analyzed. The physical model and the numerical setup are optimized with respect to computing time and accuracy. We show that, {{in order to maintain the}} ground track unchanged, the key parameters are the orbital period and the argument of perigee. Furthermore, corrections to the right ascension of the ascending node are needed in order to preserve the relative orientation of the <b>orbital</b> planes. A <b>station-keeping</b> strategy that minimizes propellant consumption is then devised, and comparisons are made between the cost of a solution based on impulsive maneuvers and one with continuous thrust. Finally, the issue of end-of-life disposal is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Orbits around {{libration}} {{points are}} dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow exponentially over time. As a result, spacecraft in libration point orbits must use propulsion systems to perform <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is a {{satellite}} platform manufactured by Orbital Sciences Corporation with an apogee kick motor {{to place a}} communications satellite into geostationary orbit, a thruster to provide the satellite with <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping</b> for a 15-year mission, and solar arrays to provide the satellite payload with 5 kW of electrical power.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, any orbits around Lagrangian points , , or [...] are {{dynamically}} unstable, meaning small {{departures from}} equilibrium grow over time. As a result, spacecraft in these Lagrangian point orbits must use their propulsion systems to perform <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping.</b> Although {{they are not}} perfectly stable, a modest effort of station keeping keeps a spacecraft in a desired Lissajous orbit for a long time.|$|E
5000|$|Atmospheric drag exerts a {{significant}} effect at the altitudes of space stations, space shuttles and other manned Earth-orbit spacecraft, and satellites with relatively high [...] "low earth orbits" [...] such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Space stations typically require a regular altitude boost to counteract orbital decay (see also <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping).</b> Uncontrolled orbital decay brought down the Skylab space station, and (relatively) controlled orbital decay was used to de-orbit the Mir space station.|$|E
50|$|A space {{rendezvous}} is an orbital maneuver during which two spacecraft, {{one of which}} is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities and position vectors of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping.</b> Rendezvous {{may or may not be}} followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.|$|E

40|$|NASA's {{research}} in communications satellite technology is discussed, including orbit-efficient techniques and applications by the commercial sector. Attention {{is given to}} expanding the capacities of the C-band (6 - 4 GHz) and the Ku-band (14 - 11 GHz), opening the Ka-band (30 / 20 GHz), broadly applied 're-use' of the spectrum, and developing multibeam spacecraft antennas with on-board switching. Increasing wideband services in video, high-speed data, and voice trunking is considered, as are narrow-band systems {{that may be used}} for data collection or public safety, with possible expansion to a thin-route satellite system. In particular, communication for medical, disaster, or search-and-rescue emergencies may be met by the integration of a satellite service with land mobile communications via terrestrial radio links.

40|$|Libration point orbits are, in general, {{inherently}} unstable. Without {{the presence}} of corrective maneuvers a spacecraft will diverge from the vicinity of such trajectories. In this research effort, two orbital maintenance control strategies are studied: the impulsive Floquet Mode (FM) controller and the continuous Hamiltonian Structure-Preserving (HSP) controller. These two controllers are further developed to incorporate real-world mission design constraints. The FM controller is modified to accommodate feasible maneuver directions that are constrained to a plane or a line. This controller is shown to be applicable for <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping</b> of spin stabilized spacecraft that are only equipped with either tangential thrusters or axial thrusters. The HSP controller is extended for application to general three-dimensional hyperbolic libration point orbits, and then discretized {{to account for the}} minimum time required for orbit determination and/or scientific operations. Both controllers are applied to an unstable ? 1 halo orbit in the Sun-Earth/Moon system. The performances of these controllers are examined under the impacts of the spacecraft’s operation errors and mission design constraints. Simulation results suggest that the FM controller is capable of maintaining the motion of the spacecraft {{in the vicinity of the}} desired reference trajectory for the duration of the simulation, while satisfying all mission design constraints. The discrete-time MHSP controller proves to be able to improve the stability of the nominal trajectory by reducing the value of the unstable Poincare exponent of the reference orbit. ...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{thrusters}} {{have been}} used for many years for <b>orbital</b> <b>station-keeping</b> and propulsion. As technology advances, smaller satellites are possible that require less thrust. The resulting miniature electric thrusters need low-weight and compact designs. This thesis specifies the design, fabrication, and testing of a thruster and its fluid delivery system designed for use with a micro-satellite weighing less than fifty kilograms. The advent of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) has sparked a new market with incredibly small scale designs. Using this technology with Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) materials has spawned the new distinction of Ceramic Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (C-MEMS). The thruster body is made entirely out of LTCC and it has embedded electrical connections and gas delivery channels integrated wholly within the thruster. These thrusters are tested inside a vacuum chamber system set up at Boise State University to simulate the pressure ranges seen in typical space applications. Plasma generation requires adequate gas pressures localized to the time-varying electric field inside of a vacuum. Prior testing for prototype thrusters at Boise State University proved that a single hole central gas injection point was not taking full advantage of the locations of high electric field intensity. This was the driving force to generate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the pressure ranges as they applied to the areas of high electric field intensity. ANSYS Fluent was used as the modeling software to simulate the pressure ranges of the gas seen inside the thruster body. Experimental testing was done to verify the validity of the Fluent modeling. Electric field intensity was used as a driving force for the design of the gas outlets and their locations. The resulting thruster design demonstrated the successful ability to use LTCC as a substrate for a miniature thruster with fully embedded electrical components and gas channels. Experimental testing showed that a multiple hole gas injection concept created a higher localized pressure within the thruster cylinder, which increases plasma efficiency. The increase in localized pressure was as high as 49. 8 % larger than a single injection hole design. The experimental tests were also used as a method of validation for a CFD model {{that could be used in}} future iterations of the thruster to improve the locations of the thruster gas injection holes. Further work should be done with the external connections to the LTCC body to improve long-term durability. These results imply that LTCC is a viable medium for creating miniature thrusters for micro-satellites. The LTCC creates a hermetically sealed fluidic pathway for neutral gas to travel through, which reduces the size of the overall thruster considerably. A thruster made out of LTCC is both small in size and has excellent qualities to survive the harsh environment of space...|$|E
