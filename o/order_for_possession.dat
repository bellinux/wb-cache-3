50|$|The 'commonplace, indeed routine' {{facts were}} that Mrs Adeline Agnew twice failed to {{complete}} purchase of Michael and Renee Johnson's farm, Scheepcote Grange, Woodburn Common, Buckinghamshire. She had contracted {{to buy the}} farm on 1 November 1973 for £117,000. When everything was ready in December and January 1974, she did nothing. Meanwhile, the Johnsons were in financial trouble. They were in arrears on mortgage repayments. In March 1974 they claimed specific performance of the contract, and won summary judgment in June, but the order was not drawn up until November, and so the Johnsons left it, because in the meantime, the mortgagees had won <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> and sale of the property. The Johnsons' lawyer advised {{there was no point}} enforcing against Agnew. The mortgagees only realised £48,000, not even enough to discharge the Johnsons' mortgage debts. The Johnsons' creditors filed them into bankruptcy. This was adjourned, and the Johnsons' brought a claim against Agnew seeking the purchase price (less deposit and the £48,000 realised on sale by the mortgagees), and a declaration that the contract was repudiated and to keep the deposit price.|$|R

2500|$|A writ of {{assistance}} is a written order (a writ) issued {{by a court}} instructing a law enforcement official, such as a sheriff or a tax collector, to perform a certain task. Historically, several types of writs have been called [...] "writs {{of assistance}}". Most often, a writ of assistance is [...] "used to enforce an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> the <b>possession</b> of lands". When used to evict someone from real property, such a writ is also called a writ of restitution or a writ of possession. In the area of customs, writs of assistance were first authorized {{by an act of}} the English Parliament in 1660 (12 Charles 2 c. 29), and were issued by the Court of Exchequer to help customs officials search for smuggled goods. These writs were called [...] "writs of assistance" [...] because they called upon sheriffs, other officials, and loyal subjects to [...] "assist" [...] the customs official in carrying out his duties.|$|R

50|$|In United Kingdom, {{foreclosure}} is {{a little}} used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having no right to any surplus from the sale. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it. Instead, they usually grant an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> and an order for sale, which mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale.|$|E
50|$|Mortgage {{possession}} involves {{legal proceedings}} {{in which a}} mortgagee, or other lienholder, usually a lender, obtains a court <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of a property, prior to exercising the mortgagor's equitable right of redemption. Usually a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults the lender can possesses the property.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} regain possession, the {{landlord}} may {{do so only}} on {{one of a number}} of statutory grounds, which are set out in Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988. To obtain an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession,</b> the landlord must serve a section 8 notice on the tenant, setting out the ground or grounds that are relied on and then, after a period of time that varies depending on the grounds chosen, apply to the court for possession.|$|E
50|$|Mortgage {{possession}} {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with foreclosure. In the United Kingdom foreclosure is a little used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having no right to any surplus from the sale. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it. Instead, they will usually grant an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> and an order for sale, which mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale.|$|E
50|$|Note in the UK {{a lender}} can take {{possession}} of a person's home due to default on a mortgage. This process is incorrectly often known as mortgage repossession; however assets can only be repossessed if the lender was the seller, which {{is often the case}} with cars but not usually houses. The correct terminology is possession. The process typically involves obtaining firstly an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> in the courts, then an eviction warrant. The eviction is carried out by bailiffs. Once the lender has obtained possession, it can then sell the home to recoup any lost arrears.|$|E
50|$|A new {{mandatory}} ground <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> (Case 20) {{was introduced}} for lettings by servicemen.

50|$|The third mode {{of human}} {{evidence}} is possession, {{and it is}} considered a much surer means of proof than the other two. In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> to serve as adequate evidence, “it must be supported by a title, it must be of longstanding, uninterrupted, not claimed by others, and held {{in the presence of}} the other party.” If a title (property) accompanies the ownership, the possession and the title need to be produced simultaneously, and if there is no title, the possession needs to be of longstanding. Although texts disagree about how much time someone has to have possession of something before they have ownership of it, the general consensus seems to be three uninterrupted generations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{husband and}} wife, joint tenants, {{divorced}} and she issued a summons under the Married Women's Property Act 1882, section 17 {{for the house}} to be sold and proceeds split between them. She swore an affidavit saying she wanted proceeds to be ‘distributed equally; alternatively, that husband pay me one half the value ...’. An <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> and sale was made, but the husband could remain in possession until his death. He died before divorce proceedings were finished. The children of the husband wanted there to be severance so they could claim the father’s share, and not have her entitled to the whole. The question was whether a severance of the joint tenancy was effective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expression}} [...] "protected tenancy", {{first used}} in the Rent Act 1965, is an inclusive term which covered both [...] "controlled" [...] tenancies and [...] "regulated" [...] tenancies. Protected tenancies (which since 1980 can only be regulated tenancies) are currently governed by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Section 11 of that Act provides that there can only be an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> where the court is satisfied that {{it is reasonable to}} make the order and either suitable alternative accommodation is, or will be, available or one of the ten discretionary grounds specified in Part I of Schedule 2 is satisfied. Part II of the Schedule deals with the ten mandatory grounds which attract no test of reasonableness.|$|E

50|$|The Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act 1958 {{prohibited}} {{the recovery of}} possession except by legal proceedings of certain dwelling houses released from control by Section 11(1) of the Rent Act 1957. It also suspended for a limited period the execution of any order made for possession for those still remaining in their homes on 1 August 1958, by postponing the effect of any earlier <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession.</b> lt regulated the rent payable pending recovery of possession (to twice the 1956 gross value, plus rates, and for services and furniture unless the contractual rent previously payable was higher). It made it an offence to recover possession other than by proceedings in court and to withhold services or furniture to which the tenant was entitled.|$|E
50|$|These were {{introduced}} by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 and are now the only form of tenancy which can be provided for both the privately rented and housing association sectors. Section 18 of that Act provides that the landlord may obtain an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> only if he satisfies one of the grounds prescribed in Schedule 5. Part I of the Schedule lists the eight mandatory grounds and Part II details the nine discretionary grounds, with the latter grounds again being subject to the test of reasonableness. Schedule 5 is similar in style to Schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and to Schedule 3 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Many of the grounds of possession are clearly founded on traditional Rent Act precedents.|$|E
50|$|Secure Tenancies Prior to 1980 neither local {{authority}} nor housing association tenants had had {{any right to}} security of tenure since 1954 when the Rent Acts were disapplied to such tenants by, for Scotland, the Housing (Repairs and Rents) (Scotland) Act 1954. However, security of tenure was restored in Scotland to these categories of tenants by the Tenant's Rights Etc., (Scotland) Act 1980 which introduced secure tenancies {{as a form of}} tenure. The security of tenure provisions have now been consolidated into the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Sections 46 and 48 of that Act provide that an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> may be granted only on the grounds laid down in Schedule 3. Part I of the Schedule sets out the sixteen grounds, all of which are discretionary. There are no mandatory grounds as such.|$|E

Karpisek argued that the penalties <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of marijuana should at least equal those <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of alcohol by a minor. The bill passed the Legislature 40-2, and {{was signed into law}} by governor Heineman.|$|R
