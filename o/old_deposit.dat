6000|$|There {{are some}} other coasts on the map, where volcanoes {{in a state of}} action concur with proofs of recent elevation, besides those {{coloured}} red from being fringed by coral-reefs. Thus I hope to show in a future volume, that nearly the whole line of the west coast of South America, which forms the greatest volcanic chain in the world, from near the equator for a space of between 2,000 and 3,000 miles southward, has undergone an upward movement during a late geological period. The islands on the north-western shores of the Pacific, which form the second greatest volcanic chain, are very imperfectly known; but Luzon, in the Philippines, and the Loo Choo Islands, have been recently elevated; and at Kamtschatka (At Sedanka, in latitude 58 deg N. (Von Buch's [...] "Descrip. des Isles Canaries," [...] page 455). In a forthcoming part, I shall give the evidence referred to with respect to the elevation of New Zealand.) there are extensive tertiary beds of modern date. Evidence of the same nature, but not very satisfactory, may be detected in Northern New Zealand where there are two volcanoes. The co-existence {{in other parts of the}} world of active volcanoes, with upraised beds of a modern tertiary origin, will occur to every geologist. (During the subterranean disturbances which took place in Chile, in 1835, I have shown ("Geolog. Trans." [...] 2nd Ser., vol. v., page 606) that at the same moment that a large district was upraised, volcanic matter burst forth at widely separated points, through both new and old vents.) Nevertheless, until it could be shown that volcanoes were inactive, or did not exist in subsiding areas, the conclusion that their distribution depended on the nature of the subterranean movements in progress, would have been hazardous. But now, viewing the appended map, it may, I think, be considered as almost established, that volcanoes are often (not necessarily always) present in those areas where the subterranean motive power has lately forced, or is now forcing outwards, the crust of the earth, but that they are invariably absent in those, where the surface has lately subsided or is still subsiding. (We may infer from this rule, that in any <b>old</b> <b>deposit,</b> which contains interstratified beds of erupted matter, there was at the period, and in the area of its formation, a TENDENCY to an upward movement in the earth's surface, and certainly no movement of subsidence.) ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrothermal {{systems have}} been {{suggested}} as suitable environments for the appearance {{of life on the}} Early Earth and may provide habitats for microorganisms on Mars. The deposits created by these systems are preserved in the geological record. This research investigates the key mineralogical, textural and biological markers found in terrestrial hydrothermal deposits that can be used as analogues in the search for evidence of life on Mars. Samples of silica sinter from Iceland and New Zealand, the Rhynie Chert 396 Ma <b>old</b> <b>deposit</b> from Aberdeenshire and hydrothermally altered impactites from the Chicxulub impact crater have been analysed to understand the mineralogical properties unique to the different hydrothermal conditions and the evidence of extant or extinct microorganisms within them. Re-colonisation of basaltic substrates by hot spring-derived cultures was also carried out. This research was conducted using a multidisciplinary approach with the analytical techniques and instruments involved currently used for in-situ and orbital observations of planetary bodies. The principal techniques, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), were used due to their combined capabilities in the identification of a variety of rocks and minerals, and a wide range of organic compounds. This PhD research has shown that FTIR in particular is an exceptional analytical technique for use in astrobiological investigations. This research has characterised hydrothermal deposits of different ages and created by different processes on Earth to ascertain their potential for preserving organic compounds in similar deposits on Mars. Results indicate that siliceous hydrothermal deposits of recent and ancient formation yield biomolecular evidence for past and present microbial colonisation as do hydrothermally altered impact deposits and re-colonised basaltic substrates. The identification of mineralogical and biological information using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy has wide implications in the search for life on Mars and other planetary bodies.

This thesis is based on field study of this {{lower part of}} the Huqf Supergroup in the Jebel Akhdar and Huqf areas of Oman. The aim of the thesis is to provide a detailed sedimentological interpretation of this portion of the Oman stratigraphy, as well as analysing the implications of new chemostratigraphic and chronological data from Oman in a regional and global context. Volcanics and volcaniclastic deposits of the Halfayn Formation in the north of the Huqf area form the <b>oldest</b> <b>deposits</b> of the Huqf Supergroup. Previously, the Halfayn Formation has been correlated with volcanics that occur within the Abu Mahara Group of the Jebel Akhdar.
