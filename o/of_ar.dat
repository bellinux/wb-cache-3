40|$|Abstract. It is well-recognized {{that the}} main factor that hinders the {{applications}} <b>of</b> Association Rules (<b>ARs)</b> is the huge number <b>of</b> <b>ARs</b> re-turned by the mining process. In this paper, we propose an effective solution that presents concise mining results by eliminating the redun-dancy in the set <b>of</b> <b>ARs.</b> We adopt the concept of δ-Tolerance to define the set <b>of</b> δ-Tolerance <b>ARs</b> (δ-TARs), which is a concise representation for the set <b>of</b> <b>ARs.</b> δ-Tolerance is a relaxation on the closure defined on the support of frequent itemsets, thus allowing us to effectively prune the redundant ARs. We then devise a set of inference rules, with which we prove that the set of δ-TARs is a non-redundant representation <b>of</b> <b>ARs.</b> In addition, we prove that the set <b>of</b> <b>ARs</b> that {{is derived from the}} δ-TARs by the inference rules is sound and complete. We also develop a compact tree structure called the δ-TAR tree, which facilitates the efficient gener-ation of the δ-TARs and derivation <b>of</b> other <b>ARs.</b> Experimental results verify the efficiency of using the δ-TAR tree to generate the δ-TARs and to query the <b>ARs.</b> The set <b>of</b> δ-TARs is also shown to be drastically smaller than the state-of-the-art concise representations <b>of</b> <b>ARs...</b>|$|R

25|$|Small {{molecule}} antiandrogens {{that are}} available today have undesirable side effects caused by complete, non-selective inhibition <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> action. To minimize these side effects, {{a new class of}} tissue selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) has been proposed as a novel approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. These ligands should behave as antagonists in the prostate with either no activity or agonist activity in other target tissues, so as to have little or no effects in the anabolic tissues or central nervous system (CNS). However discovering this new class of ligands might be challenging because the molecular mechanism <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> action is not well understood.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 {{there were}} reports of a {{chlorinated}} peptide, sintokamide A, isolated from marine sponges that effectively inhibits AR N-terminal domain-activated reporter gene transcription, see figure 8. The evidence presented was not sufficient enough to support the conclusion that sintokamide A directly inhibits the function <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> NTD, and the mechanism of action needs further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to achieve this tissue selectivity <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> ligands. The most definitive evidence exists {{for the role of}} 5-alpha reductase. 5-alpha reductase is only expressed in specific tissues and could therefore be a unique contributor to tissue selectivity. Specific inhibition of the type 2 enzyme by finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT in the prostate.|$|E

25|$|Construction was precluded by {{a series}} of {{feasibility}} studies. In 1879, the first of five landings at the rock was carried out, during which currents and ease of docking at the site were assessed. Fishermen from the Île de Sein, begrudgingly or otherwise, successfully established the first mooring points. Six cubic metres of stonework were built for the base, with the help of stonemasons who had already worked on the lighthouse <b>of</b> <b>Ar</b> Men. This enabled the rock to be boarded from the north-east.|$|E

Among the numerous bands and artists which followed its genesis, are Xutos & Pontapés, GNR, Quinta do Bill, UHF, The Gift and Moonspell.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. The AR antagonistic (i.e., antiandrogen) activity of spironolactone was first discovered and reported in 1969, which shortly followed the discovery in 1968 that gynecomastia, a frequent {{and by that}} time well-established side effect of spironolactone, is an important and major side effect <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> antagonists. The drug started to be used as an antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of hirsutism in women, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town <b>of</b> <b>Ar</b> Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town <b>of</b> <b>Ar</b> Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south <b>of</b> <b>Ar</b> Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{established}} a few prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3 (PC3), and DU-145 (DU145) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express androgen receptor (AR); however, PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer. The proliferation of LNCaP cells is androgen-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is androgen-insensitive. Elevation <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> expression is often observed in advanced prostate tumors in patients. Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression. These androgen-independent LNCaP cells have elevated AR expression and express prostate specific antigen upon androgen treatment. The paradox is that androgens inhibit the proliferation of these androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.|$|E

Sify's critic stated that Murugadoss [...] "has made a complete entertainer that blends with Vijay's mass image, thanks to his racy script", calling it a [...] "perfect Diwali entertainer". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu commented: [...] "One of the first promos of the film, with snapshots of Mumbai, lurking terror, the antagonist threatening Vijay to which he responds 'I am waiting' went viral on social networks. The wait, clearly, has been worth it for the audience. And the man who's probably having the last laugh is Murugadoss". For the same newspaper, Karthik Subrmaniam wrote, [...] "One can only wonder just how much better Thuppakki would have been if it had done away with the song-and-dance-and-romance and such trappings." [...] Haricharan Pudipeddi of The New Indian Express said, [...] "Most of the characters are made to look dumb as Vijay steals all the attention. Kajal's role as a boxer, which she squanders with her cliched performance, is definitely a turn off in the film. Jayaram and Sathyan, who're supposed to make us laugh, fail miserably in the process" [...] and concluded, [...] "In essence, [...] "Thuppakki" [...] has the energy of Vijay and intellect <b>of</b> <b>A.R.</b> Murugadoss".|$|E
