40|$|Background/PurposeAcoustic {{analysis}} {{is often used}} in speech evaluation but seldom {{for the evaluation of}} oral prostheses designed for reconstruction of surgical defect. This study aimed to introduce the application of acoustic analysis for patients with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) due to oral surgery and rehabilitated with oral speech-aid prostheses. MethodsThe pre- and postprosthetic rehabilitation acoustic features of sustained vowel sounds from two patients with VPI were analyzed and compared with the acoustic analysis software Praat. ResultsThere were significant differences in the <b>octave</b> <b>spectrum</b> of sustained vowel speech sound between the pre- and postprosthetic rehabilitation. Acoustic measurements of sustained vowels for patients before and after prosthetic treatment showed no significant differences for all parameters of fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, formant frequency, F 1 bandwidth, and band energy difference. The decrease in objective nasality perceptions correlated very well with the decrease in dips of the spectra for the male patient with a higher speech bulb height. ConclusionAcoustic analysis may be a potential technique for evaluating the functions of oral speech-aid prostheses, which eliminates dysfunctions due to the surgical defect and contributes to a high percentage of intelligible speech. <b>Octave</b> <b>spectrum</b> analysis may also be a valuable tool for detecting changes in nasality characteristics of the voice during prosthetic treatment of VPI...|$|E

On a test field a choice of different structured road markings {{as well as a}} flat road marking were analyzed regarding the noise emission at different velocities of a passenger car. In a speed range from 30 to 120 km/h the controlled pass-by noise of the car was measured. Beside the A-weighted sound pressure level the third <b>octave</b> <b>spectrum</b> was calculated and the vertical directivity was analyzed. Against the background of these results the application area of the different structured road markings can be concretized in order that the positive photometric effects or the intended rumble can be used furthermore without annoying residents...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{an issue that}} arose {{in the implementation of}} graph sonification in an accessible mathematics product developed by the NASA Learning Technologies team at the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas. The software provides text descriptions and audible displays of 2 -dimensional graphs of equations, raw data, or simulations, and these audible displays make use of pitch to indicate the height component(s) of the curve. It is therefore important for us to provide the clearest possible pitch cue over a wide (4 <b>octave)</b> <b>spectrum.</b> One significant barrier to use of a relatively wide frequency range is the fact that pure tones are attenuated significantly in the lower frequencies by inexpensive sound systems common on personal computers. In this paper, we describe several approaches to the problem of choosing waveforms which clearly communicate pitch while remaining audible at low frequencies. We end by describing our compromise solution and by offering researchers an applet-based tool for further experimentation. 1...|$|E

In order to test the influence of microphone position (including the distance from façade) a computer model has been developed which includes noise reflection at neighbouring surfaces as well as vehicle trajectory and its associated Doppler spectral warping. Detailed FFT spectrum as well as octave and one third of an <b>octave</b> <b>spectra</b> have been computed for different microphone configurations.

The modules of the system utilized for main and tail rotor geometry and blade section aerodynamic characteristics, for analyses, and for source-to-observer geometry, and atmospheric and ground effects calculations are described; a diagram {{of the system is}} provided. The Rotonet system produces axial force, tone noise, and sound pressure level information and a one third <b>octave</b> <b>spectrum</b> related to rotor tone noise and broadband noise sources. Main rotor noise predictions are compared with flight data. It is observed that both sets of data reveal increase loading on the advancing side and decrease loading on the retreating side. The tone noise and sound pressure levels for the first and second harmonics correlate well with the flight data; however, there is only fair agreement for the third harmonics of the sound pressure level. Analysis of the spectra display lower noise levels for higher altitudes and lower speeds. It is noted that the baseline Rotonet system is applicable for predicting performance and noise signatures for the lower harmonics. A phase II Rotonet system for evaluating higher harmonics is being developed...|$|E

This paper compares the underwater noise generated during the piling activities of steel monopiles at the Belwind wind farm (Blighbank) with that of jacket pinpiles at the C-Power project (Thorntonbank). Underwater noise was measured at various distances from the pile driving location. The underwater noise was quantified by its zero to peak sound pressure level (), unweighted sound exposure level (SEL), cumulative SEL, and 1 / 3 <b>octave</b> <b>spectra.</b> No significant differences in could be demonstrated (monopile : 179 – 194 [*]dB[*]re 1 [*]μPa, jacket : 172 – 189 [*]dB[*]re 1 [*]μPa).

Properties of near-field jet noise, obtained in particular at 7. 5 diameters from the jet centerline, are documented. They differ appreciably from properties of far-field noise, and form a database {{that can be used}} for the validation of the acoustic fields determined by compressible Navier-Stokes computations. The near pressure fields originating from simulations can thus be directly compared, without resorting to extrapolation methods which might lead to uncertainties in the far pressure fields. In the present paper, sound source localizations are also carried out from the near-field pressure signals. The experiments provide in addition far-field results evaluated at 52 diameters from the nozzle exit, in good agreement with the data of the literature. The classical dependence of jet noise features with the emission angle is observed. The level and frequency scalings of the pressure spectra obtained for subsonic jets in the sideline and downstream directions are also studied. For small radiation angles, the narrow-banded sound spectra measured are found to scale as the Strouhal number, whereas, as previously noted by Zaman & Yu [1], the one-third <b>octave</b> <b>spectra</b> seem to scale as the Helmholtz number...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 {{a revised}} version of the German {{aircraft}} noise calculation procedure AzB was published. It provides a source model based on <b>octave</b> <b>spectra</b> and an explicit directivity description. This allows a flexible and extendable source description that is clearly separated from the sound propagation model. The AzB uses a segmentation technique similar to that described in the 3 rd edition of ECAC Doc. 29. However the model was developed to calculate noise zones based on forecasted air traffic scenarios – a use for bygone scenarios was not intended. This {{is reflected in the}} structure of the AzB database that consists only of a relative small number of aircraft categories which are representative for German airports. The source and propagation modelling described in ECAC Doc. 29 is not as flexible as the AzB approach. However Doc. 29 offers a much higher flexibility in flight performance modelling and takes advantage of the comprehensive and standardised international aircraft noise and performance database ANP. It was obvious to combine the best qualities of Doc. 29 and AzB to set up an aircraft noise calculation procedure that extends the current best practice and accounts for the experiences made during the last decade of aircraft noise modelling. This is the primary goal of the new German DIN 45689. The paper gives an overview on the current and planned work on this standard. ...|$|R
