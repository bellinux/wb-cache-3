40|$|A {{high-voltage}} generator PowerformerTM {{is a new}} generation of the AC generators. The most significant advantages of these PowerformerTM are their direct connection to high-voltage grid, higher availability, and more reactive power margin, short term <b>overloading</b> <b>capacity</b> and removing the power transformer from the structure of the power plant. In this paper, the installation effect of these generators on the power system reliability is investigated. The amount of the effects depends on the type and location of the power plant, location of the PowerformerTM, the size of load and network topology. For this purpose, in the 6 -bus IEEE RBTS system, the conventional generators are replaced by these new PowerformerTM and then, the reliability indices are evaluated. The simulation results show that the reliability indices such as the expected duration of load curtailment (EDLC) and the expected energy not served (EENS) are improved. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a high voltage generator Powerformer™ on the composite system reliability. The Powerformer™ is directly connected to the high voltage side of the grid; it has higher availability, more reactive power margin, and extra short term <b>overloading</b> <b>capacity.</b> Its impacts are compared with the existing conventional generators using the 24 -bus IEEE-RTS test system. A number of sensitivity analyses are performed and the results are presented. It has been observed that the improvement in the steady state adequacy is largely attributed to its higher availabilities. Importantly its impacts depend on its location, load level and the system topologies. In some cases system indices may improve while load point indices may not or the vice versa. From its presence the buses with major loads and networked in mesh benefit better than the one connected radially and with little load. Its extra reactive power margin has relatively less impact on the adequacy but reduces number of voltage violations...|$|R

The vice-principal advised passengers on the bus to remain calm and be prepared to jump out. However, the bus overturned before the passengers could move. According to one student who survived the accident, most of the children were looking towards the teacher who was lying on the road when the bus overturned. The children who were standing while the bus crashed experienced the heaviest casualties. News correspondents reported that the bus was travelling on one of the steepest parts of the motorway.
