On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve.

2500|$|While {{he wrote}} criticism, Rivette {{continued}} his filmmaking career; {{during the summer}} of 1952, he made his third short film, Le Divertissement. Charles Bitsch called it [...] "a Rohmer-esque Marivaudage between young men and women." [...] Rivette, an assistant to Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, was a cinematographer on Truffaut's short film Une Visite and Rohmer's short Bérénice. Eager to make a feature film, he talked about elaborate adaptions of works by André Gide, Raymond Radiguet and Ernst Jünger. With financial support from Chabrol and producer Pierre Braunberger, Rivette made the 35mm short film Le Coup du Berger in 1956. Written by Rivette, Chabrol and Bitsch, the film is about a young girl who receives a mink coat from her lover and must hide it from her husband; spoken commentary by Rivette describes the action like moves in a chess game. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Jean-Claude Brialy appeared in the film, with Godard, Truffaut, Bitsch and Robert Lachenay as extras. Shot in two weeks in Chabrol's apartment, the budget went entirely to purchasing film stock. It was distributed by Braunberger in 1957. Truffaut called Le Coup du berger the inspiration for him, Chabrol, Alain Resnais and Georges Franju to make their first films: [...] "It had begun. And it had begun thanks to Jacques Rivette. <b>Of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> he was the most fiercely determined to move."

Bermuda was, in a way, his family's salvation, [...] "the promised land of pre-World War II Bermuda that we reached through the wilderness and bewilderness of our first shock and grief." [...] It was also a time in Buechner's life marked by intellectual, spiritual and emotional growth and exploration. [...] Bermuda is therefore central to Buechner's theology as he came to view his deliverance in that enchanting isle [...] "as a gift that implies a giver," [...] an example of that [...] "crazy, holy grace" [...] that sends us experiences not by mere accident of chance but to [...] "open our hearts as well as our eyes." [...] It was in Bermuda that Buechner [...] "caught some bright foreshadowing" [...] of [...] "the secret place of the Most High" [...] that he believed [...] "dwells in all of us as the image of God and in which [...] [...] [...] some part <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> dwells." [...] This is why, when Buechner's character Rooney in The Final Beast is asked to pick one word to describe the power of Bermuda, she says [...] "life [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] It had the smell of life to me."
