40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} and qualified as flight hardware for the measurement of micturition volumes voided by crewmen during Gemini missions. This Chemical Urine Volume Measurement System (CUVMS) is used for obtaining samples of each micturition for post-flight volume determination and laboratory analysis for chemical constituents of physiological interest. The system is versatile with respect to volumes measured, with a capacity beyond the largest micturition expected to be encountered, and with respect to mission duration of inherently indefinite length. The urine sample {{is used for the}} measurement of total micturition volume by a tracer dilution technique, in which a fixed, predetermined amount of tritiated water is introduced and mixed into the voided urine, and the resulting concentration of the tracer in the sample is determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The tracer employed does not interfere with the analysis for the chemical constituents of the urine. The CUVMS hardware consists of a four-way selector valve in which an automatically operated tracer metering pump is incorporated, a collection/mixing bag, and tracer storage accumulators. The assembled system interfaces with a urine receiver at the selector valve inlet, sample bags which connect {{to the side of the}} selector valve, and a flexible hose which carries the excess urine to the <b>overboard</b> <b>drain</b> connection. Results of testing have demonstrated system volume measurement accuracy within the specification limits of +/- 5 %, and operating reliability suitable for system use aboard the GT- 7 mission, in which it was first used...|$|E
5000|$|Fresh {{water is}} {{produced}} by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting [...] "black water" [...] is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German Type VIIC boat [...] was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system. Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in [...] "grey water" [...] tanks and discharged <b>overboard</b> using <b>drain</b> pumps.|$|R
5000|$|Constitution {{emerged from}} a three-year repair period in November 2010. During this time, the entire spar deck was {{stripped}} down to the support beams, and the decking overhead was replaced to restore its original curvature, allowing water to <b>drain</b> <b>overboard</b> and not remain standing on the deck. In addition to decking repairs, 50 hull planks and the main hatch were repaired or replaced. The restoration continued the focus toward keeping her appearance of 1812 by replacing her upper sides so that she now resembles {{what she looked like}} after her triumph over Guerriere, when she gained her nickname [...] "Old Ironsides". The crew of Constitution under Commander Matt Bonner sailed Constitution under her own power on 19 August 2012, the anniversary of her victory over Guerriere. Bonner was Constitutions 72nd commanding officer. Her 74th and current commanding officer is Commander Robert S. Gerosa Jr., who assumed command of Constitution in August 2015.|$|R
