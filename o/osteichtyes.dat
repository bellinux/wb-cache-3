40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} Chlorophtalmus agassizii (<b>Osteichtyes,</b> Chlorophtalmidae) related to size and season were investigated. The diet {{consisted}} largely of crustaceans euphasiids and copepods. Individual size {{was the main}} factor influencing the nature and the quantity of the prey ingested: smaller specimensâ€™ stomach contained {{a great number of}} copepods, while euphasiids were more abundant in the stomachs of larger specimen...|$|E
40|$|Soft {{tissues of}} species of marine fauna; crabs (Crustacea), oysters (Pelecypoda, Bivalvia), sea stars (Asterroidea), sea urchin (Echinoidea) and bony fishes (<b>Osteichtyes)</b> sampled along the Kenya-Mombasa coastal region were {{analyzed}} {{to determine the}} levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Analysis was done using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. This study showed that marine fauna accumulated some OCPs in their tissues, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachlorocyclohexane (BHC) being {{the most common of}} the OCPs. These findings highlight evidence of pollution of marine fauna at the Kenyan coastal sites. It is necessary to have thorough waste management programs as a strategy to minimize marine pollution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn fish, two {{different}} genes, and, exist that encode for very different proteins. Shbga is the ortholog of mammalian Shbg {{and was found}} in all investigated teleosts. In contrast, Shbgb is highly divergent {{and appears to be}} a salmonid-specific protein. Here, we review existing data on fish Shbga and Shbgb that have been obtained in chondrichthyes and <b>osteichtyes.</b> Even though other significant expression sites exist, existing data indicate that Shbga is mainly expressed in liver and subsequently secreted into the blood as a homodimer. In contrast, Shbgb is mainly expressed in the ovary, probably secreted as a monomer, and could contribute to the regulation of local steroid action. Binding studies indicate a specialization of circulating Shbg during evolution towards the preferential binding of estradiol and testosterone in teleosts. In contrast, specific fish steroids such as 11 -oxo-androgens and oocyte maturation-inducing steroids that are crucial for reproduction are poorly bound by either form of Shbg...|$|E
