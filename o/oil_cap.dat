Permeability to water and stretching and bursting of the plasma membrane in hypotonic sea water changed markedly with age. These studieswillbe reportedlater. The presentstudy isdevoted to a considerationof the viscositychanges. PROCEDURE Eggs from each female, if in good physiological condition, were washed in 200 cc. sea water. Aliquot portions were transferred to flat finger bowls with 150 cc. sea water. Morning and evening the super natant water was removed, the eggs transferred to clean bowls, and sea water added. Sea water was collected in quantity at high tide, filtered and stored. The pH was 8. 3. The temperature in the bowls varied from 18 to 22 Â°C., but during an experiment within 2. 5 Â°,usually within 1. 5 Â°C. At successive ages eggs from the same bowl were centrifuged by a slightmodificationof the method developed by Heilbrunn (1928).

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the incorporation of a new additive to asphalt cement <b>oil</b> (<b>CAP).</b> A polyol product was obtained through the oxypropylation reaction of sugarcane bagasse. This polyol was polymerised with pyromellitic anhydride in order to obtain a polyester (BCP) to test its suitability in terms of the material properties to be applied as additives. FTIR spectra of the polymerised material (BCP) confirmed the occurrence of chemical modification due to the appearance of a new band at 1750 cm- 1, characteristic of ester groups. The TGA data showed that the BCP product had higher thermal stability than the polyol. According to the softening point and elastic recovery tests, the incorporation of 11 % and 16 % w/w BCP in conventional CAP met the specifications of regulatory standards...|$|E
40|$|When an oil {{reservoir}} is underlain by an aquifer, oil production draws {{the water from}} the aquifer upward, forming a water cone, which under adverse conditions enters in the production well leading to high water cuts. An alternative option is to produce above the critical rate from the aquifer, i. e., at such a rate that the oil cone is drawn into the well. Analytical models, such as derived by Muskat et al. allow to determine the critical rate in terms of simple expressions for interface models that thus ignore relative permeability and capillary pressure effects. Including these effects requires numerical modeling. The numerical modeling of this process is a challenge, because of the occurrence of steep water-oil fronts in the flow direction and the small width of the cone near the production well, which coincides with high production rates. This thesis investigates the possibility of using finite elements for the simulation of oil down-coning. The advantage of finite elements is that it allows grid refinement in regions where large variations occur. A diffusion coefficient is introduced in the saturation equation to smoothen the numerical solution, hereby decreasing the occurrence of flow singularities and allowing larger element sizes, thus decreasing the computation time. The computer model is then used to simulate coning of the oil-water interface, towards a single production well situated {{at the bottom of a}} reservoir. The considered reservoir geometry is radially symmetric, so that calculations can be done for a two-dimensional section. The model includes relative permeabilities, capillary pressure and gravity effects. To avoid infinite capillary pressure at connate water saturation, we use a fractal model for continuation of the capillary pressure below a defined critical water saturation. The height of the oil-water interface is not kept constant at the external radius, so that all oil is free to move through the reservoir. Simulations are done for scenarios with different fluid parameters, and variating drawdown rates. For certain drawdown rates, a stationary profile of the interface occurs. If this does, the height of the cone is within the range of values given by the interface model. However, critical rates provided by the derived interface model is not satisfied in the numerical model, since breakthrough does occur in simulations with rates below this critical rate. This is due to the neglecting of capillary force and relative permeabilities in the interface model. The numerical model in this study represents a reservoir where the initial <b>oil</b> <b>cap</b> is of limited radial extend, because the height of the oil column at the external radius decreases and is not kept fixed at a certain height, and is therefore not representative for a reservoir with larger interface size.

[...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, <b>oil</b> <b>caps,</b> drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R
