He looked for his clothes, that he might arise and extricate himself from this den of horrors; but his clothes were nowhere to be seen, nor did he see his portmanteau, or sea-chest. It was much to be apprehended he would never see them more.|$|E

"Sir," [...] said she, [...] "all our victuals being gone, after I had fasted one day, {{my stomach}} was very sickly, and, at the approach, of night, I was {{inclined}} to yawning and sleepy. When I slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a little refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being more and more sickly, I lay down again, but could not sleep, being very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second day with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with reachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, buying plenty of provisions; and dined heartily. But when I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of wine, which being mixed with sugar, I drank up; but for want of substance to digest upon, the fumes of it got into my head, & made me senseless for some time. The third day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten a little child if it had come in my way; during which time, I was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of these fits I fell down, and struck my face against the corner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> bed, where my mistress lay; the blood gushed out of my nose, but by my excessive bleeding, both {{the violence of the}} fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. After this, I grew sick again, strove to vomit, but could not; then bleeding a second time, I swooned away as dead; when I came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in my stomach, which went of towards night, with a longing desire for food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but it came up again; then I drank water without sugar, and that staid with me. I laid me down on the bed, praying God would take me away: after I had slumbered, I thought myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to God, and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. All this while my departing mistress lay by me: the last bit of bread she had, she gave to her dear child my young master. The morning after, I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that into hunger. I espied the blood that came from my nose in a bison, which I immediately swallowed up. At night I had the usual variations, as the pain in the stomach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous: and I had no thought but that I should die before morning. In the morning came on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my young master's lamentations, by which I understood his mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, A sail! A sail! hallooing as if they were distracted for joy of that relief, which afterwards we received from your hands." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{standard}} for unit loads is MIL-STD-1660, a {{standard for}} ammunition unit loads. DOD unit loads generally use 40 x 48 in pallets, which unfortunately do not pack efficiently into ISO containers. They weigh less than 4000 lb to limit the stresses on handling equipment. They are weatherproof, and stack 16 ft high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. MIL-STD-1660 mandates that loads must never be less than the width <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet,</b> while permitting some overhang. The markings are LOGMARS bar codes and standard inventory numbers. The standard describes major parts of the logistic path, including storage, ship, air, truck, forklift and sling (i.e. ship-to-ship and parachute). There are auxiliary standards for ship-to-ship transfers, and amphibious transfers. There are tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention (i.e. weather), and safe disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Unit load {{formation}} {{equipment is}} used to restrict materials so that they maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of unit load formation equipment include pallets, skids, slipsheets, tote pans, bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. A pallet is a platform made of wood (the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for subsequent lifting purposes. A slipsheet is a thick piece of paper, corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can be grabbed by special push/pull lift truck attachments. They are used in place <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the thermal inertia <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> loaded with returnable plastic crates containing primary packages of smoked ham. Based on this, food quality variations within the pallet were also investigated. Thermal time constants from 83 sensor locations were identified by studying the temperature changes when the pallet was exposed to instant temperature drops (16 C - 2 C) and temperature elevations (2 C - 16 C). The thermal time constants were used in microbiological prediction models to calculate the maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots in the pallet unit load, when temperature elevated from 4 C to a higher temperature (ranging from 4. 5 C to 12 C), during different periods of time (ranging from 0. 5 h to 200 h). The results showed a maximum difference in shelf life of approximately 1. 8 days. The identified thermal time constants were also {{used to calculate the}} maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pallet</b> unit load, in a real chilled food supply chain lasting for about 2. 5 days. This resulted in a maximum difference of 0. 1 days. The results imply that the location of a product in a pallet has a relatively low influence on the product shelf life. This means that a temperature sensor used for calculating the predicted shelf life of a product, can be placed relatively far from the product itself (e. g. on the secondary package or even on the pallet) without jeopardizing the reliability of the resulting shelflife prediction. However, the results also emphasize the importance of continuous temperature monitoring along the entire chilled food supply chains...|$|E

First of all, we develop a deterministic model to optimally allocate pallets when managers have perfect knowledge of the information that will be available.

In the case of workpiece change the auxiliary time is reduced by adopting the use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automatic <b>pallet</b> changer system and implicitly of pallets, while {{in the case of}} tool change this time is reduced using an automatic tool changer system. The optimization of the constructive and functional parameters of palletizing systems, in the purpose of decreasing auxiliary times, implies increased speed and accelerations, inertia reduction, an optimum transmission ratio, component mechanisms coupled movements, increasing the positioning accuracy of the pallet on the machine table. This paper presents the methodology of transmission ratio optimization <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric driven <b>pallet</b> changer mechanism; the main purpose is to obtain the maximum acceleration. In order to find the maximum acceleration of the electric driven pallet changing mechanism considered, and thus minimizing the total changing time, we use the equilibrium equation of the moments reduced to the motor shaft.
