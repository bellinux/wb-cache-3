5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an <b>offset</b> <b>value.</b> With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E

40|$|A sigmoid {{function}} has been utilized for the input/output {{functions of the}} back-propagation type neural networks.

500|$|The {{same is true}} {{with regard}} to the {{real-world}} dependency on the kilogram: if the mass of the IPK was found to have changed slightly, there would be no automatic effect upon the other units of measure because their practical realizations provide an insulating layer of abstraction. Any discrepancy would eventually have to be reconciled though, because the virtue of the SI system is its precise mathematical and logical harmony amongst its units. If the IPK's value were definitively proven to have changed, one solution would be to simply redefine the kilogram as being equal to the mass of the IPK plus an <b>offset</b> <b>value,</b> similarly to what is currently done with its replicas; e.g., [...] "the kilogram is equal to the mass of the [...] (equivalent to 42µg).|$|E

Measurements of the AlSb/GaSb and GaSb/ZnTe valence-band offsets demonstrated a clear violation of band offset transitivity for the AlSb/GaSb/ZnTe material system, suggesting that chemical reactivity at the AlSb/ZnTe and GaSb/ZnTe interfaces can exert a significant influence on band <b>offset</b> <b>values.</b> Direct evidence {{of the influence of}} interfacial growth conditions on the AlSb/ZnTe and GaSb/ZnTe band <b>offset</b> <b>values</b> was also observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper pays a great {{attention}} {{to the process of}} calculating the burst offset time in Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks. The blocking probability of the burst in the case of using variable offset time is studied through theoretical analysis. The analysis is based on the first-passage-time distributions. In order to perform offset time management, two algorithms have been used to determine the optimum <b>offset</b> <b>values</b> in order to guarantee an objective blocking probability value. Of course, the optimum <b>offset</b> <b>values</b> obtained greatly solve the fairness problem. As a result, for all ingress-egress node pairs in an OBS network, bursts with different hop lengths have equal likelihood to get through. The results for three cases are presented...|$|R

However at higher fractional frequency <b>offset</b> <b>values,</b> normalized to subcarrier separation, self ICI cancellation scheme can no longer provide the same performance. Further due to the simple structure of repetition code, self ICI cancellation scheme alone cannot provide much immunity to channel interference. In this paper we combine a maximum likelihood estimation technique with that scheme {{to get a better}} immunity for frequency errors at higher fractional frequency <b>offset</b> <b>values.</b> This paper also discusses the possibility of application of a bandwidth efficient coding scheme for the considered cancellation scheme, to obtain the immunity to channel interference without further reducing bandwidth efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{significant}} challenge {{when using}} industrial robots as flexible handling devices - {{for example in}} the area of creating miniaturized conductive patterns on three dimensional molded interconnect devices - is their relatively low absolute accuracy, which is caused by inaccuracies in the robots kinematic chain. This characteristic has to be considered, especially if complex and precise 3 D-movements are needed. One approach to overcome this problem investigated at FAPS is the usage of a specially designed robot control system with parallel data processing for real-time correction value determination and usage of these values for remote control of a robot to improve its accuracy. The developed control system utilizes existing network technologies and uses data of sensor systems for continuous process monitoring to derive the robots actual state in course of its movement. In case of a high speed camera the image data is acquired by the control system via a first thread and subsequently the actual robot position is calculated based on this data. At the same time, for determining the robots target state, the system continuously requests the robots nominal position from the robot controller by utilizing a parallel second thread. The information describing the robots actual state is then compared with the sensor data for calculating <b>offset</b> <b>values.</b> These <b>offset</b> <b>values</b> are subsequently filtered and a correction value is calculated. In a third parallel thread new movement instructions are generated, considering the <b>offset</b> <b>values</b> as well as the robots target trajectory. Finally, for remote control of the robot, these movement instructions are transferred to the robot controller...|$|R
