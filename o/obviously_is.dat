It is these characters' chronic inability {{to find the}} missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. [...] Most <b>obviously</b> <b>is</b> the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in The Cat o' Nine Tails, who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied {{to him by his}} niece to solve a mystery. [...] In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be [...] "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not [...] "miss" [...] anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In Deep Red, Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer {{at the scene of the}} crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to Douglas E. Winter, creates [...] "a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing".|$|E

The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, <b>obviously,</b> <b>is</b> that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, <b>obviously,</b> <b>is,</b> 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that <b>obviously</b> <b>is</b> going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

[...] However, the availability of light, the source of energy for photosynthesis, and mineral nutrients, the building blocks for new growth, play crucial roles in regulating primary {{production in the}} ocean.

Although there <b>obviously</b> <b>is</b> no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific [...] "orthodoxy" [...] may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of [...] "pseudo-science."

2500|$|In September 2009, Tricky Stewart {{revealed}} that Ciara {{had been working}} on her fourth studio album. At the time the project was set to be produced solely by trio of Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ciara herself. Stewart described the studio sessions as [...] "feeling good" [...] with the music [...] "having a good vibe". On the record's theme he said [...] " [...] is <b>obviously</b> <b>is</b> gonna have tempo to it, but I think it's gonna have even more substance than the last record. She dances and we always want to bring out what she does that other people don't." [...] Additionally the trio said that they intended the album to contain no features except for one collaboration with The-Dream, although there would features on remixes. They had wanted to release the album in 2009 but accepted that a 2010 release was more realistic. Later in an interview with Rap-Up magazine, two songs were name dropped, [...] "Speechless" [...] which was the aforementioned feature with The-Dream and [...] "Gifted." [...] Both songs where tipped to appear on the album, though on the final track listing only [...] "Speechless" [...] made the album without The-Dream's vocals.

[...] "In a media landscape where gay, lesbian and bisexual characters are still often defined mainly by their sexuality, having Lexa—one of the show's strongest, most well-liked characters—casually reveal that she's queer and then carry on with her day sends a strong and important message to young viewers," [...] stated Wilken. [...] "However, there's a big difference between having a supporting character (however brilliant) play the pronoun game, and actually featuring a same-sex pairing on the show." [...] She said The CW did not have [...] "a single queer main character on any of the network's currently running shows" [...] and that needed to change. [...] "The next step, <b>obviously,</b> <b>is</b> the visual: The 100 has made it pretty clear that gender, race and sexuality are not issues worth bringing up in conversation, which is great," [...] said Wilken. [...] "But then, following this Show-Don't-Tell approach, how about actually featuring a same-sex pairing on the air? Give her a love interest, however fleeting. The ball's in your court, writers." [...] To this point, Rothenberg had Clarke have sex with a different woman in season 3 (while parted from Lexa) {{to make it clear that}} Clarke is bisexual, ensuring she would be viewed as a lead LGBT character.|$|E

60|$|Finally, it {{is worth}} noticing that, though natural {{selection}} is scientifically explicable, variation is not. Thus far the cause of variation, or {{the reason why the}} offspring is sometimes unlike the parents, is just as mysterious as the reason why it is generally like the parents. It is now as inexplicable as any other origination; and, if ever explained, the explanation will only carry up the sequence of secondary causes one step farther, and bring us in face of a somewhat different problem, but which will have the same element of mystery that the problem of variation has now. Circumstances may preserve or may destroy the variations man may use or direct them but selection whether artificial or natural no more originates them than man originates the power which turns a wheel when he dams a stream and lets the water fall upon it The origination of this power is a question about efficient cause. The tendency of science in respect to this <b>obviously</b> <b>is</b> not toward the omnipotence of matter, as some suppose, but to ward the omnipotence of spirit.|$|E
