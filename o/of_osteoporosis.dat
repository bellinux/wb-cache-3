5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is {{an adult}} female {{that lived in}} Zürich Zoo. It is {{represented}} by a virtually complete skeleton, but the skin was not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs <b>of</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> and periodontitis (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen. Schwartz selected this specimen as the holotype. The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both permanent and deciduous teeth. Specimens of Pseudopotto are at least superficially similar to pottos, but according to Schwartz, they differ {{in a number of}} traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false potto and true pottos as well as angwantibos and slow lorises (Nycticebus). The false potto is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation; small size is also seen in western pottos.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes <b>of</b> <b>osteoporosis,</b> and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

40|$|In the {{pathogenesis}} <b>of</b> paediatric <b>osteoporosis,</b> genetic causes may {{play an important}} role.

This {{is largely due to}} the discovery of many new genetic causes in patients with a clear clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta but also due to the identification of genetic causes in patients with isolated or non-syndromal osteoporosis with fractures. In this chapter, known monogenic causes of syndromal and non-syndromal osteoporosis in children will be described.

40|$|Currently {{available}} medications, such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and teriparatides, {{have shown}} {{their ability to}} reduce vertebral and/or nonvertebral fractures. Questions remain regarding their long-term innocuousness and several studies showed that adhering to currently marketed anti-osteoporotic medications remain sub-optimal.

40|$|AbstractTransient {{osteoporosis}} (TO) is {{a clinical}} syndrome characterized by joint {{pain and the}} presence of bone marrow edema on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both of which spontaneously resolve over time. Transient osteoporosis most commonly affects the hip, but also may involve other lower extremity sites. TO likely represents a disorder that may be monoarticular or “migratory” with involvement of two or more lower extremity sites sequentially affected over a number of months. We report on two cases <b>of</b> transient <b>osteoporosis,</b> one involving the knee and one involving the hip, demonstrating the utility of serial bone mineral density measurements at both sites. Additionally, we are able to report on the microarchitectural changes seen at the distal femur on ultra-high resolution (7 T) MRI. Case # 1 describes a recurrence <b>of</b> transient <b>osteoporosis</b> <b>of</b> the hip three years after a similar presentation at the contralateral hip and highlights the findings of rapidly changing bone mineral density in this clinical syndrome. In contrast to the spine, hip and forearm, peripheral bone density measurements at the knee are rarely reported and to our knowledge Case # 2 represents the first report <b>of</b> transient <b>osteoporosis</b> <b>of</b> the knee demonstrating bone density findings similar to that seen in the hip. We postulate that transient <b>osteoporosis</b> <b>of</b> the knee is part of a clinical spectrum most commonly seen in the hip and one that is marked by lower extremity joint pain, bone marrow edema on MRI and transient decreases in bone mineral density all of which spontaneously resolve without sequelae...|$|R
