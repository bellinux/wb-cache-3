Understanding this learning process and continuously supports on the universal right to learn, we require a proper external and eternal preparedness. Adult {{learning is}} an interactive and creative way of accepting and transmitting new information in strengthening the equal right to remain relevant to the current needs. However, in certain circumstances the process of gaining knowledge has its limitation of aim, period and cost. This paper, unveils an adult interactive learning as project-based through interviewing method. Being adult learners, we wish to share our perspective-taking to achieve the insight of the contour of others’ in order to understand a vast realm of experiences beyond our own. The aim of applying interactive adult learning is to understand and extract as much as possible the knowledge and understanding critical views from the heritage <b>observers</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> in the area of knowledge of urban heritage revitalization. The psychological setting in this ‘learning and teaching environment’ is through adult learners’ consideration that heritage observers and heritage experts play a role as ‘mentor’ as they are expert in their field and researchers as ‘mentee’ who are new in the field. Hopefully, this process of learning encountered the diversity of learning processes so that it will elevate researcher's mind to reach beyond the urban heritage revitalization's cognitive skills and professionalism...|$|E

Material and methodsOver a one-year period, 11 pairs, comprised each of a radiation oncologist and nuclear medicine physician with limited experience in PET/CT-based TVD for NSCLC from nine different countries took part in a training program through an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) study (NCT 02247713). Teams delineated gross tumor volume of the primary tumor, during and after training interventions, according to a provided delineation protocol. In-house developed software recorded the performed delineations, to allow visual inspection of strategies and to assess delineation accuracy. ResultsFollowing the first training, overall concordance indices for 3 repetitive cases increased from 0. 57 ± 0. 07 to 0. 66 ± 0. 07. The overall mean surface distance between <b>observer</b> <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> contours decreased from − 0. 40 ± 0. 03 cm to − 0. 01 ± 0. 33 cm. After further training overall concordance indices for another 3 repetitive cases further increased from 0. 64 ± 0. 06 to 0. 80 ± 0. 05 (p= 0. 01). Mean surface distances decreased from − 0. 34 ± 0. 16 cm to − 0. 05 ± 0. 20 cm (p= 0. 01).

40|$|The {{important}} role of medical trainees (interns and residents) as teachers is increasingly recognized in veterinary and human medicine, but often is not supported through adult learning programs or other preparatory training methods. To develop appropriate teaching programs focused on effective clinical teaching, more understanding is needed about the support required for the trainee’s teaching role. Following discussion among faculty members from education and veterinary and pediatric medicine, an experienced external <b>observer</b> <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> in higher education observed 28 incoming and outgoing veterinary and pediatric trainees in multiple clinical teaching settings over 10 weeks. Using an interpretative approach to analyze the data, we identified five dynamics {{that could serve as}} the foundation for a new program to support clinical teaching: (1) Novice–Expert, recognizing transitions between roles; (2) Collaboration–Individuality, recognizing the power of peer learning; (3) Confidence–Uncertainty, regarding the confidence to act; (4) Role–Interdisciplinarity, recognizing the ability to maintain a discrete role and yet synthesize knowledge and cope with complexity; and (5) Socialization–Identity, taking on different selves. Trainees in veterinary and human medicine appeared to have similar needs for support in teaching and would benefit from a variety of strategies: faculty should provide written guidelines and practical teaching tips; set clear expectations; establish sustained support strategies, including contact with an impartial educator; identify physical spaces in which to discuss teaching; provide continuous feedback; and facilitate peer observation across medical and veterinary clinical environments...|$|R

During aggressive encounters, creating {{uncertainty in}} your opponent may be the objective, where acts of aggression may be used to test the boundaries of other group members. The primary aim of this thesis was to explore whether the postural displays and aggressive threats used by male vervet monkeys are aggressive in the combative sense or communicative, affording the negotiation of social space. First, the existence of the red-white-and-blue (RWB) and broadside displays was confirmed in a population of wild vervets monkeys, although rarely in the archetypical way as described previously. Through an exploration of male vervet genital displays during the mating season, I found that eye contact {{played an important role in}} whether a display escalated into additional threatening, both displays and threats occur within striking distance (equal to or less than one monkey body length apart), and that males were constantly striving to maintain a stable face-to-face perception of their opponent. These overt signals are likely also accompanied by cues, some of which may indicate dominance rank. Two samples of <b>observers,</b> undergraduates <b>and</b> <b>experts,</b> were able to detect the relative dominance of male vervets in a non-social setting.

Of the 38 million foreign-born residents in the United States, approximately one-third are naturalized citizens, one-third are legal permanent residents, and one-third are estimated to be unauthorized (illegal) residents. Some <b>observers</b> <b>and</b> policy <b>experts</b> maintain that the presence of an estimated 11 million unauthorized residents is evidence of flaws in the legal immigration system as well as failures of immigration control policies and practices. The 111 th Congress is faced with strategic questions of whether to continue to build on incremental reforms of specific elements of immigration (e. g., employment verification, skilled migration, temporary workers, worksite enforcement, and legalization of certain categories of unauthorized residents) or whether to comprehensively reform the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). President Barack Obama has affirmed his support for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that includes increased enforcement as well as a pathway to legal residence for certain unauthorized residents.

The gross tumor volume (GTV), and two clinical target volumes (CTVA, including the internal iliac, presacral, and perirectal nodes, and CTVB, which included the external iliac nodes) were contoured. The observers were randomly assigned to receipt (Group A) or nonreceipt (Group B) of a consensus guideline and atlas for anorectal cancers and then instructed to recontour the same case/images (Scan 2). Observer variation was analyzed volumetrically using the conformation number (CN, where CN = 1 equals total agreement). Of 14 evaluable contour sets (1 <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> 7 Group A and 6 Group B observers), greater agreement was found for the GTV (mean CN, 0. 75) than for the CTVs (mean CN, 0. 46 - 0. 65).

Whether the 112 th Congress will address immigration reform in the midst of historically high levels of unemployment and budgetary constrictions is difficult to project. The number of foreign-born people residing in the United States is at the highest level in U. S. history and has reached a proportion of the U. S. population— 12. 5 %—not seen since the early 20 th century. Of the 38 million foreign-born residents in the United States, approximately 16. 4 million are naturalized citizens. The remaining 21. 6 million foreign-born residents are noncitizens. According to the latest estimates by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), about 10. 8 million unauthorized aliens were living in the United States in January 2010, down from a peak of 11. 8 million in January 2007. Some <b>observers</b> <b>and</b> policy <b>experts</b> maintain that the presence of millions of unauthorized residents is evidence of inadequacies in the legal immigration system as well as failures of immigration control policies and practices.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an output {{feedback}} controller {{design for a}} class of bi-modal piecewise linear systems. The proposed output feedback controller consists of a switching state <b>observer</b> <b>and</b> a static state feedback. The <b>observer</b> <b>and</b> the controller are designed separately using the techniques of input-to-state stability (ISS). A sufficient condition for the global asymptotic stability of the system in the closed loop with a designed <b>observer</b> <b>and</b> state feedback is derived. The derived theory is illustrated by an example...|$|R
