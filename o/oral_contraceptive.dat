40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> are {{the most}} widely used {{hormonal}} contraceptive among young Norwegian women, yet the younger age groups demonstrate high rates of unplanned pregnancies and induced abortions. The aim of this investigation was to increase the understanding of how frequent users of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> experience side effects, if side effects are more common among certain types of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and whether side effects are associated with reduced compliance or discontinuation of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> Method: We wanted to investigate how the topics presented themselves among users of SUSS, a health information service for young adults. Web inquiries in the SUSS database from 2005 - 2009 were searched for brands of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> side effects and reduced compliance. Results were descriptively presented. For the literature presentation the following search words were used: <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> side effects, adverse effects, dissatisfaction, compliance and discontinuation. Findings: Among 2420 SUSS requests about <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> 46 % mentioned side effects. Among those bleeding was the most frequently reported side effect, in 18 % of the inquiries, and the rate varied from 37 % to 63 % for different brands. Estrogen related side effects were reported by 7 % and progesterone related side effects by 10 %. In comparing high dose and low dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> users of low dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> reported a higher rate of bleeding (20 %) than the high dose users (16 %). Estrogen related side effects were not found to be more common among users of high dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (7 %) compared to low dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (6 %), nor were progesterone related side effects or other side effects shown to be of different occurrence between the groups. 22 % of the inquiries concerned reduced compliance or discontinuation of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> The rate varied from 5 % to 28 % for different brands. Brands with a high rate of reported side effects were not found among those with the highest rates of reduced compliance or discontinuation. Among users of high dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> 24 % reported bleeding as a side effect, and 16 % of the requests concerned reduced compliance or discontinuation, among users of low dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> the corresponding values were 20 % and 20 %. Conclusion: The results from the SUSS database show that bleeding is the most commonly reported side effect among users of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> {{and that there is a}} higher incidence of bleeding among users of low dose <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> The results did not display a clear association between side effects and reduced compliance or discontinuation. Doctors, midwifes and nurses have an important function in caring for young users of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> through careful counseling about side effects to increase compliance and reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancies...|$|R
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive.</b> Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
