5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E

Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors.

5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E

He also asserted it lacked effective and visionary leadership, that globalization of local businesses had robbed the organization <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> <b>that</b> excessive partisanship at the federal and state levels make progress nearly impossible, and that many of the problems now confronting the city are regional in nature.|$|E

25|$|However {{the power}} that a prime {{minister}} has over his or her cabinet colleagues is directly proportional to the amount <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Also when a party is divided into factions a Prime Minister {{may be forced to}} include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The Prime Minister's personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).|$|E
25|$|Lozano Díaz {{began his}} period as {{president}} {{with a broad}} base <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> eroded rapidly. He unveiled an ambitious development plan to be financed by international loans and increased taxes and also introduced the nation's first labor code. This document guaranteed workers the right to organize and strike but gave employers the right of lockout and forbade strikes in public services. The code also embodied some social welfare and minimum-wage provisions and regulated hours and working conditions. All these provisions gained him some labor support, but in later months relations {{between the president and}} labor began to sour.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to get La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats and had to desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not until}} 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. The reasons they argued to get their independent status were the distance that Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population was more than enough to get the municipality designation and the lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1754, {{on the eve of the}} French and Indian War, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania {{delegation}} to Albany. London had invoked the meeting, hoping to win assurances of Iroquois support in the looming war with the French. Present were representatives of the Iroquois and seven colonies. Because of divisions within both the British and Native American ranks, the council did not result in the treaty <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> the crown desired. Instead, each colony made the best deal it could with individual Iroquois leaders. Weiser was able to negotiate one of the more successful, in which some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part, still claimed by Virginia.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{assessment}} of infantile reflexes {{is also a}} diagnostic tool, such as the Moro reflex and the Romberg Test. The Moro reflex is rarely present in infants after 6 months of age and is characterized {{as a response to}} a sudden loss <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> causes the infant to feel like it is falling. The infant will respond by abduction and adduction (or spreading and unspreading) of the arms, as well as crying. The Moro reflex is significant in evaluating the integration of the central nervous system and patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will show a persistence and exacerbation of the reflex. In addition, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will rarely show a positive Romberg test, which indicates that there is localized cerebellar dysfunction.|$|E

Because there is no network <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> goes out to veterans, some believe that Pakistan's veterans are facing similar issues like those faced by Vietnam veterans.

25|$|Stationary trench warfare having set in, the {{battalion}} {{was brought up}} to strength before a new attempt on the Turkish position (the Third Battle of Gaza) began on 2 November. After the 161st and 163rd Brigades had advanced up the coast to capture the Gaza defences, A Company 1/4th Northamptons was to pass through with tanks in support and capture the positions known as 'Lion', 'Tiger' and 'Dog', north west of Gaza, clear the beach of Wire entanglements to allow the cavalry through, and finally to occupy a defensive line to cover their withdrawal if required. By 06.30 {{the first part of}} the operation had succeeded, and A Company passed through, and captured 'Lion' about 1500 yards further on within an hour, despite the breakdown of the tanks and the ineffectiveness of the covering machine-gun barrage due to mist. The wire on the beach was cleared, but the remaining objectives could not be taken before the Turks counter-attacked. The company was so far ahead <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> it had to be withdrawn. Further attempts at the same operation also failed in face of counterattacks. The Northamptons suffered heavy casualties: five officers and 45 other ranks killed, three officers and 129 other ranks wounded, and 33 missing. However, the attack on the Beersheba position was successful and the Turks retreated, the 1/4th reaching the outskirts of Jaffa by 25 November.|$|E

Jennings easily won reelection, thanks to an expanding base <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> included the growing community of Harmonists. Following his reelection, Jennings developed jaundice, an illness often caused by alcoholism, but he recovered.

500|$|To {{travel to}} the Middle East and {{purchase}} horses, Davenport needed to obtain diplomatic permission from {{the government of the}} Ottoman Empire, and specifically from Sultan Abdul Hamid II.

To the surprise of both Davenport and the Ambassador, the permit, called an Iradé, was granted, allowing the export of [...] "six or eight" [...] horses. [...] Davenport and his traveling companions left the United States on July 5, 1906, traveling to France by ship and from there to Constantinople by train. [...] Upon arrival, the Iradé was authenticated, and clarified that Davenport would be allowed to export both mares and stallions. Davenport's accomplishment was notable for several reasons. [...] It was the first time Arabian horses officially had been allowed to be exported from the Ottoman Empire in 35 years. It was also notable that Davenport not only was able to purchase stallions, which were often available for sale to outsiders, [...] but also mares, which were treasured by the Bedouin; the best war mares generally were not for sale at any price.|$|E
