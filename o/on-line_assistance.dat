40|$|REASON: An {{intelligent}} user {{assistant for}} interactive environments The provision of intelligent user assistance {{has been an}} ongoing problem in designing computer interfaces. Interactive computing environments must support expert as well as novice users when providing advice for error correction and answers to questions directed to a system. To address these issues, we have investigated the application of fairly well-understood artificial intelligence techniques in novel ways to provide intelligent help. This paper describes the design methodology used to build REASON (Real-time Explanation And SuggestiON), an intelligent user-assistant prototype for a windowed, multitasking environment. REASON'S central component is an inference engine that solves problems arising from a user's activity. When the user makes one of several different kinds of errors, the inference engine offers dynamically generated suggestions about what the user might have intended. The user can also query REASON using natural language. In addition to providing suggestions of corrected input or answers to questions, REASON can provide two complementary types of explanations of these responses, derived from the inferences that led to them. uch of the recent work in designing help M systems for computer users has {{been influenced by the}} difficulties that people have in learning how to interact with c~mputers. &quot; ~ However, one of the most common, yet arguably least successful, computer applications is <b>on-line</b> user <b>assistance.</b> In studying new user interface technology, there is a considerable base of work in the areas of contextual assistance, user modeling, planning and proble...|$|R

Its {{objectives}} are to develop and validate an advanced games and simulations environment, based on a Web Services and telecommunications architecture to support the development and experimental activities of the generic game and simulation shells of the SAGE portal. This environment will support multi-user functions by means of transactional and interpersonal types of interactivity. Relying on a Web Services model, the environment will allow real-time interaction (digital telephony or videoconferencing) and animation (video, voice, sound, graphics or images). This advanced environment will provide transparent support for games and simulations developed {{by means of the}} generic shells implemented in the SSHRC-INE project. The core of the ENJEUX-S project integrates the components of real-time communication in the domain of Internet-based educational games and simulations. This integration - one of the original aspects of this project - enables the utilisation of enhanced educational situations (feedback, <b>on-line</b> dialogue, immediate <b>assistance,</b> shared strategies, help, etc.), where the real world meets the virtual world so as to investigate simple or complex 2 -D or 3 -D learning situations.

Partner agencies involved in this multi-agency, multijurisdiction integration effort include: • Federal. US Army Corps of Engineers for Section 10 and Section 404 permits; US Coast Guard for Section 9 permits; and Federal Highways (WA); • State. Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife for HPA permits; Washington State Department of Ecology for Section 401, CZM consistency, and shoreline permits; Washington State Department of Natural Resources for Aquatic Use Authorizations; Washington State Department of Health for on-site septic approvals; Washington State Department of Transportation; Washington State Office of Regulatory Assistance; Washington State Office of Financial Management; and Washington State Natural Resources Information Portal Project; and • Local. King County for local shoreline, critical areas, and zoning permits. Key elements of the web-based permitting approach include: • One-Stop JARPA Permitting Site. Interactive web application providing WSDOT and others with: (i) a single, integrated source of local, state, and federal permitting and regulatory guidance, glossary, tips, FAQs, examples, and step-by-step instruction from the above permitting and regulatory agencies; (ii) downloadable “one-stop” permitting forms (e. g., web-enabled multi-agency Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) form); (iii) secure upload functionality to ensure all regulatory agencies are looking at and seeing the same application materials and environmental discipline reports; and (iv) on-line search, retrieve, and archive capability. See [URL] • <b>On-Line</b> Permit <b>Assistance</b> System (OPAS). Interactive, query-based application designed to help applicants and WSDOT determine permitting requirements based upon answers given to select project questions {{and the extent to which}} certain regulatory thresholds are met or exceeded.

Interactive process and timeline flowcharts depicting sequence and steps associated with select permitting and regulatory processes, including Section 404, Section 10, HPA, Shoreline, CZM, SEPA, NEPA, NPDES Stormwater, Air Operating, Water Rights, NPDES, and more. Permit Process Schematics coupled with customized OPAS narrative reports provide applicants and WSDOT with a comprehensive overview of applicable permit and regulatory requirements. See [URL] Project Purpose Statement: The purpose of the Office of Regulatory Assistance’s effort to work with WSDOT and others to advance integration of permitting and regulatory requirements through the above described web elements is largely to: • Provide clear, accessible, and uniformly presented information in a similar format and level of detail; • Enhance and promote permitting and regulatory accountability and transparency; • Provide a means to foster and enable continuous process improvement and innovation; and • Improve by lessening decision-making review and transaction times and increasing overall quality of submitted application materials and documentation. Brief Project Overview and Methodology: Development of the above described web elements has largely occurred through cooperative agreement and participation from the above agencies. Leadership and staffing from the Office of Regulatory Assistance has provided the vision and sense of direction necessary to unify and secure the engagement and participation from the agencies. Development occurs through a consultant, agency IT staff, and a multi-agency steering group. Explanation of Current or Anticipated Results: Beta testing to date has resulted in higher quality permit applications being submitted to local, state, and federal regulatory agencies (via the Washington State Multi-Agency Permitting Team for Transportation). Additionally, web elements have generated productive process improvement and process clarity changes within the regulatory agencies. Clear and accurate information, acquired and factored in early in the process, results in greater attention to regulatory and permitting requirements as well as better and more fully informed compliance (or better yet, impact avoidance as a result of likely regulatory obligation).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Integrated Analysis Capability (IAC) system {{is to provide a}} highly effective, interactive analysis tool for the integrated design of large structures. IAC was developed to interface programs from the fields of structures, thermodynamics, controls, and system dynamics with an executive system and a database to yield a highly efficient multi-disciplinary system. Special attention is given to user requirements such as data handling and <b>on-line</b> <b>assistance</b> with operational features, and the ability to add new modules of the user's choice at a future date. IAC contains an executive system, a database, general utilities, interfaces to various engineering programs, and a framework for building interfaces to other programs. IAC has shown itself to be effective in automating data transfer among analysis programs. The IAC system architecture is modular in design. 1) The executive module contains an input command processor, an extensive data management system, and driver code to execute the application modules. 2) Technical modules provide standalone computational capability as well as support for various solution paths or coupled analyses. 3) Graphics and model generation modules are supplied for building and viewing models. 4) Interface modules provide for the required data flow between IAC and other modules. 5) User modules can be arbitrary executable programs or JCL procedures with no pre-defined relationship to IAC. 6) Special purpose modules are included, such as MIMIC (Model Integration via Mesh Interpolation Coefficients), which transforms field values from one model to another; LINK, which simplifies incorporation of user specific modules into IAC modules; and DATAPAC, the National Bureau of Standards statistical analysis package. The IAC database contains structured files which provide a common basis for communication between modules and the executive system, and can contain unstructured files such as NASTRAN checkpoint files, DISCOS plot files, object code, etc. The user can define groups of data and relations between them. A full data manipulation and query system operates with the database. The current interface modules comprise five groups: 1) Structural analysis - IAC contains a NASTRAN interface for standalone analysis or certain structural/control/thermal combinations. IAC provides enhanced structural capabilities for normal modes and static deformation analysis via special DMAP sequences. 2) Thermal analysis - IAC supports finite element and finite difference techniques for steady state or transient analysis. There are interfaces for the NASTRAN thermal analyzer, SINDA/SINFLO, and TRASYS II. 3) System dynamics - A DISCOS interface allows full use of this simulation program for either nonlinear time domain analysis or linear frequency domain analysis. 4) Control analysis - Interfaces for the ORACLS, SAMSAN, NBOD 2, and INCA programs allow a wide range of control system analyses and synthesis techniques. 5) Graphics - The graphics packages PLOT and MOSAIC are included in IAC. PLOT generates vector displays of tabular data in the form of curves, charts, correlation tables, etc., while MOSAIC generates color raster displays of either tabular of array type data. Either DI 3000 or PLOT- 10 graphics software is required for full graphics capability. IAC is available by license for a period of 10 years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes one complete set of supporting documentation. Additional copies of the documentation may be purchased separately. IAC is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer operating under VMS. IAC can be executed by multiple concurrent users in batch or interactive mode. The basic central memory requirement is approximately 750 KB. IAC includes the executive system, graphics modules, a database, general utilities, and the interfaces to all analysis and controls programs described above. Source code is provided for the control programs ORACLS, SAMSAN, NBOD 2, and DISCOS. The following programs are also available from COSMIC as separate packages: NASTRAN, SINDA/SINFLO, TRASYS II, DISCOS, ORACLS, SAMSAN, NBOD 2, and INCA. IAC was developed in 1985...|$|E
