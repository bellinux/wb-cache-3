With donations declining as donors get older, charitable marketers need to turn their attention to a younger generation.

Finally, they should encourage cooperative feeling, and curb competitive desires (Russell 1938:219–220, 222).|$|E

5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed on the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{of fraud}} and {{corruption}} were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis. A Commission officer Guido Strack reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in years 2002–2004 to OLAF and was fired as result. In 2008 Paul van Buitenen (the former auditor known from Santer Commission scandal) accused the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> independence and effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, {{during the entire}} war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, {{with the loss of}} 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units and as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> vegetation {{and the consequences of}} phosphates mining.
