5|$|White owned {{a number}} of {{antiques}} and pieces of furniture of historical interest. Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small slip <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between the handwriting of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White. White also owned a sugar bowl from Switzerland that had originated in China and {{had been in the}} possession of the Streit and White families for over two centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{actual size}} of a quarto book depends {{on the size of}} the full sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which it was printed.

25|$|Typefaces {{may also}} be {{designed}} differently considering the type <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as the ink will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which the ink will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on high-gloss cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.|$|E
25|$|The {{actual size}} of a folio book depends {{on the size of}} the full sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, {{printers}} used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46cm), and (the most common) Crown Folio (15 inches, ca 38cm).|$|E
25|$|In 1959 Anderson left Seattle for good. He {{rented a}} house on the edge of La Conner, where he found {{inspiration}} from the vast skies and natural settings of the surrounding area. He gathered rocks and driftwood, which he composed around his rustic home in various assemblages. He began painting large works on roofing paper purchased from a local lumber company. Working with large sheets <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the floor in the studio above his living room, Anderson used thinned oil paint and large brushes. The scale of the format enabled his brushstrokes to become expansive and expressive, while its texture gave unexpected complexities which he valued.|$|E

25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated him like a ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which the poet had sketched out a piece titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), pressed him to hand in his weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E

500|$|On 29 September 1638, Horrocks {{wrote to}} Crabtree about a likely {{forthcoming}} transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 (Old Style) which Kepler had not predicted.

In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, the {{original}} handwritten lyrics {{for the song}} were nearly auctioned off at Christie's in London. The sheet of notepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £80,000 at the auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to stop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home. Richard Morgan, representing Christie's, said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned the piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> which the lyrics were written. The courts decided in McCartney's favour and prohibited {{the sale of the}} lyrics. They had been sent to Christie's for auction by Frenchman Florrent Tessier, who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in London for £10 in the early 1970s. In {{the original}} catalogue for the auction, Julian Lennon had written, [...] "It's very strange to think that someone has written a song about you. It still touches me." ...|$|E
500|$|Princeton University Press {{received}} {{a copy of}} the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher’s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver [...] of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a carload <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> a siding in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. [...] The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a {{long time}} seeking a {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the floor, you could hear it fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought it would just get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E
40|$|Research on {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} growing very rapidly. The question of how long this growth process would continue may be very important to those involved in research and education on entrepreneurship. The objective <b>of</b> this <b>paper</b> is to forecast publications <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship in academic journals. Through this forecasting, we attempt not only to forecast publications <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship but also {{to shed light on}} the growth process of research on entrepreneurship. For research data, this research used online web databases. Using the data from the databases, we constructed a time series representing the number <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship in academic journals for the period 1961 - 2004. We fitted an S-shaped curve or the Fisher-Pry model to this time series data. The estimated forecast indicates that the number <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship in academic journals would grow at a accelerating rate through 2013, and the growth process would continue through 2026 at a significant rate. Then the growth rate would become marginal through 2037. Forecast indicates that after 2037 the growth may be near zero. However, the average number of publications <b>of</b> professional <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship in years 2038 - 2060 would remain at a level greater than four times of that o...|$|R

500|$|Shoin-zukuri, a new {{architectural}} style influenced by zen Buddhism, developed {{during that time}} from the shinden-zukuri of earlier Heian period palaces and the subsequent residential style favored by the warrior class during the Kamakura period. The term , meaning study or drawing room, {{has been used to}} denote reception rooms in residences of the military elite as well as study rooms at monasteries. A shoin has a core area surrounded by aisles, with smaller areas separated by fusuma sliding doors, or shōji partitions constructed <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> a wooden frame or wooden equivalents, [...] and [...] A main reception room is characterized by specific features: a recessed alcove (tokonoma); staggered shelves; built-in desks; and ornate sliding doors. Generally the reception room is covered with wall-to-wall tatami, has square beveled pillars, a coved and/or coffered ceiling, and [...] The entrance hall (genkan) emerged as an element of residential architecture during the Momoyama period. The oldest extant shoin style building is the Tōgu-dō at Ginkaku-ji from 1485. Other representative examples of early shoin style, also called shuden, include two guest halls at Mii-dera. In the early Edo period, shoin-zukuri reached its peak and spread beyond the residences of the military elite. The more formal shoin-style of this period is apparent in the characteristics of Ninomaru Palace at Nijō Castle as well as the shoin at Nishi Hongan-ji.|$|E
