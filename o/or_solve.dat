5|$|The Shapes in Space segment {{focuses on}} visual and spatial awareness, with the {{presenter}} exploring shapes, colour and everyday {{materials such as}} boxes and playdough. Musicality is explored through Making Music, {{with an emphasis on}} pitch, rhythm, beat, melody, and using a variety of real and pretend instruments. The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in the exploration of language through stories and rhymes. Puzzles and Patterns has a focus on logical thinking and mathematics, with a puppet named Jup Jup used as a tool for the presenter to complete puzzles <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

25|$|Mystery/puzzle caches require one to {{discover}} information <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> a puzzle {{to find the}} cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but {{the name of the}} location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as a padlock combination to access the cache. Finally, Challenge Caches, (a subtype of the Mystery cache) require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day, etc.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with several}} {{returning}} items from previous games, {{such as the}} Super Leaf, Mega Mushroom, Propeller Box and Boomerang Flower, several items are introduced. The Super Bell gives players a Cat Suit, allowing them to run faster, perform unique attacks and climb up walls to reach new areas. A variation of the Super Bell, the Lucky Bell, allows the player to temporarily transform their character into a lucky cat statue that awards coins under certain conditions. Another new power-up are the Double Cherries, which make a clone of the player, allowing for more effective attacks and a higher chance of survival; the more Double Cherries the player uses, the more clones that appear. Players can also wear Cannon Boxes, which fire shots at enemies, Light Blocks, which can defeat ghosts and Goomba masks, which let them blend in with enemy Goombas. Players are also {{able to pick up}} various objects, such as bombs, baseballs and Piranha Plants, which can be used to defeat enemies <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> puzzles, and ride around in a Skating Shoe or on an aquatic dinosaur named Plessie.|$|E

500|$|In later years, Rilke’s Duino Elegies and the Sonnets to Orpheus {{influenced}} Hans-Georg Gadamer’s {{theories of}} hermeneutics—understanding how an observer (i.e. reader, listener, or viewer) interprets cultural artifacts (i.e. works of literature, music, or art) {{as a series}} of distinct encounters. [...] Gadamer, using examples of Rilke's poetry in his writings, interprets these works as an experience of a divine [...] "totality" [...] that we must approach with a childlike innocence and ignorance—that only through interpreting and reinterpreting can we cope with <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> the existential problems of humanity’s significance and impermanence. [...] Gadamer points out that man is in a condition influenced by an anonymous, alienated, and mechanical world that has evolved to stand as an obstacle to his ability to make sense of such experiences.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} praised for giving players freedom to use differing methods to complete objectives {{and to explore}} the levels. Keefer wrote that in-game mechanics like the powers and equipment are not essential and did not detract from the story, [...] but served as optional bonuses in levels that can be completed with creativity and cleverness. He also said that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance, leaving the player lost on how to proceed. According to Gies, the game can initially seem unstructured from a level-design perspective, but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player can take, allowing them to experiment {{instead of focusing on}} rigid objective-driven design. GameSpot's Chris Watters enjoyed the various pathways and methods of traversing each level with [...] "compelling abilities", particularly the [...] "Blink" [...] power, and the freedom of choice which he said made Dishonored [...] "one of the truly remarkable games of [...] ". Arendt said that the game's flexibility was also a shortcoming, with certain playing styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded, preclude the desire to explore levels for further enhancements and resources. Game Informers Joe Juba also wrote that the game punishes players for taking certain paths, particularly one of violence, which results in more difficult gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending, encouraging stealth over alternatives. Kotakus Jason Schreier contrasted Dishonored with other contemporary video games, and said that where other games may require a player to find a specific solution to defeat an enemy <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> a puzzle, Dishonored [...] "feels like entering a designer's playpen", providing the player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with, or break, the world.|$|E

60|$|Summary {{of the two}} last Chapters.—There can be {{no doubt}} that the {{difference}} between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense. An anthropomorphous ape, if he could take a dispassionate view of his own case, would admit that though he could form an artful plan to plunder a garden—though he could use stones for fighting or for breaking open nuts, yet that the thought of fashioning a stone into a tool was quite beyond his scope. Still less, as he would admit, could he follow out a train of metaphysical reasoning, <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> a mathematical problem, or reflect on God, or admire a grand natural scene. Some apes, however, would probably declare that they could and did admire the beauty of the coloured skin and fur of their partners in marriage. They would admit, that though they could make other apes understand by cries some of their perceptions and simpler wants, the notion of expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had never crossed their minds. They might insist that they were ready to aid their fellow-apes of the same troop in many ways, to risk their lives for them, and to take charge of their orphans; but they would be forced to acknowledge that disinterested love for all living creatures, the most noble attribute of man, was quite beyond their comprehension.|$|E

60|$|But when he {{has thought}} of something, science can tell him whether that which he has thought of will suit his purpose or not. The {{inquirer}} or arguer must be guided by his own knowledge and sagacity {{in the choice of}} the inductions out of which he will construct his argument. But the validity of the argument when constructed, depends on principles, and must be tried by tests which are the same for all descriptions of inquiries, whether the result be to give A an estate, or to enrich science with a new general truth. In the one case and in the other, the senses, or testimony, must decide on the individual facts; the rules of the syllogism will determine whether, those facts being supposed correct, the case really falls within the formulæ of the different inductions under which it has been successively brought; and finally, the legitimacy of the inductions themselves must be decided by other rules, and these it is now our purpose to investigate. If this third part of the operation be, in many of the questions of practical life, not the most, but the least arduous portion of it, we have seen that this is also the case in some great departments of the field of science; in all those which are principally deductive, and most of all in mathematics; where the inductions themselves are few in number, and so obvious and elementary that they seem to stand in no need of the evidence of experience, while to combine them so as to prove a given theorem <b>or</b> <b>solve</b> a problem, may call for the utmost powers of invention and contrivance with which our species is gifted.|$|E
