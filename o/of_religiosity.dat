40|$|The <b>religiosity</b> and {{identity}} <b>of</b> Buddhist teenagers {{growing up in}} Britain were examined through focus groups conducted with 65 self-identified heritage Buddhists aged between 13 and 20. Findings identify components <b>of</b> heritage Buddhist <b>religiosity.</b> Antecedents <b>of</b> their <b>religiosity</b> included parents, spiritual teachers and temple training. Consequences <b>of</b> Buddhist <b>religiosity</b> {{and identity}} included work ethic, transcendental aim in life, respect for parents and diligence in school. The study suggests ways religious education teachers can accommodate heritage Buddhist emphasis of practice over belief, rejection of the term 'spirituality' and practices that go beyond meditation. It also posits {{the likelihood of a}} multi-layered conception of Buddhist identity and a shift towards 'convert' style <b>of</b> Buddhist <b>religiosity</b> while recommending closer teacher cooperation with Buddhist parents...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the association between the <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> parents and pre-adolescents, and pre-adolescents' psychiatric problems. Method: In a clinic-referred cohort of 543 pre-adolescents at least once referred to a mental health outpatient clinic mental health problems were assessed using self-reports (Youth Self-Report; YSR), parent reports (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL), and teacher reports (Teacher's Report Form; TRF) of child behavioral and emotional problems. Paternal, maternal, and pre-adolescent religiosity were assessed by self-report. MANCOVAs were performed for internalizing and externalizing problems as dependent variables, with maternal religiosity, paternal religiosity, pre-adolescent religiosity, parental religious harmony, and gender as independent variables, and socioeconomic status and divorce as covariates. Results: Internalizing problems. Pre-adolescents of actively religious mothers had more internalizing symptoms than pre-adolescents of nonreligious mothers. Harmony and gender did not significantly affect the association between maternal religiosity and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems. No associations between <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> pre-adolescents, <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> mothers, <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> fathers and/or harmony of parents and externalizing problem behavior have been found. Discussion and conclusions: Overall, associations between mental health and religiosity were modest to absent. Results {{are discussed in the}} context of a clinic-referred cohort, the quest phase of internalizing religious beliefs and role modeling of parents. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the developmental model of 2 ̆ 2 Christian religiosity(by Glock, 1962; Verbit, 1970) 2 ̆ 2 for Japanese Christian Adolescents (late adolescence: 18 - 25 years of age) of Holiness church.

30|$|The <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants}} {{has received}} the increasing attention of social scientists. The <b>Religiosity</b> <b>of</b> immigrants is important from a social perspective as well due to the massive inflow of immigrants into Western countries, who now constitute a significant share {{of the population in}} many countries and substantially affect the economy and society in their countries <b>of</b> residence. <b>Religiosity</b> {{is an important factor in}} the adaptation process and reflects on social and economic outcomes. Because religiosity has behavioral aspects (e.g., marriage and fertility), it also has long-term consequences and will affect future demographic and cultural transitions. A better understanding of the various facets <b>of</b> immigrant <b>religiosity</b> can lead to improved forecasting of these future transitions and a better preparation for the outcomes. Comprehensive databases, including cross-national and longitudinal surveys, are now accessible, thus facilitating careful statistical analyses.|$|R

In analyses of data involving both Black and White respondents, race emerges as a strong and consistent predictor of various indicators <b>of</b> subjective <b>religiosity</b> with Black Americans, indicating that they had significantly higher levels <b>of</b> subjective <b>religiosity</b> than Whites. Analyses using African American respondents only indicate that subjective religious involvement varies systematically by gender, age, region, and marital status.

40|$|In the paper, {{the author}} {{deals with the}} {{relationship}} between gender and frequency <b>of</b> (ir) <b>religiosity.</b> Bearing {{in mind that the}} finding <b>of</b> more frequent <b>religiosity</b> <b>of</b> women is almost universal within Christianity, various psychological and sociological explanations are presented and dealt with. In {{the latter part of the}} paper, the author presents empirical survey data from Slovenia. The longitudinal analysis of correlation <b>of</b> gender and <b>religiosity</b> does not indicate any trend, though fluctuations are detected. A two step cross tabulation of education, gender and religiosity points to a minimal possibility of explanation by lower education among females. Regression analysis indicates that social variables remain robust, when gender is introduced into the model. It is concluded that factors of a sociological nature cannot explain the full difference in religiosity among males and females and that psychological factors immanent to gender should be taken into account...|$|R

25|$|While Ellis' {{personal}} atheism and humanism remained consistent, {{his views}} {{about the role of}} religion in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In The Case Against Religiosity, a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition <b>of</b> <b>religiosity</b> as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Gupta Empire (c. 320–650 CE), power became decentralised in India, and Buddhism {{started to}} lose {{financial}} support from the seventh century onward.

Rural and devotional movements arose within Hinduism, along with Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, that competed with each other, as well as with numerous sects of Buddhism and Jainism. This fragmentation of power into feudal kingdoms was detrimental for Buddhism, with royal support shifting toward Hindu and Jain communities. Vaishnavism, Shaivism and other Hindu traditions became increasingly popular, and Brahmins developed a new relationship with the state, gaining influence in socio-political process, which contributed to the decline of Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|Religion {{may also}} provide coping skills {{to deal with}} stressors, or demands {{perceived}} as straining. Pargament’s three primary styles of religious coping are 1) self-directing, characterized by self-reliance and acknowledgement of God, 2) deferring, {{in which a person}} passively attributes responsibility to God, and 3) collaborative, which involves an active partnership between the individual and God and is most commonly associated with positive adjustment. This model of religious coping has been criticized for its over-simplicity and failure to take into account other factors, such as level <b>of</b> <b>religiosity,</b> specific religion, and type of stressor. Additional work by Pargament involves a detailed delineation of positive and negative forms of religious coping, captured in the BREIF-RCOPE questionnaire which have been linked to a range of positive and negative psychological outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} level <b>of</b> <b>religiosity</b> {{can be hard}} to measure, a {{majority}} of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are irreligious. This includes humans who have no religious beliefs or do not identify with any religion. Humanism is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the philosophy of religion and theology.|$|E
