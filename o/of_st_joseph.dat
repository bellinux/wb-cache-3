5|$|M-63 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Joseph</b> in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection.

It is adorned by the royal coat of arms of the House of Savoy; this conspicuous symbol of Italy was said to have helped the cathedral identify itself as Italian rather than British, and thus, remain untouched throughout the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, as the Kingdom of Italy and Empire of Japan were both signatories to the Tripartite Pact.|$|E

5|$|The Parkway begins where US20 expands to {{a divided}} highway {{southeast}} of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US20 at County Road 17 (CR17).

South of South Bend, US31 joins the Parkway, and then the Parkway turns northward along {{the west side of}} South Bend. Along this segment, US20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway. The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, the Parkway meets US12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs. From there it runs northward to end at Napier Avenue east <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Joseph.</b> The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at Napier Avenue, but US31 continues as a five-lane highway west along Napier to connect with I-94 {{and the rest of the}} US31 routing north of there on I-196.|$|E

5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Joseph,</b> the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E
