25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a self. It encompasses {{the emotional and}} intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is {{to decide how to}} choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated: [...] "There {{was never}} [...] {{faith in the}} house. I think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> being Jewish and Irish, {{despite the fact that}} I'm English." [...] He has stated: [...] "We were Christmas tree Jews", and that he is [...] "very proud of being Jewish".|$|E
500|$|During 1968, Biden clerked for {{six months}} at a Wilmington law firm headed by {{prominent}} local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, [...] "thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a Republican". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, and registered as an Independent instead.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, Alvarez said, [...] "I think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{having had}} two {{separate}} careers, one {{in science and}} one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding." [...] An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning instrument and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command. He said, [...] "I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Wintour herself, {{when asked}} about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power {{attributed}} to her. [...] "I don't think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But {{it is a wonderful}} opportunity {{to be able to help}} others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; {{there was never a}} scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E
60|$|I can't say why, {{but at that}} moment, {{in spite}} of my intense desire not to meet Césarine again, I felt I would have given whole worlds if he would have pressed me to come in spite <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> But, <b>as</b> it happened, he didn't.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} he {{stuck in his}} speech, and stared with his mouth open over my shoulder. I turned, and there was Edie, with such a merry, roguish smile, standing in the door. How proud I felt of her, and <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> too, <b>as</b> I looked at her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--I see {{you have}} been long enough in Leaphigh to imbibe some of its prejudices! It is a sad country for prejudice. I got my foot mired in some <b>of</b> them <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> soon as it touched the land. Why sir, my card is an {{illustration}} of what we call, in Leaplow, rotation in office." ...|$|R
500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a new artist in a way, because {{for the first time}} people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! that's bad. You {{ought to}} lie up in {{hospital}} for a while. I've had a turn <b>of</b> it <b>myself.</b> It's <b>as</b> bad as being blind.' ...|$|R
60|$|What {{is called}} great society, of which I {{have seen a}} good deal in my day, is now amusing to me, because from age and {{indifference}} I have lost the habit <b>of</b> considering <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a part <b>of</b> it, and have only the feelings of looking on as a spectator of the scene, who can neither play his part well nor ill, instead {{of being one of}} the dramatis personæ; and, careless what is thought <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> I have full time to attend to the motions of others.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the story}} of my origins in existentialist thought and my struggles to link it with the social work profession. I {{describe}} how my emerging spiritual understanding found affirmation in existentialist writings and increasing openness in the profession to spirituality. This process enabled me to apply the existentialist perspective in "use <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> " <b>as</b> a social work educator and direct practitioner...|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring {{to a time when}} the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E

60|$|HARRY. I'll go. Give {{me a kiss}} before I do. [She puts up {{her lips}} to his.] I'm almost ashamed <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> I'm just <b>as</b> {{madly in love with}} you as the day we were married.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just a name {{a fellow}} gave me once {{up on the}} Yukon," [...] {{explained}} Bridge. [...] "I used to use a few words he'd never heard before, so he called me 'The Unabridged,' which was too long. The fellows shortened it to 'Bridge' and it stuck. It has always stuck, and now I haven't any other. I even think <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> now, <b>as</b> Bridge. Funny, ain't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course {{all that}} changes when the {{opportunity}} comes. It wasn't so much that I disliked the idea <b>of</b> marriage, for <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> that I was proud of the freedom which I enjoyed. However that is all over. I am free no longer." ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{influences}} include Brian Wilson and Phil Spector. Buckingham {{has also}} worked extensively {{as a producer}} both for Fleetwood Mac and for his solo work.“I think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a stylist, {{and the process of}} writing a song is part and parcel with putting it together in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawn {{has studied}} meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, [...] "I don't think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I {{consider}} that my religion." [...] She also stated, [...] "It's not {{the idea of}} a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer to think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I had {{thoughts}} of seeking sanctuary in some monastery, <b>of</b> offering <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a lay-brother, to do menial work, {{and in this}} way perhaps I might find peace, and, in a lesser degree than was originally intended, the comforts of the religion to which I had been so grossly unfaithful. The thought grew and developed into a resolve. It brought me some comfort. It became a desire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is because I drink so seldom," [...] said the doctor, loftily. [...] "I hardly know the taste <b>of</b> liquor <b>myself,</b> while <b>as</b> for my friend Mr. Thomson, you might almost call him a teetotaler.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was ashamed}} <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> even <b>as</b> I spoke, {{and looked to}} see Pierre fly into a rage; but, instead, he shrugged his little {{shoulders}} yet higher, advising that I {{go back into the}} stable yard where Uncle 'Rasmus, with the hounds around him, was sunning himself, and there take advice from the old negro who claimed that where [...] "chillun an' women were mixed" [...] no good could come.|$|R
2500|$|Cartwright said, [...] "When I was younger, I {{saw myself}} as a batting all-rounder, and then I started taking a few wickets and people started saying, ‘’Oh you’re a bowling all-rounder’’ because I was out of form with my batting. So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{has been}} {{referred}} to, along with Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, {{as one of}} the [...] "new atheists", but he considers the term [...] "atheist" [...] to be problematic. He said, [...] "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, {{in the same way that}} we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a press release, Fiona {{explained}} the album's title, [...] "the ‘MF’ in the album title represents my initials, {{but it also}} gets at the many facets <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an artist and a young woman. It {{can be viewed as}} the ‘Mighty Fine Life’ in times of triumph and success, but also the ‘Mother-F-ing Life’ when I’m dealing with frustration or misfortune. I celebrate both. I feel it would be dishonest if everything was all about glitz and glamour. It’s about the balance of life, the yin and the yang, the good and the bad, all of that." ...|$|E
60|$|The man's deportment was magnificent. But for {{the fact}} that I had long ago lost all faith in him I should have felt, without the shadow of a doubt, that I had made a supreme fool <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> But <b>as</b> it was, my faith was only shaken. The hideous {{possibility}} that I had made a mistake was there like a shadow, but I could not accept it as a certainty.|$|R
60|$|He flung {{himself on}} the bench at my side, and folded {{his hands in a}} {{helpless}} attitude. 'But, Miss Cayley,' he cried, 'this is so short a notice; you give a fellow no chance; I hoped I might have seen more of you--might have had some opportunity of--of letting you realise how deeply I admired and respected you--some opportunity <b>of</b> showing <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> I really am to you--before--before----' he paused, and looked hard at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, I {{have money}} enough, {{if that is}} what you mean. My husband {{threatened}} to leave me destitute, but fear of public opinion--and I hear that he has run away, and is not well thought of now--or perhaps <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> cripple <b>as</b> I am, caused him to change his mind. But do not let us talk of that poor creature. I sent for you here for a purpose. Where is your lover?" ...|$|R
