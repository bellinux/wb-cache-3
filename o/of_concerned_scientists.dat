By contrast, the official policies and doctrines of both the United States and Russia are mired in Cold War patterns of thought.

Although nuclear war plans differ in size and detail from those drawn up 20 or more years ago, their basic structure remains unchanged. The US nuclear arsenal and doctrine were designed to deter a deliberate large-scale Soviet nuclear attack on the United States and a massive Soviet conventional attack on US European allies, as well as to preserve the option of a disarming first strike against Soviet nuclear forces.

In 2007 the Union <b>of</b> <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> said that ExxonMobil granted $16million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming, and that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{sponsorship}} of AGU by ExxonMobil became {{a source of}} concern for many members after evidence surfaced that ExxonMobil had known about climate change for decades but had actively worked to undermine climate science.

The AGU Board of Directors met on 22 April 2016 and voted to continue accepting sponsorship from ExxonMobil, arguing {{that there was not}} unequivocal evidence that ExxonMobil continues to participate in climate misinformation. Instead of making a short-term political statement, the Board wished to engage with the energy industry over the long term. In response, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Ted Lieu sent a critical letter saying that ExxonMobil continues to fund climate denial and is misleading the AGU.

40|$|Many {{people believe}} that obtaining energy from {{renewable}} sources would generate {{a large number of}} new jobs. Two reasons are often cited to support this belief. First, Providing renewable energy is more labor intensive than producing fossil fuels and nuclear power. The U. S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment (OTA, 1980), for example, estimated that deriving energy from forestry residues was 1. 5 to 3 times as labor-intensive as using coal. The Council on Economic Priorities in New York (1979) compared the job-creation potential of a solar/conservation strategy and two proposed nuclear power plants on Long Island, New York. They found that solar energy alone would create nine times as many jobs per unit of energy produced as nuclear power. California Public Policy Center (1978) similarly found that active solar systems would generate {{more than twice as many}} jobs as either nuclear power or liq ifi d natural gas. Brower and his colleagues in the Union <b>of</b> <b>Concern</b> <b>Scientists</b> (Brower et al., 1993) estimated that 200 MW of wood-fired power plants in Ohio, using trees grown locally as energy crops, would create nearly 500 more permanent new jobs in the state than if local coal were used to supply the same new generating capacity. Second, the renewable energy would increase regional self-sufficiency and local self...|$|R
500|$|In late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.

The Union <b>of</b> <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems. MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests. The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.

500|$|The Union <b>of</b> <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> (UCS) {{published}} {{a study in}} 2012 that assessed average greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. resulting from charging plug-in car batteries {{from the perspective of}} the full life-cycle (well-to-wheel analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the model year 2011 Nissan Leaf all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2009 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of miles per gallon instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, hybrid electric cars produce less [...] equivalent emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered subcompact car produces slightly less emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of [...] In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at [...]|$|E
500|$|In November 2015 the Union <b>of</b> <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> {{published}} {{a new report}} comparing two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, cradle-to-grave analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, {{are based on the}} two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite taken into account the higher emissions associated with BEV manufacturing. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars are being sold, excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets [...] in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs are being sold in the United States in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a [...] fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reason for the fact that EV-related emissions have become even lower {{in many parts of the}} country since the first study was conducted in 2012. Electricity generation has been getting cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, have undergone improvements to increase their efficiencies compared to the original models launched in 2010, and other even more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient BMW i3, have entered the market.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{hydropower}} {{plants have}} major impacts on surrounding environment. This is {{mostly because of}} flooding land for the reservoir which destroys forests, wildlife habitat, agricultural, and scenic lands (Union <b>of</b> <b>Concern</b> <b>Scientists</b> [2015]: Environmental impacts of hydroelectric power). Small-scale hydropower systems, on the other hand, {{can be used as}} a much environmental choice especially for independent rural electrification. Dam or barrage requirements for mini and micro turbines are fairly small and water is stored in forebay tanks. However, financial considerations dictates utilisation of more efficient turbine technologies than currently available small-scale turbines can offer. Cross flow turbines (CFT) of small-scale hydropower plants are highly environmental considering their production and maintenance, but unfavoured due to their difficulty in achieving adequate and sustainable efficiency. Furthermore, maintaining power quality of micro hydropower stations with island operation setup is difficult. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to investigate and identify the operating conditions of a micro cross flow turbine. A quadratic model is developed through RSM and an experimental setup of CFT is established to investigate the combined effects of flow rate, head and guide vane angle parameters on the turbine performance.
