It premiered in the United States on ABC on October 23, 2011. In Canada, CTV {{broadcast}} the series an hour ahead of ABC's debut, airing it at 7pm in most regions. The episode received mostly positive reviews and was watched by 12.93 million viewers, scoring a 4.0 rating/11% share in the 18-49 demographic, ranking first in its timeslot.

25|$|France: The {{first two}} episodes aired on TF1 on January 7, 2008 at late-night time, {{averaging}} about 3.8million viewers (28.4% share) and 3.3 millions viewers (39.4% share). Ugly Betty did really well on key demos 15–24 (First episode: 46.8%, second episode: 56.7%) and 18–49 (First episode: 39.7%, second episode: 56.6%). But {{week after week}} the show has lost more than 1million viewers, {{in part due to}} the late night schedule. In an effort to attract more viewers, two weekly TV magazines, Arthelius and Series TV Magazine, placed a cover <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty on their February 12, 2008 issues.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{two teams}} are in {{different}} divisions and did not start playing each other until after 1972, match-ups between the Bills and the Cleveland Browns occasionally get heated up due to the proximity and similarity between the cities of Buffalo and Cleveland. Like the Bills-Jets rivalry, the Bills and Browns often share bad luck and have had their share <b>of</b> <b>ugly</b> games. However, {{there have been other}} occasions when both teams have been competitive such as in the 1980s and most recently in 2007 and 2014. The rivalry also gained heat when former Bills safety Donte Whitner was with the Browns. The Browns currently lead the series 12-9, including a playoff win in 1990, though the Bills have outscored the Browns in the series.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} Yo soy Betty, la fea made by Bosnian Federalna Televizija (FTV), Croatian RTL Televizija and Serbian Fox Televizija began airing in October 2007. The {{title of the}} show was Ne daj se, Nina ("Don't give up, Nina"). After a long audition, {{newcomer}} Lana Gojak, who resembles America Ferrera, was cast {{in the role of}} Nina (Betty). Other cast members were established actors such as Robert Kurbaša, Edvin Livarić, Bojana Ordinačev, Petar Ćiritović, Andrija Milošević, Kristina Krepela and Sloboda Mićalović. The first, and only, season consisted of just over 50 episodes. Although the storyline basically followed that of Yo soy Betty, la fea, Lana Gojak's appearance as Nina seemed to be based more on the heroine <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty than on that of Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series had a number of other elements that were directly borrowed from Ugly Betty, rather than from Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series did pretty well in the ratings, but was too expensive to produce, so a second season was never ordered.|$|E

25|$|South Africa: Ugly Betty premiered in South Africa on Pay Channel, M-Net on Tuesday July 17, 2007. It {{later was}} re-broadcast on sister channels, GO and M-Net Holiday. The first season fared well with audience's {{and was a}} hit for the channel with a strong buzz around the show. Due to heavy {{promotions}} for the show across all media spectrums by M-Net, the premiere episode <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty attracted 80% more viewers than Smallville which previously occupied its time slot. M-Net marketing General Manager, Koo Govender, says the first episode was watched by about 432,000 viewers. Generally for its first season, Ugly Betty often generated 350 000 viewers with each airing, bringing in good ratings for the channel. Seasons 2 and 3 aired in the same timeslot as its premiere season; Tuesday evenings at 7:30 pm CAT, with Season 2 premiering on March 25, 2008. The channel premiered Season 3 on Tuesday January 13. In its third season the show still pulls in strong ratings similar to its premiere season keeping a consistent fan base. M-Net repeats the show on Wednesdays at 5:00 pm CAT.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} show's debut, the main characters, {{especially}} the title character, have quickly become the latest fixtures in the lexicon of pop media culture, and already they {{found their way}} onto parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations. The show's impact on issues and culture has also {{attracted the attention of}} the United States Congress, where on January 17, 2007 California congresswoman Hilda Solis (D-32nd, El Monte) saluted Ferrera on both her Golden Globe win and for bringing a positive profile to the Latin and Hispanic communities. In addition to that recognition, on May 8, 2007, star America Ferrera was honored by TIME on the magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people. The event took place at New York's Lincoln Center and the actress was recognized for defying stereotypes with the show. The success <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty and how it deals with body imaging among women in general would inspire a series of reports on Entertainment Tonight, in which reporter Vanessa Minnillo went undercover in a fatsuit to see if women were discriminated on the basis of how they look. Gay awareness groups like GLAAD have also noted the positive impact the show has had regarding Betty's teenaged nephew Justin, who realizes that he is gay.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{marks the}} end <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty. ABC {{announced}} in January 2010 that the series' fourth season {{was to be}} the last, following falling ratings. In a joint statement Silvio Horta and ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson said [...] "We've mutually come to the difficult decision to make this Ugly Bettys final season." [...] The network cut the episode order from 22 to 20, but gave the writers enough time to create a satisfying conclusion that was to air on April 14. On what he was set out to accomplish with the series finale, Horta said [...] "Primarily, I wanted it to be about Betty's journey, about Betty making it in her professional life, first and foremost, overcoming the obstacles in her past and really succeeding". Vanessa Williams said the cancellation <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty was [...] "devastating" [...] for the cast. She said [...] "Our cast was one of those rare opportunities where we love each other. It was a real shocker, and really devastating when it all ended".|$|E

A withdrawn young girl in black sits to the far right, apart and withdrawn from the other women; perhaps in defiance.

500|$|Not all of Cartier's {{work was}} so well regarded; in particular, his {{cinematic}} efforts have not achieved {{the level of}} praise of his television work. In the book America's Best, Britain's Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies, critic John Howard Reid says of Cartier's 1958 film Passionate Summer: [...] "It's hard to believe that... anyone could make such a dull movie.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was positive. Charles Webb of MTV Geek favored it over season one episodes, which emphasized [...] "generating a gag a minute within a paper-thin plot". Webb wrote, [...] "The Ugly Americans team {{has been on a}} roll much of this season, going three for three with this episode, last week's 'The Ring of Powers,' and the previous week's 'G.I. Twayne'." [...] Ology writer Josh Harrison was also positive of the episode, rating it 7.7 out of 10 and writing: [...] "'Attack of Mark's Clone' takes a pretty archetypal plotline—the evil duplicate—and translates it into the zany twisting storytelling we've come to know and love." [...] Harrison praised the episode for giving viewers insight on the character Mark, and concluded: [...] "This was a solid, if one-note, episode <b>of</b> <b>Ugly</b> Americans.

'Drive', which I favor, has no grandiose drop, just a stubborn pulse that gives the song its appealing undercurrent <b>of</b> <b>ugly,</b> tightly coiled strength." ...|$|E
