50|$|A {{dye laser}} uses a gain medium {{consisting}} of an organic dye, {{which is a}} carbon-based, soluble stain that is often fluorescent, such as the dye in a highlighter pen. The dye is mixed with a compatible solvent, allowing the molecules to diffuse evenly throughout the liquid. The dye solution may be circulated through a dye cell, or streamed through open air using a dye jet. A high energy source of light is needed to 'pump' the liquid beyond its lasing threshold. A fast discharge flashtube or an external laser is usually used for this purpose. Mirrors are also needed to oscillate the light produced by the dye’s fluorescence, which is amplified with each pass through the liquid. The <b>output</b> <b>mirror</b> is normally around 80% reflective, while all other mirrors are usually more than 99.9% reflective. The dye solution is usually circulated at high speeds, to help avoid triplet absorption and to decrease degradation of the dye. A prism or diffraction grating is usually mounted in the beam path, to allow tuning of the beam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of energy-transfer upconversion (ETU) {{on the performance}} of diode-end-pumped lasers is studied by including ETU effects into the space-dependent rate equations. The dependence of ETU rates on the mode-to-pump size ratio and on the <b>output</b> <b>mirror</b> transmission is derived. Experiments for Nd: YAG and Nd: YVO 4 crystals are performed to validate the present model. It is found that the ETU process increases the sensitivity of the output power to the <b>output</b> <b>mirror</b> transmission but its influence on the output power is not significant for low output transmission.

40|$|In {{standard}} GaAs-based oxide-confined vertical-cavity surface-emitting diode lasers (VCSELs), their transverse single-fundamental-mode {{operation is}} limited to relatively low outputs. It is {{a direct consequence of}} small radial sizes of their active regions and strong real waveguiding effects induced by their oxide apertures. Photonic crystals applied in VCSEL designing in a way shown in the present paper enable a subtle waveguiding modification leading to a considerable increase in an output of the VCSEL single-mode operation. Unfortunately, the structure of a photonic crystal damages inside a VCSEL volume its axial symmetry, which makes rigorous simulation of its operation much more difficult. In the present paper, a simplified approach to physical (optical, electrical and thermal) phenomena taking place within VCSEL volumes equipped with photonic crystals is presented. Designing guidelines to obtain single-mode-operating photonic-crystal-confined VCSELs have been proposed. Various possible distributed-Bragg-reflector (DBR) <b>output</b> <b>mirrors</b> designed for various wavelengths have been analysed.
