Rice <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> infes-tation {{in these three}} districts was detected {{for the first time}} in 2004 wet season. A set of 14 standard rice differentials representing four groups identified to characterize the prevailing rice <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> biotypes in the country were evaluated against local <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations in four locations. Based on the reaction pattern of standard differentials to <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations, the biotype 1 <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> was detected with R-R-R-S reaction pattern. The virulence composition was studied using three standard differentials viz., W 1263 (Gm 1 gene for resistance), Phalguna (Gm 2 gene for resistance) and TN 1 (susceptible without any gene). The local <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations in all the test locations expressed their virulence only against susceptible group consisting TN 1. The fe-male to male sex ratio of their F 1 was close to 3 : 1 in TN 1. These results confirmed the prevalence of genetically homogeneous biotype 1 population with avirulence to both Gm 1 (W 1263) and Gm 2 (Phalguna) genes for resistance...|$|R

The previous and current identification of these Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> relied largely upon their gall morph and host plant species that correspond to those of Japanese gall modges. The identification of these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> was considered to be mostly reliable, because DNA analysis suggested that some South Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> were indentical with Japanese <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> when thwy induce the same sorts of gall on the same host plants as those in Japan.

40|$|Parallel {{alterations}} in {{the timing of}} ovarian Ecdysone Receptor and Ultraspiracle expression characterize the independent evolution of larval reproduction in two species of <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Received: 30 July 1999 / Accepted: 23 Feburary 2000 Abstract Although most insects reproduce in the adult stage, facultative larval or pupal reproduction (paedogenesis) has evolved at least six times indepently in insects, twice in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> of the family Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). Paedogenesis in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> involves the precocious growth and differentiation of the ovary in an otherwise larval form. We have previously shown that the timing of expression of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP), the two proteins that constitute the functional receptor for the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone, regulates the timing and progression of ovarian differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Here we test the hypothesis that precocious activation of EcR and USP in the ovaries of paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> allows for precocious ovarian differentiation. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against insect EcR and USP proteins, we first show that when these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> are reared under conditions that promote typical, metamorphic development, upregulation of EcR and USP occurs in the final larval stage. By contrast, in the paedogenetic life cycle, EcR and USP are up-regulated early in the first larval stage. A similar pattern is seen for two independently-evolved paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges,</b> Heteropeza pygmaea and Mycophila speyeri. We discuss our results {{in the context of}} developmental constraints on the evolution of paedogenesis in dipteran insects...|$|R
