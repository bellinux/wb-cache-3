These techniques include the use of performance measures to define <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> <b>levels</b> tailored to different user needs, and to assure quality of service. This paper discusses the nature of NTM, its effect on the orderly delivery of existing and future services, and its potential value in developing effective telecommunications policy. It has been prepared by technologists, for the use of stakeholders in the ongoing debates that will shape the further evolution of the Internet. It does not take positions in those debates, but attempts to increase the reader’s understanding of the potential opportunities that NTM provides and steps, such as the standardization of performance measures, that could enhance those opportunities.

30|$|Queueing {{models with}} an un-reliable server under {{multiple}} vacation policy are more realistic {{representation of the}} systems. The service of the components may be interrupted when the operator encounters unpredicted breakdowns, {{and it is to}} be immediately recovered with a random time. When the repair is completed, the server immediately returns for service. Wang et al. (1999) extended Wang's model to the N-policy for an M/H 2 / 1 queueing system and focused on single-arrival Erlangian service time queueing model with an un-reliable server. Wang et al. (2004) considered an M/Hk/ 1 queueing system with a removable and un-reliable server under N-policy and presented the optimal operating policy. Wang (2004) considered an M/G/ 1 queue with an un-reliable server and second <b>optional</b> <b>service.</b> Using the supplementary variable method, he obtained transient and steady-state solutions for both queueing and reliability measures of interest. Ke (2005) studied a modified T vacation policy for an M/G/ 1 queueing system where an un-reliable server may take at most J vacations repeatedly until at least one customer appears in the queue upon returning from vacation, and the server needs a startup time before starting each of his service periods. Li et al. (2007) proposed a single-server vacation queue with two policies, working vacation and service interruption. Choudhury and Deka (2008) studied an M/G/ 1 retrial queue with an additional second phase of <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> subject to breakdowns occurring randomly at any instant while serving the customers. Further, Wang and Xu (2009) obtained the solution of an M/G/ 1 queue with second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> and server breakdown using the method of functional analysis. The work on an M/G/ 1 queue with second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> and server breakdown has been done by Choudhury and Tadj (2009). They derived the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of busy period distribution and waiting time distribution. Further, an un-reliable server queue with multi-optional services and multi-optional vacations was analyzed by Jain et al. (2013).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} an MX/G/ 1 with an {{additional}} second phase of <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> and unreliable server, which consist of a breakdown period and a delay period under N-policy. While the server is working with any phase of service, it may break down at any instant and the service channel will fail for a short interval of time. Further concept of the delay time is also introduced. If no customer arrives during the breakdown period, the server becomes idle in the system until the queue size builds up to a threshold value N(≥ 1). As soon as the queue size becomes at least N, the server immediately begins to serve {{the first phase of}} regular service to all the waiting customers. After the completion of which, only some of them receive {{the second phase of the}} <b>optional</b> <b>service.</b> We derive the queue size distribution at a random epoch and departure epoch as well as various system performance measures.

For those two policies, the expected cost functions are established to determine the joint optimal threshold values of (T, p) and (p, N), respectively. In addition, we obtain the explicit closed form of the joint optimal solutions for those two policies.
