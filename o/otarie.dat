ARTEMIS programInternational audienceHemp (Cannabis sp.) has been a {{fundamental}} plant {{for the development of}} human societies. Its fibers have long been used for textiles and rope making, which requires prior stem retting. This process is essential for extracting fibers from the stem of the plant, but can adversely affect the quality of surface waters. The history of human activities related to hemp (its domestication, spread, and processing) is frequently reconstructed from seeds and pollen detected in archaeological sites or in sedimentary archives, but this method does not always make it possible to ascertain whether retting took place. Hemp is also known to contain phytocannabinoids, a type of chemicals that are specific to the plant. Here we report on the detection of one of these chemicals, cannabinol (CBN), preserved in a sediment record from a small lake in the French Massif Central covering the last 1800 years. We demonstrate that the presence of this molecule in the sedimentary record is related to retting. Analysis of the evolution of CBN concentrations shows that hemp retting was a significant activity in the area until ca. 1850 AD. These findings are supported by pollen analyses and historical data...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the epidemiological features of hospitalizations for Crohn's disease in Public Hospitals of Paris ("Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris") between 1981 and 1992. METHODS: Data concerning hospital stays were obtained from the <b>OTARIE</b> file, containing for each hospitalization descriptive data about the patient (including sex, birth date and locality, residence locality) and the hospital (including the identity of hospital department, the route of admission into the department and discharge from the department, the main medical diagnosis). RESULTS: There was a 2. 5 -fold increase of the number of hospital stays for Crohn's disease from the beginning to the end of the study period. Concomitantly, the women/men sex-ratio increased from 0. 99 to 1. 39. The rate of hospital stays lasting less than 24 hours increased at the end of the study period, reaching 10. 6 % in 1992. Among the patients born out of the area of Paris, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients native from the North of France. CONCLUSION: The prominent epidemiological features concerning the hospital stays for Crohn's disease in Public Hospitals of Paris between 1981 and 1992 were: a) a 2. 5 -fold increase of the number of patients hospitalized per year between 1981 and 1992; b) a concomitant increase of the sex-ratio in favour of women; c) the existence of a significant higher proportion of patients originary from the North of France...|$|E
