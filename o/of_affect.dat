5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study <b>of</b> <b>Affect,</b> vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

25|$|In Mixed Feelings, Cvetkovich {{primarily}} {{explores the}} politics <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> {{in relation to}} Victorian sensationalism in the 1860s and 1870s. While she focuses mostly on traditional Victorian sensation novels such as Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Ellen Wood's East Lynne, she also looks at works that are not typically read as Victorian sensationalism. One chapter looks at George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, where she reads Gwendolen's “dramatic interiority” {{in relation to the}} affective power of sensation novels. Another reads Karl Marx's Capital as a sensationalist narrative; while most of the works Cvetkovich studies sensationalize the figure of the middle-class woman, Capital sensationalizes the male worker's body. Although Mixed Feelings focuses primarily on Victorian sensationalism, the book also contains discussions of AIDS activism and the politics <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> in relation to ACT UP.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to the {{therapeutic}} effects of stimulants can occur, and rebound of symptoms may {{occur when the}} dose wears off. Rebound effects are often {{the result of the}} stimulant dosage being too high or the individual not being able to tolerate stimulant medication. Signs that the stimulant dose is too high include irritability, feeling stimulated or blunting <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> and personality.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense depressive episodes, or self-mutilation. The information gathered through observation <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of father-offspring and mother-offspring {{similarity}} in onset age suggest that nuclear genes {{account for a}} significant portion of the modification of onset age in Huntington disease. The effects of non-nuclear modifiers are supported by the finding that the offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> women have significantly older mean ages of onset than offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> men irrespective <b>of</b> the onset age in the parent. The absence of increased father-daughter {{similarity in}}dicates that modification is not X-linked. The absence of reproductive advantage for late-onset individuals and the absence of a multigenerational maternal-lineage effect suggest that the modifying effect of the sex <b>of</b> the <b>affected</b> parent occurs in a single parental generation. Offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> women with onset between ages 35 and 49 had a significantly older mean onset age than their mothers. This suggests that a protective effect may be conferred upon the offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> women...|$|R

25|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> or {{emotion in}} the art of memory is frequently discussed.

25|$|Clinical {{psychologist}} Gershen Kaufman's view {{of shame}} {{is derived from}} that <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> theory, namely that shame {{is one of a}} set of instinctual, short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation. In this view, guilt {{is considered to be a}} learned behavior consisting essentially of self-directed blame or contempt, with shame occurring consequent to such behaviors making up a part of the overall experience of guilt. Here, self-blame and self-contempt mean the application, towards (a part of) one's self, of exactly the same dynamic that blaming of, and contempt for, others represents when it is applied interpersonally.|$|E
25|$|Organizational {{justice is}} {{conceptualized}} as a multidimensional construct. The four proposed components are distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Research also suggests the importance <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> and emotion in the {{appraisal of the}} fairness of a situation as well as one's behavioral and attitudinal reactions to the situation (e.g., Barsky, Kaplan, & Beal, 2011). Much literature in the industrial/organizational psychology field has examined organizational justice {{as well as the}} associated outcomes. Perceptions of justice influence many key organizational outcomes such as motivation (Latham & Pinder, 2005) and job satisfaction (Al-Zu'bi, 2010).|$|E

40|$|The unclear {{pattern of}} {{inheritance}} of postaxial polydactyly prompted this {{search for evidence}} of imprinting or change of expression in males and females using material of the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> offspring for 196 fathers with polydactyly was compared with that for 233 mothers with the same condition, stratified according to African and non-African ancestry. The postaxial polydactyly prevalence rate among the offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> black fathers (44 %) was larger than that in the group <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> black mothers (31 %), with no difference between affected nonblack fathers (34 %) and affected nonblack mothers (33 %). The sex ratio (. 51) observed in 631 black propositi and in 829 nonblack propositi with polydactyly (. 58) could be a further indication of etiologic heterogeneity for polydactyly between these two ethnic groups. The segregation distortion in favor <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> among the offspring <b>of</b> <b>affected</b> black fathers {{could be interpreted as}} the effect of a sex-linked recessive modifier gene acting during gametogenesis on an autosomal dominant polydactyly gene, this modifier being more frequent in Africans...|$|R
500|$|Affect is {{described}} by labelling the apparent emotion conveyed by the person's nonverbal behavior (anxious, sad etc.), and also by using the parameters of appropriateness, intensity, range, reactivity and mobility. Affect may be described as appropriate or inappropriate to the current situation, and as [...] or [...] with their thought content. For example, someone who shows a bland affect when describing a very distressing experience would be described as showing incongruent affect, which might suggest schizophrenia. The intensity of the affect may be described as normal, blunted affect, exaggerated, flat, heightened or overly dramatic. A flat or blunted affect is associated with schizophrenia, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder; heightened affect might suggest mania, and an overly dramatic or exaggerated affect might suggest certain personality disorders. Mobility refers {{to the extent to}} which affect changes during the interview: the affect may be described as fixed, mobile, immobile, constricted/restricted or labile. The person may show a full range <b>of</b> <b>affect,</b> in other words a wide range of emotional expression during the assessment, or may be described as having restricted affect. The affect may also be described as reactive, in other words changing flexibly and appropriately with the flow of conversation, or as unreactive. A bland lack of concern for one's disability may be described as showing la belle indifférence, a feature of conversion disorder, which is historically termed [...] "hysteria" [...] in older texts.|$|E
500|$|There {{is concern}} in some {{quarters}} that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat, through overgrazing and competition with native species. While exotic species, such as the Namib Desert Horse, are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park, the horses are a special case, given their close ties with Namibian history, their popularity with visitors, and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands. Studies during 2003 and 2004, however, found that while an area of approximately [...] around the watering area at Garub has {{been affected by the}} horses, there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius. The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses, probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing. Due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> on vegetation by horses, it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations. The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species, which in several cases are more threatened by human influence. As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not, the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species. The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as [...] "ghost horses", as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen. However, when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve, a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary, bringing the horses into closer contact with humans. This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia, who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds. While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia, there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions, including vehicle accidents, disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans.|$|E

2500|$|Mixed Feelings {{is based}} on Cvetkovich's PhD dissertation, which she {{completed}} at Cornell University in 1988. It grew out of Cvetkovich's “own mixed feelings about a feminist politics of affect,” [...] and argues that the effects <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> are not always liberating; rather, affect can “call attention to and obscure complex social relations, and can both inspire and displace social action.” Thus, Cvetkovich's study is a nuanced exploration <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> and politics. In looking at the figure of “the transgressive and/or suffering woman…Cvetkovich traces the construction <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> as both natural and particularly female, and as therefore potentially transgressive and requiring regulation and control.” While Cvetkovich interrogates the way Marxist, feminist, Foucauldian, and psychoanalytic theories have engaged with affect, she also draws upon these approaches in her study. Important to Cvetkovich's argument {{is the idea that}} affect should not be viewed as natural, but instead as historical.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2000, {{a number}} of authors in the social {{sciences}} and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on rhetoric and semiotics); this movement has been called the affective turn. Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility. The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, Canadian political philosopher Brian Massumi, has given influential definitions <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds. Likewise, geographer Nigel Thrift has explored the role <b>of</b> <b>affect</b> in what he terms [...] "non-representational theory".
