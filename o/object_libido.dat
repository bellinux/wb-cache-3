50|$|Jackie Stacey's {{theory of}} female spectatorship's {{relation}} with homoerotic desire has stemmed much academic debate. Opposition to Stacey's {{theory has been}} most notably come from Teresa de Lauretis. In contrast to Stacey, de Lauretis, a proponent of orthodox Freudianism, claims that the dichotomy between <b>object</b> <b>libido</b> and the desexualized ego libido that centers on narcissistic identification can not be combined or otherwise dismantled. While Stacey argues for the eroticization of identification, de Lauretis very staunchly insists that the dichotomy be maintained.|$|E
50|$|The genital stage appears {{when the}} sexual and {{aggressive}} drives have returned. The source of sexual pleasure expands {{outside of the}} mother and father. If during the phallic stage the child was unconsciously attracted to the same-sex parent then homosexual relationships can occur during this stage. However, this interpretation of the phallic stage, from the following viewpoint, is incongruous with what the primarily understood phallic stage entails. The Oedipus complex, {{which is one of}} the most significant components of the phallic stage, can be explained as the need to have the utmost of a response from the parental figure that is the main <b>object</b> of the <b>libido.</b> It must be clarified that it is more often the mother who is giving the gratification in response to a discharge and or manifestation of libido and is therefore the object of the infantile libido—not the father. It is less likely that the subject will have any unconscious sexual attraction to the father because the father is the source of the subject's incapability to possessing the mother: the subject is still focused on receiving attention from the mother. Furthermore, all sexual attraction during the phallic stage is purely unconscious.|$|R
50|$|The {{newborn baby}} {{is not able}} to {{distinguish}} the self from others and the relationship with the mother is symbiotic, with the two individuals forming a unique object. In this period, the child generates two different images of the mother. On one hand there is the loving mother, whose image derives from experiences of love and satisfaction in the relationship with her. On the other hand, there is the bad mother, whose image derives from frustrating and upsetting experiences in the relationship. Since the child at this stage is unable to distinguish the self from the other, those two opposite images are often fused and confused, rather than distinguished. At about six months of age, the child becomes able to distinguish the self from the others. He now understands that his mother can be both gratifying and frustrating, and he starts experiencing himself as being able to feel both love and anger. This ambivalence results in a vacillation between attitudes of passive dependency on the omnipotent mother and aggressive strivings for self expansion and control over the love object. The passive-submissive and active-aggressive behaviour of the child during the pre-oedipal and the early oedipal period is determined by his ambivalent emotional fluctuations between loving and trusting admirations of his parents and disappointed depreciation of the loved objects. The ego can use this ambivalence conflicts to distinguish between the self and the object. At the beginning, the child tends to turn aggression toward the frustrating <b>objects</b> and <b>libido</b> towards the self. Hence, frustration, demands and restrictions imposed by parents within normal bounds, reinforce the process of discovery and distinction of the object and the self. When early experiences of severe disappointment and abandonment have prevented the building up of un-ambivalent object relations and stable identifications and weakened the child’s self-esteem, they may result in ambivalence conflict in adulthood, which in turn causes depressive states.|$|R
