His extravagance was legendary leading to his {{becoming}} $52 million in debt in 1952 ($ in present-day terms). His love of bourbon led him to establish the WildCatter bourbon label. His excesses made him an unwilling national celebrity during the 1940s and 1950s as the media became enamored with tales of Texas oil wealth.|$|E

In 1944, Quezon died in exile in the United States and Sergio Osmeña succeeded him. The Allied Forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the Philippine archipelago, in the process, retaking territory conquered by Imperial Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade</b> and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity.

In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E
