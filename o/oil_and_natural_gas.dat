5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across {{many parts of the}} Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973.

5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas)</b> in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas}} production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's economy {{developed}} from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name. By {{the turn of}} the century, the mines employed about 150 men and producing 300 tonnes of coal each day. In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories, with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. After the war, increasing <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production gradually replaced coal production, and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.|$|E

25|$|Recently {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as <b>oil,</b> coal, <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.|$|R

In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode.

Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia in a gesture of support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region) during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.|$|E
