The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869.

5|$|Boston {{has been}} a noted {{religious}} center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts serves just under 200 congregations, with the Cathedral Church <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Paul</b> (1819) as its episcopal seat. Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters on Beacon Hill. The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is First Church in Boston, founded in 1630. King's Chapel was the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other churches include Christ Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park Street Church (1809), Old South Church (1874), Jubilee Christian Church, and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on Mission Hill (1878).|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Paul</b> and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Minnehaha Falls {{received}} pilgrimages {{from fans}} of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business {{people wanted to}} harness its power. In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls, a goal the state {{tried and failed to}} achieve. In 1888, Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Paul</b> and Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall and to build a city park there. In the 1890s, Cleveland's Minnehaha Park was annexed to Minneapolis and completed the Grand Rounds. Today Minnehaha Park sees 500,000 visitors each year. Named by Folwell, the 52-mile (83km) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast, Minneapolis to Theodore Wirth Park, to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown.|$|E

5|$|The Basilica of Saint Mary was {{constructed}} between 1907 and 1915 on {{land that was}} formerly a farm, then a zoological garden. Archbishop John Ireland supervised the planning of the church, originally named the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis, along with the Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Paul</b> in Saint Paul. He chose architect Emmanuel Masqueray, who was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first Mass was held on May 31, 1914. Church leaders desired to build the finest altar in America, handcrafted of the finest marble they could afford. It was elevated {{to the rank of}} basilica and became the first basilica in the United States in 1926. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as one of the area's finest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture.|$|E
5|$|The College of Cardinals {{originated}} {{from the college}} of the main clergy {{of the city of}} Rome. The title of cardinal initially concerned only the priests of the 28 parochial churches of the Eternal City (tituli), who were required to assist the pope in the liturgical service in the four Basilicas of Rome (Vatican Basilica, Liberian Basilica, Basilica <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Paul</b> Outside the Walls and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura). Later (probably in the 8th century) the term was extended to the bishops of the seven dioceses bordering the diocese of Rome: Ostia, Porto, Albano, Palestrina, Silva Candida (1079 replaced by Segni), Gabii-Lavicum (whose name later changed to Tusculum, and later to Frascati) and Velletri (after 1060 replaced by Sabina). These bishops (cardinal-bishops) performed the liturgical service in the Lateran Basilica. Finally, the deacons serving in the papal household or heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city (and later attached to the churches called deaconries), also became the cardinals (cardinal-deacons).|$|E

Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, he also served as {{treasurer}} of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the Returned Services League in 1965. In the early 1960s he helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Paul</b> at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier.
