25|$|In 1970, the Soviet {{space program}} re-oriented from lunar travel to orbital stations. In February 1970, Kamanin {{estimated}} first Almaz (Chelomei) or DOS-7K (Mishin) {{to be ready}} in summer 1971, at best. Selection of cosmonauts for the first <b>orbital</b> <b>station,</b> again, became a tug of war between Mishin and Kamanin, while the Air Force continued recruitment of new military pilots like Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 19 May - 19 June, Kamanin conducted the usual flight preparation and flight control sequence of Soyuz 9; health problems of cosmonauts returning from an 18-day mission caused a major redesign of future flight programs and another clash with Mishin (Mishin insisted on 30-days flights, Kamanin set {{for no more than}} 24 days).|$|E

40|$|A {{logistics}} system {{comprised of}} two <b>orbital</b> <b>stations</b> {{for the support}} of a 500 GW space power satellite scenario in a geostationary orbit was investigated in this study. A subsystem mass model, a mass flow model and a life cycle cost model were developed. The results regarding logistics cost and burden rates show that the transportation cost contributed the most (96 %) to the overall cost of the scenario. The <b>orbital</b> <b>stations</b> at a geostationary and at a lunar orbit contributed 4 % to that cost...|$|R

Each elevator has two orbital stations: the lower <b>orbital</b> <b>station</b> functions as a spaceport and tourist attraction while the high <b>orbital</b> <b>station</b> houses the elevators control facilities and provides physical access to the solar array. The partial destruction of the Africa elevator in the second season reveals that the elevators have ablative armor plates for protection against debris; purging these plates require the technical crew to jettison the counterweight at the orbital end {{in order to avoid}} the now-unbalanced elevators complete destruction. They play a critical plot role in power balance and maintaining spheres of influence by denying electricity to rogue states.|$|E
