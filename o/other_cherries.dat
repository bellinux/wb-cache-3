The festival features parades, fireworks, an air show, election of festival royalty, live music, a pie-eating contest and cherries. It is estimated that the Grand Traverse region produces up to [...] of cherries annually. The largest variety of cherry produced locally is the Montmorency cherry, or the [...] "pie cherry". <b>Other</b> <b>cherries</b> grown in the region include the Ulster, or sweet cherry, and the Balaton (from Lake Balaton in Hungary), a cherry situated between the Montmorency and Ulster in terms of color and taste.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Knight has {{recorded}} (ibid) {{the case of}} a branch of a May-Duke cherry, which, though certainly never grafted, always produced fruit, ripening later, and more oblong than the fruit on the other branches. Another account has been given of two May-Duke cherry-trees in Scotland, with branches bearing oblong and very fine fruit, which invariably ripened, as in Knight's case, a fortnight later than the <b>other</b> <b>cherries.</b> (11/6. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 821.) M. Carriere gives (page 37) numerous analogous cases, and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of fruit.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, Takenaka {{assumed that}} King cherry {{might be a}} hybrid between Prunus subhirtella var. pendula form ascendens (Edo higan) and Prunus quelpartensis Nakai (Tanna-yamazakura; perhaps a form of Prunus verecunda (Kasumizakura)) or some <b>other</b> <b>cherry</b> species.|$|R
50|$|It is {{cultivated}} for {{a number}} of purposes. The fruit is edible, being an ingredient of juice, jam, and wine, and in pickled vegetables and mushrooms. It is also grown as an ornamental plant, prized for its flowers and fruit, and pruned for bonsai, twin-trunk or clump shapes, or left upright. It is used for dwarfing rootstock for <b>other</b> <b>cherries.</b> In Manchuria and the Midwest United States, the shrub is planted in hedgerows to provide a windbreak. Under cultivation, it flourishes in well-drained, slightly acidic soil.|$|E

40|$|Field {{observations}} and laboratory tests {{were carried out}} in Harrow to evaluate the sanitary status of the Clonal Genebank collection of stone fruit. The presence of viruses and viroids was determined by ELISA, tissueprinting hybridization and GF 305 woody indexing. A total of 645 trees (197 peach and nectarine, 183 sweet and sour cherries, 106 plum, 106 apricot, and 53 <b>other</b> <b>cherries)</b> were tested by ELISA {{for the presence of}} Plum pox virus (PPV), Prunus necrotic ring spot virus (PNRSV) and Prune dwarf virus (PDV).

50|$|Prune dwarf virus (PDV) is a plant {{pathogenic}} virus of {{the family}} Bromoviridae. It causes dwarfism of leaves on certain prune and plum plants.

2500|$|Many {{cherries}} {{are members}} of the subgenus Cerasus, which is distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together (not singly, nor in racemes), and by having smooth fruit with only a weak groove along one side, or no groove.

40|$|AbstractHarvesting {{practices}} in most coffee farms in Indonesia, due to some reasons, have resulted not only red coffee cherries but also green, yellow and deep red cherries. This is suspected {{to be the}} cause of low quality coffee beans encountered by traders. This research aimed to characterize some engineering properties of coffee beans produced from wet process in respect to different colors of coffee cherries, and to especially highlight engineering properties of beans from green and deep red cherries. Non Factorial Simple Random Sampling Experimental Design was used for experiment and then ANOVA and DMRT 5 % of SPSS statistical package programs were employed to analyze the experimental data. The result of experiments indicated that some engineering properties varied among the beans from different colors of coffee cherries. The length, frontal area, weight of 1000 beans, porosity, density and true density of beans processed from green cherries, and weight of 1000 beans and angle of repose of beans produced from deep red cherries were significantly different from those of beans resulted from the <b>other</b> <b>cherries.</b> This finding suggested that the first 6 and the second 2 engineering properties might be elaborated to separate respectively coffee beans of green cherries and coffee beans of deep red cherries, from the other beans...|$|E

40|$|Most {{natural environments}} contain many simultane-ously active sound sources, thereby {{presenting}} listeners with a complex auditory scene. As with visual scenes, {{in which it}} is important to segregate objects from one another {{in order to be able}} to orient to and interact with the visual environment, the auditory scene must also undergo ex-tensive analysis before individual sources can be identi-fied and segregated from others (Bregman, 1990). Natural auditory scenes vary greatly in their content and complex-ity, and it is often necessary to focus attention selectively on a single sound source. The most famous example of an au-ditory scene that humans analyze is the cocktail party in which the voice of an individual must be separated from the voices of <b>others</b> (<b>Cherry,</b> 1953).

40|$|Eighty-one {{tetraploid}} cherry selections including {{sour cherry}} (Prunus cerasus L.) and its progenitor species P. fruticosa Pall. were compared using {{simple sequence repeat}} (SSR) marker analysis to determine the relationship of Turkish germplasm to germplasm collected from Russia and more northern and eastern regions of Europe. SSR fragments were produced with all the five primer pair cherry selection combinations. The cherry selections exhibited high levels of polymorphism with 5 to 20 different putative alleles amplified per primer pair. Primer pair PMS 49 isolated from sweet cherry showed {{a high level of}} polymorphism with 20 putative alleles identified. However, SSR analysis was not able to differentiate some selections. The Turkish selections tended to group together, separate from the <b>other</b> <b>cherry</b> selections. The Turkish germplasm did not exhibit many of the putative SSR alleles identified in the broader germplasm; however, it exhibited many novel alleles. This study demonstrates the importance of including germplasm from Turkey, an important ancestral region for sour cherry, when building a germplasm collection. It also demonstrates the value of SSR markers to identify genetic variation “gaps” within a germplasm collection...|$|R
