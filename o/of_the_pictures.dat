In this, his own paintings are pictured {{being attacked by}} ranks of Old Masters; Morning is stabbed by a work featuring St. Francis as Hogarth contrasts the false piety of the prudish spinster with the genuine piety of the Catholic saint.|$|E

Police believe Franklin took many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> which show both conscious and unconscious individuals, dating back 30 years. The photos were {{released to the public}} in an effort to identify the women.|$|E

25|$|Mussorgsky {{based his}} musical {{material}} on drawings and watercolours by Hartmann produced mostly during the artist's travels abroad.

25|$|For four of {{the trips}} a {{photography}} book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.|$|E

25|$|British tabloid {{newspaper}} The Sun {{posted a}} picture of Saddam wearing white briefs on the front cover of a newspaper. Other photographs inside the paper show Saddam washing his trousers, shuffling, and sleeping.

During this period Saddam was interrogated by FBI agent George Piro.|$|E
25|$|Cassini {{released}} the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004, {{by means of}} a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground. Although Cassini successfully relayed 350 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> that it received from Huygens of its descent and landing site, a software error failed to turn on one of the Cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures. While landing, for caution, NASA loaded Huygens with 3 parachutes.|$|E
25|$|Operation Deepscan was {{conducted}} in 1987. Twenty-four boats equipped with echosounder equipment were deployed across {{the width of the}} loch, and simultaneously sent acoustic waves. According to BBC News the scientists had made sonar contact with an unidentified object of unusual size. The researchers returned, re-scanning the area. Analysis of the echosounder images seemed to indicate debris {{at the bottom of the}} loch, although there was motion in three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> Adrian Shine speculated, based on size, that they might be seals which had entered the loch.|$|E

25|$|With emotion {{still in}} his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining the significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was}} no report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while.|$|E
25|$|Conference was {{conducted}} {{on a grand scale}} on 3 January 1968. Nevertheless, when a commemorative stamp was released to mark the Tamil conference, Annadurai expressed his dissatisfaction that the stamp contained Hindi when it was for Tamil. Annadurai also issued an order for the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of gods and religious symbols from public offices and buildings. He proceeded on a world tour as an invitee of the Yale University's Chubb Fellowship Programme and was also a guest of the State Department in the USA in April–May 1968. He was awarded the Chubb Fellowship at Yale University, being the first non-American to receive this honour. The same year he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Annamalai University.|$|E
25|$|President of the Photography club. She is {{cheerful and}} {{energetic}} and is {{constantly on the}} lookout for any good photo opportunities which causes her to regularly come into contact with the disciplinary committee and/or the student council. She {{and the members of the}} photography club run an underground website that sells voyeuristic pictures of the school's female students online by using the club's all-female members to take candid pictures of other students or set up hidden cameras in the toilets and changing rooms but Honoka later reveals that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were faked by using the club's members as models and then photo-shopping other students' faces. The site is taken down by the student council after Ui destroys the SD card that contains all their files.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use. The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Commissioner Wong {{said the}} source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> had been traced, {{but he would}} not confirm reports stating that they had been taken from Chen's computer. He added that the {{authenticity}} of the photographs was no longer in question. Wong also said of the six women found in the photographs, four were local celebrities and two were unknown to the police. None of the women were named. Wong was certain that no overseas artists were involved. He said that whilst it was not a crime to transfer the pictures to friends, those who had posted the images to Internet web pages could be in breach of the law. On 5 February, as another of the suspects was released on HK$50,000 bail, six more related photographs surfaced on the Internet. In the early hours on Chinese New Year's Eve, several hundred more photographs appeared on the Internet; there were two new faces.|$|E
25|$|Mann {{is perhaps}} best known for Immediate Family, her third collection, first {{exhibited}} in 1990 by Edwynn Houk Gallery in Chicago and published as a monograph in 1992. The New York Times said, “Probably no photographer in history has enjoyed such a burst of success in the art world.” The book consists of 65 black-and-white photographs of her three children, all under the age of 10. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were taken at the family's remote summer cabin along the river, where the children played and swam in the nude. Many explore typical childhood themes (skinny dipping, reading the funnies, dressing up, vamping, napping, playing board games) but others touch on darker themes such as insecurity, loneliness, injury, sexuality and death. The controversy on its release was intense, including accusations of child pornography (both in America and abroad) and of contrived fiction with constructed tableaux.|$|E
