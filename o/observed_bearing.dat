40|$|Abstract — Tracking sonar {{features}} {{in real time}} on an underwater robot is a challenging task. One reason is the low observability of the sonar in some directions. For example, using a blazed array sonar one observes range and the angle to the array axis with fair precision. The angle around the axis is poorly constrained. This situation is problematic for tracking {{features in}} world frame Cartesian coordinates as the error surfaces will not be ellipsoids. Thus Gaussian tracking of the features will not work properly. The situation {{is similar to the}} problem of tracking features in camera images. There the unconstrained direction is depth and its errors are highly non-Gaussian. We propose a solution to the sonar problem that is analogous to the successful inverse depth feature parameterization for vision tracking, introduced by [1]. We parameterize the features by the robot pose where it was first seen and the range/bearing from that pose. Thus the 3 D features have 9 parameters that specify their world coordinates. We use a nonlinear transformation on the poorly <b>observed</b> <b>bearing</b> angle to give a more accurate Gaussian approximation to the uncertainty. These features are tracked in a SLAM framework until there is enough information to initialize world frame Cartesian coordinates for them. The more compact representation can then be used for a global SLAM or localization purposes. We present results for a system running real time underwater SLAM/localization. These results show that the parameterization leads to greater consistency in the feature location estimates. I...|$|E
40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) {{is a human}} oncovirus {{associated with}} multiple malignancies, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Like all herpesviruses, KSHV can establish either a latent or a lytic infection in host cells. During latency the virus remains in a dormant state, with limited gene expression. After reactivation, KSHV enters the lytic life cycle, characterised by production of infectious virions and subsequent dissemination of the virus from its latent reservoir. Importantly, lytic replication is critical for KS tumourigenesis. KSHV replicates in {{the nucleus of the}} host cell and requires cellular mRNA export factors to efficiently export viral mRNAs from the nucleus, allowing their translation in the cytoplasm. But while mammalian mRNA export is linked to splicing, the majority of the KSHV genome encodes intronless mRNAs, prompting the virus to circumvent this step. KSHV therefore expresses ORF 57, a multifunctional protein essential for lytic replication. ORF 57 recruits members of the cellular human transcription/export (hTREX) complex to form an export competent viral ribonucleoprotein particle (vRNP), facilitating efficient nuclear export of intronless KSHV mRNAs. This study presents a novel mechanism for the specific disruption of the vRNP and subsequent inhibition of virus lytic replication. Results suggest an ATP-cycle dependent remodelling of hTREX, which affects the ability of ORF 57 to interact and form an export competent vRNP. Specifically, inhibiting ATP hydrolysis by the hTREX component and ATPase UAP 56 prevents ORF 57 from recruiting the hTREX complex, while key components of the endogenous complex remain able to interact. Following this finding, UAP 56 was targeted by small molecule inhibitors, using a structure-based drug design approach, to prevent ATP hydrolysis and thereby inhibiting vRNP formation. Strikingly, a hit compound identified was shown to disrupt formation of the vRNP, lytic protein expression and infectious virion production, while allowing endogenous hTREX formation within a therapeutic window, where no cytotoxicity was <b>observed.</b> <b>Bearing</b> in mind the conserved mechanism for herpesvirus intronless mRNA export, this study finally presents a series of compounds that are able to prevent both KSHV and HSV- 1 lytic replication. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{navigate}} {{successfully in}} a previously unexplored environment, a mobile robot {{must be able}} to estimate the spatial relationships of the objects of interest accurately. A Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) sys- tem employs its sensors to build incrementally a map of its surroundings and to localize itself in the map simultaneously. The aim of this research project is to develop a SLAM system suitable for self propelled household lawnmowers. The proposed bearing-only SLAM system requires only an omnidirec- tional camera and some inexpensive landmarks. The main advantage of an omnidirectional camera is the panoramic view of all the landmarks in the scene. Placing landmarks in a lawn field to define the working domain is much easier and more flexible than installing the perimeter wire required by existing autonomous lawnmowers. The common approach of existing bearing-only SLAM methods relies on a motion model for predicting the robot’s pose and a sensor model for updating the pose. In the motion model, the error on the estimates of object positions is cumulated due mainly to the wheel slippage. Quantifying accu- rately the uncertainty of object positions is a fundamental requirement. In bearing-only SLAM, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of landmark position should be uniform along the <b>observed</b> <b>bearing.</b> Existing methods that approximate the PDF with a Gaussian estimation do not satisfy this uniformity requirement. This thesis introduces both geometric and proba- bilistic methods to address the above problems. The main novel contribu- tions of this thesis are: 1. A bearing-only SLAM method not requiring odometry. The proposed method relies solely on the sensor model (landmark bearings only) without relying on the motion model (odometry). The uncertainty of the estimated landmark positions depends on the vision error only, instead of the combination of both odometry and vision errors. 2. The transformation of the spatial uncertainty of objects. This thesis introduces a novel method for translating the spatial un- certainty of objects estimated from a moving frame attached to the robot into the global frame attached to the static landmarks in the environment. 3. The characterization of an improved PDF for representing landmark position in bearing-only SLAM. The proposed PDF is expressed in polar coordinates, and the marginal probability on range is constrained to be uniform. Compared to the PDF estimated from a mixture of Gaussians, the PDF developed here has far fewer parameters and can be easily adopted in a probabilistic framework, such as a particle filtering system. The main advantages of our proposed bearing-only SLAM system are its lower production cost and flexibility of use. The proposed system can be adopted in other domestic robots as well, such as vacuum cleaners or robotic toys when terrain is essentially 2 D...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} graph-theoretic {{approaches to}} problems arising in emitter- to-platform association, {{for example in}} associating emitters and ships. The {{first part of this}} thesis focuses on emitters that are observed by two different sensors, which can only determine the bearing the observed signal was emitted from. The aim is to pair observations from the two sensors, that originate from the same emitter. In this thesis it is shown that different types of observations can be represented as one of c colours and each <b>observed</b> <b>bearing</b> as a row or a column in an n by n grid. Given the horizontal and vertical projections of a coloured grid, the aim is to reconstruct the original layout of the coloured squares on the grid. Deciding whether two sets of positive natural numbers are the horizontal and vertical projections of a coloured grid is NP-complete for two or more colours [24, 35, 47] and has close connections to colour degree matrix problems. Necessary and sufficient conditions are known for a demand matrix to be a colour degree matrix of an edge-coloured forest [9, 22]. In this thesis the first step beyond forests is taken: necessary and sufficient conditions for a demand matrix to be realisable by a graph with at most one cycle are proved. As part of the proof some directly forced structures are discovered, that is, structures that must exist in every realisation. Moreover, corresponding results for multi-graphs and pseudoforests with at most k cyclic components are presented. This part concludes with O (n 2) time algorithms to check these conditions and return a witness if one of the conditions is violated. Finally O (n 3) time algorithms to find a realisation, if one exists, are described. The second part of this thesis introduces the coloured L-model. This is an original idealised graph model, developed to explore the combinatorial properties of the emitter-to-platform association problem, referred to as the reverse radar problem in this thesis. The aim is to decide which groups of observed radars originate from the same ship, taking into account which combinations of radar models are known to be carried by different types of ships. It is shown what exactly makes finding a solution to this idealised version of the reverse radar problem NP-hard, and that there are tractable cases equivalent to finding (weighted) matchings in related graphs, which have bounded pathwidth. Restricting to graphs with bounded pathwidth is a reasonable simplification, as signals come in along bearings (i. e. along a cycle) and a cycle has pathwidth two. New algorithms to find (weighted) matchings in graphs with bounded pathwidth and treewidth are presented, which can be used to solve the reverse radar problem in this model. Finally, the likelihood and two-time models are introduced, which complement the coloured L -model by generalising measurement errors and by introducing time. It is shown that the problem remains NP-hard, even for very simple cases and some tractable cases are described. </p...|$|E
40|$|We here {{address the}} {{classical}} bearings-only tracking problem (BOT) {{for a single}} object, which belongs to the general class of non linear filtering problems. Recently, algorithms based on sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filtering) have been proposed. However, initializing particle filtering is often the main difficulty, especially if the state is only partially observed (BOT). To remedy for this problem, the problem is immersed in a modified polar coordinate (MP) framework. This approach leads us to consider an original formulation of the BOT problem within the MP system. In particular, it is shown that this problem is relevant to a more general class of problems: nonlinear filtering with unknown state covariance. Inside this particular framework, particle filters can be quite convinently initialized by using only <b>observed</b> <b>bearings</b> (optimization problem). The whole algorithm performs quite satisfactorily, avoiding the need of a strong prior about target location and velocity. Simulation results illustrate the benefits of this approach. The Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) provides a lower bound on the mean square error. Original PCRB approximations for the "partial" state target (the observable components) are derived. It is well-known that the "usual" PCRB is (very) over-optimistic. Relaxing the asymptotic unbiasness hypothesis, a new bound is derived, both for partial or complete state vectors, which presents a good agreement with estimated MSE from simulated data...|$|R
