5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish.

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
