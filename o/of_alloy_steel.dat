5000|$|For longer life, {{set screws}} are usually made <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> and case hardened. Hardened set screws often leave a plastic deformation, {{in the form}} of a {{circular}} or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the screw sets against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially [...] "making its own detent" [...] on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most set screw applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis-assembly if a bearing or other tightly toleranced part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem.|$|E
5000|$|High-strength {{low-alloy}} steel (HSLA) {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels {{in that they are}} not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between [...] Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{systematic}} data-driven fuzzy modelling methodology is proposed, which allows to construct Mamdani fuzzy models considering both accuracy (precision) and transparency (interpretability) of fuzzy systems.

This proposed modelling approach is evaluated using two benchmark problems and is shown to outperform other modelling approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is successfully applied to complex high-dimensional modelling problems for manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> using ‘real’ industrial data.
