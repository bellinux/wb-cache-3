Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During <b>one</b> <b>spring</b> practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered her thumb.

Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E

Isotope data and composition indicate that the hot-spring water is precipitation-related; its composition is modified by interaction with hot rocks, with the water following a path beginning northeast of Miri crater. Country-rock salts, probably dissolved by sulfuric acid, are found in the waters. The springs' sulfur is of magmatic origin. Hydrothermal activity has modified the rocks around Koh-i-Sultan, with Miri Kaur featuring silicified rocks and the area southwest of Miri featuring acidic alteration. Some springs in the area have a very low pH. The region is the least developed in Pakistan, and Koh-i-Sultan may be a usable source of geothermal energy; however, the lack of rainfall may make it hydrologically unsuitable for energy generation.|$|E

[...] For example, consider a river that usually rises in the spring. Suppose that, <b>one</b> <b>spring,</b> the river fails to rise. In that case, modern thought doesn't conclude that the laws of nature have changed; instead, it searches for a set of fixed, universal laws that can explain why the river has risen in other cases but not in this case.

During this period of religious concern, he determined to turn to God in prayer.
