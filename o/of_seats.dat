However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission.

Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E

40|$|Background: Every {{year about}} 1. 2 {{million people are}} killed on the worldâ€²s roads and up to 50 million are injured or {{disabled}} {{as a result of}} road traffic accidents. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt usage in reducing the severity of the sequelae of road traffic accidents is widely known. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the knowledge, attitude and use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt among commercial drivers in Sokoto Metropolis. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and descriptive. Pre-tested, structured, interviewer administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Each correct response to the knowledge questions was scored one mark and wrong response or non-response was scored zero. Results: A total of 430 questionnaires were analyzed. The mean knowledge score (%) of the study subjects was high (64. 8 Â± 17. 7). Majority (57. 9 %) of the respondents had positive attitude towards compulsory use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt. 363 (84. 4 %) of the respondents reported that they use seat belt when they drive. There were statistically significant associations between age (p< 0. 0001), ethnicity (p= 0. 02), education (p= 0. 001) as well as attendance of driving school (p= 0. 000002) and the reported use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt.
