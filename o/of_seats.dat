40|$|Background: Every {{year about}} 1. 2 {{million people are}} killed on the world′s roads and up to 50 million are injured or {{disabled}} {{as a result of}} road traffic accidents. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt usage in reducing the severity of the sequelae of road traffic accidents is widely known. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the knowledge, attitude and use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt among commercial drivers in Sokoto Metropolis. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and descriptive. Pre-tested, structured, interviewer administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Each correct response to the knowledge questions was scored one mark and wrong response or non-response was scored zero. Results: A total of 430 questionnaires were analyzed. The mean knowledge score (%) of the study subjects was high (64. 8 ± 17. 7). Majority (57. 9 %) of the respondents had positive attitude towards compulsory use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt. 363 (84. 4 %) of the respondents reported that they use seat belt when they drive. There were statistically significant associations between age (p< 0. 0001), ethnicity (p= 0. 02), education (p= 0. 001) as well as attendance of driving school (p= 0. 000002) and the reported use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt.
