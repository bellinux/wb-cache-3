5|$|One of the period's {{most famous}} buildings, the Tribune Tower, {{emerged from a}} {{competition}} held by the Tribune Company in 1922 to celebrate its 75th anniversary. The newspaper {{was one of the}} largest in the world and used the competition, in which members of the public were invited to influence the design of the skyscraper, to build a loyal following amongst its readership and generate free publicity. The final design was determined by a competition panel largely made up of the company's appointees, who chose John Howells and Raymond Hood's tower design. The resulting tower was a conservative, Gothic design and controversy about the decision broke out almost immediately: Louis Sullivan and many others criticized Howells and Hood's design as being derivative of the Woolworth Tower. Regardless of its critics, the Tribune received as many as 20,000 visitors to its <b>observation</b> <b>gallery</b> when it opened in 1925. The unbuilt second-place entry in the competition, a more simplified stepped-back design by Eliel Saarinen, also proved highly influential.|$|E

Built by the Freemasons of Chicago in 1892, {{at a time when the}} Masons was a fast-growing social community, the lavish [...] tall skyscraper had 19 stories, the bottom ten holding shops and the higher levels containing the Masons' private suites and meeting halls, some able to hold up to 1,300 people. At the top was a roof garden and <b>observation</b> <b>gallery.</b> The Freemasons were competing with their local rivals the Odd Fellows, who intended to build a much higher skyscraper, [...] tall, that they announced would be the tallest building in the world. Newspapers picked up the story, circulating facts about the size of the Temple and making comparison to historical buildings such as the Capitol or the Statue of Liberty. The Odd Fellows project failed, but the Masonic Temple capitalized on the publicity, being declared the [...] "tallest commercial building in the world".|$|E

As Małachowski was seen as associated with the reformers, Sapieha was initially seen as a conservative, although he would later switch sides and join the reformers. The doubled number of deputies exceeded the capacity of the parliament chambers, and not all of the deputies could secure a seat; public interest also grew and the entire building and the <b>observation</b> <b>galleries</b> were often overcrowded.|$|R
50|$|King-Friedrich-August-Tower, {{which has}} a total height of 28 m, has three <b>observation</b> <b>galleries</b> 12, 18 and 24 metres above ground. It was {{designed}} by Friedrich August Bretschneider jun. modeled on The Crystal Palace, its erection cost 25.000 Taler. Construction work started on May 18, 1854 after preparation of ground started on January 12, 1854. On September 9, 1854 it was inaugurated after King Frederick Augustus II had died on vacation in Tyrol just before. In 1993, it was dismantled and its parts were thoroughly restored. In 1994, it was rebuilt.|$|R

50|$|This was {{the first}} Cyberman story since Revenge of the Cybermen (1975), as {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner wanted to bring back an old enemy, but resisted using the Daleks. Before the title was changed to Earthshock, Nathan-Turner was adamant about keeping {{the return of the}} Cybermen a secret. He instructed Eric Saward not to have any reference to the Cybermen in the story's title. Nathan-Turner even had the studio <b>observation</b> <b>galleries</b> closed for the duration of recording and turned down an offer from Radio Times to provide advance publicity of the Cybermen on their cover. The success of this convinced Nathan-Turner to continue to mine the series' past continuity for ideas and old enemies.|$|R
50|$|The {{water tower}} of the workhouse is Grade II listed.

50|$|The new rathaus was in {{the form}} of a massive two-stories {{building}} with a tall tower (preserved from the previous design). Up to the fifth floor it was cover with a white marble. Over it were placed <b>observation</b> <b>galleries</b> over which hanged on the four sides of the tower a clock. A near spherical elongated dome was topping the building. The main feature of the rathaus was the session hall of the city's council. In the basement of the building once again were located rooms of preliminary detention (arrest home). During World War I in February 1915 several military engagements took place in the vicinity of Stanislawow, from which the rathaus received numerous cracks. The building itself did not fall, however it was announced to be in emergency conditions.|$|R
50|$|Visiting Egypt for {{the first}} time, {{initially}} to research and make a film about Gordon of Khartoum (though this never appeared), MacQuitty became fascinated by the attempts to save the Great Temple of Abu Simbel from the flooding that would follow {{the completion of the}} Aswan High Dam. MacQuitty's idea was to save the temples, leaving them where they were and building a dam around them, containing crystal-clear filtered water kept at the same height as the Nile water outside. Visitors would then have looked at the engulfed temples from <b>observation</b> <b>galleries</b> at various depths and from underneath. He envisaged that in time the dam would be outdated by atomic power and the water level lowered, restoring the temples to their original state. Preserving the temples by jacking them up ignored the effect of erosion when exposed to sandy desert winds. The idea was turned into a proposal by architects Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, working with civil engineer Ove Arup. However the proposal was rejected and by a massive feat of archaeological engineering the temples were raised above water level. MacQuitty's plan has always been regarded as supremely elegant and probably the best in terms of conservation of the temples.|$|R

50|$|The hull {{was formed}} {{into a deep}} lake boat pattern, {{allowing}} the ship to reach speeds not possible for a riverboat of similar proportions. The ship was designed with an eye for elegance, resulting in a graceful silhouette that lacked the boxy or top-heavy look privy to many other vessels. The layout was similar to other Canadian Pacific vessels, with three main decks (bottom-most for freight, machinery and crew's quarters, upper-most decks reserved for passenger travel and comfort with sitting rooms, <b>galleries,</b> <b>observation</b> decks, a dining hall and saloons). Okanagan boasted five dining room tables, with seating for up to thirty guests at a time, along with thirty-two staterooms and a total passenger capacity of four hundred.|$|R
40|$|Performance of face {{verification}} {{systems can}} be adversely affected by mismatches between training and test poses, especially when only one pose is available for training. Compared to holistic/monolithic representations, we show that a “free-parts ” representation of the face is less affected by pose changes, due to: a) some patches of a subject’s face retaining similar appearance across {{a number of different}} poses, and b) those patches being able to freely move position across different poses. Furthermore, we propose that this mismatch can be reduced further by synthesizing the statistical model of a subject’s “free-parts ” representation for a set of poses for which there are no <b>gallery</b> <b>observations.</b> The synthesis is accomplished by first learning how a model for a generic frontal face transforms to represent a generic face at a particular non-frontal pose. The learned transformation is then applied to each subject’s frontal model to synthesize a non-frontal model. The original and synthesized models are then concatenated in order to automatically handle multiple poses. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{passengers}} would {{board the}} ship on the cargo deck, their access {{was limited to}} the bow. After boarding they would head up either one of the two exterior staircases leading to the saloon deck. The saloon deck was home to the exquisite dining hall featuring an impressive mezzanine balcony and clerestory windows. Located at the bow was the Gentlemen’s Saloon with bar, while the stern housed the Ladies Saloon complete with a beautiful bridal suite. Above the saloon deck was the <b>observation</b> deck or <b>gallery</b> deck. This was where passengers would go to admire the beautiful view of Okanagan Lake and the surrounding area. Much like the saloon deck, ladies and gentlemen each had their own separate observation area with women observing at the bow, and men at the stern. Just beneath the Pilot House was the Texas Deck. This area served as a casual meeting place for the captain and his crew.|$|R

From the gallery visitors could be lowered into what was perhaps the Coal Palace's most unusual feature: a miniature, working coal mine beneath the main floor. Taking advantage of the sunken park, this coal mine tour was led by a mule and allowed visitors to observe the coal mining process as miners dug into actual coal.|$|E
50|$|Panorama Mesdag is a {{panorama}} by Hendrik Willem Mesdag.

From an <b>observation</b> <b>gallery</b> in {{the centre of the}} room the cylindrical perspective creates the illusion that the viewer is on a high sand dune overlooking the sea, beaches and village of Scheveningen in the late 19th century. A foreground of fake terrain around the viewing gallery hides the base of the painting and makes the illusion more convincing.|$|E

40|$|Around {{galleries}} excavated {{at depth}} in geological media, {{the creation of}} a damaged zone with significant irreversible deformation is generally unavoidable. In the case of a geological disposal system for high-level radioactive waste, the resulting change in the host rock properties in this damaged zone may potentially be important with respect to the long-term evolution and the performance of that system. In this context, predicting the extent of the so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) and, possibly, the fractures' network topology remains a challenge. This study is aimed to simulate numerically the extension of this zone at the large scale's excavation, around the Connecting gallery (HADES URL, Mol, Belgium), in Boom clay host rock through analyzing the evolution of strain localization in shear bands mode. To realistically model the involved phenomena, the concrete lining is considered on the gallery wall highlighting its impacts on the evolution of convergence and EDZ around the gallery. The focus of the current paper is made on analyzing the coupled hydro-mechanical behavior of Boom clay host rock during and after the gallery excavation with respect to the evolution of localized shear bands around the gallery. This study is accompanied by the analysis of the contact mechanism on the interface between the clay massive and the lining. The obtained results reveal some interesting features regarding the contact phenomenon relatively to the evolution pattern of shear bands within the clay around the gallery. To assess the reliability of the proposed approach, a discussion on some in-situ <b>observations</b> during the <b>gallery's</b> construction is also performed based on which a good agreement is found between the in-situ evidence and simulated results.

50|$|The coaster {{was built}} {{at the corner of}} West 10th and Surf Avenue on Coney Island, near the current {{location}} of the famous Coney Island Cyclone and at the location of the former Switchback Railway. The Loop the Loop lasted from 1901 to 1910 but was a relative commercial failure because of the low rider volume. This low rider volume was partly a function of the small cars on the coaster, and partly because safety inspectors would not allow more than one car on the course at any given time. Nor would they allow the cars to be joined into trains. The operators attempted to supplement the coaster's revenue by having an <b>observation</b> <b>gallery</b> where patrons could pay to watch others ride the roller coaster.

40|$|Imaging tectonic faults {{with small}} {{vertical}} offsets in argilittes (clay-rock) using geophysical methods is challenging. In {{the context of}} deep radioactive waste disposals, the presence of such faults has to be assessed since they can modify the rock confining properties. In the Tournemire Experimental Platform (TEP, France), fault zones with small vertical offsets and complex shape have been identified from underground works. However, 3 D high-resolution surface seismic methods have shown limitations {{in this context that}} led us to consider the detection and characterization of the faults directly from underground works. We investigate here the potential of seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) applied in a transmission configuration to image the clay-rock medium in a horizontal plane between galleries, and compare it with first-arrival traveltime tomography (FATT). Our objective is to characterize seismic velocities of a block of argilittes crossed by a subvertical fault zone with a small vertical offset. The specific measurement configuration allows us to neglect the influence of the galleries on the wave propagation and to simplify the problem by considering a 2 D isotropic horizontal imaging domain. Our FWI scheme relies on a robust adaptation of early-arrival waveform tomography. The results obtained with FATT and FWI are in accordance and both correlate with the geological <b>observations</b> from the <b>gallery</b> walls and boreholes. We show that even though various simplifications are done in the inversion scheme and only a part of the data is used, FWI allows to get higher resolution images than FATT, and is especially less sensitive to the incomplete illumination as it uses also diffracted energy. The results provided in this study highlight the complexity of the fault zone, showing a complex interaction of the main fault system with a secondary system composed of decimetric fractures associated with the presence of water...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on museum and art gallery visits by schools {{draws attention to}} the fact that schools and other educational institutions may perceive the art gallery as a place for learning and education whilst other groups in society do not. The literature also draws attention to internal and external factors related to the school and art gallery context which may contribute to the intended and unintended outcomes of art gallery visits by schools. To date, no research has been conducted into the effects of a single visit to the Art Gallery of Western Australia (ACWA) en secondary art students. Art teachers and Gallery education officers have regularly used the Art Gallery as an educational resource for students yet have received little or no feedback on the worthwhileness of visits or students 2 ̆ 7 experiences in the Gallery.

The building itself, like the other public buildings of Manchester, is most dignified, and the great hall of the exchange is very noble. I would not, if I could, have repressed a thrill of pride in seeing our national colors and emblems equalled with those of Great Britain {{at one end of}} the room, but these were the only things American in the impression left. We made our way through the momently thickening groups on the floor, and in the guidance of a member of the exchange found a favorable point of <b>observation</b> in the <b>gallery.</b> From this the vast space below showed first a moving surface of hats, with few silk toppers among them, but a multitude of panamas and other straws. The marketing was not carried on with anything like the wild, rangy movement of our Stock Exchange, and the floor sent up no such hell-roaring (there is no other phrase for it) tumult as rises from the mad but not malign demons of that most dramatic representation of perdition. The merchants, alike staid, whether old or young, congregated in groups which, dealing in a common type of goods, kept the same places till, toward three o'clock, they were lost in the mass which covered the floor. Even then there was no uproar, no rush or push, no sharp cries or frenzied shouting; but from the crowd, which was largely made up of elderly men, there rose a sort of surd, rich hum, deepening ever, and never breaking into a shriek of torment or derision. It was not histrionic, and yet for its commercial importance it was one of the most moving spectacles which could offer itself to the eye in the whole world.|$|R
