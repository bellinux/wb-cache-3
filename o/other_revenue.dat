40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to those held in the Database at Leicester in the directory /obrien/*. *. These data on English revenues, 1485 - 1815, have been prepared by Professor P. K. O'Brien, Director of the Institute for Historical Research and by Dr P. A. Hunt. Discussion of the English fiscal data in this period can most conveniently be found in Professor O'Brien's chapter in Bonney, The rise of the fiscal state in Europe, forthcoming, 1994.
