5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus {{are capable of}} {{producing}} lightning much like the clouds on Earth. The existence of lightning had been controversial outside of the former Soviet Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006–2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is at least half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Earth.|$|E

The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes.

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} age of any surface feature can {{be determined}} from the density of impact crater on it.

The crater density is same on the ejecta covered plains outside the basin. The smooths plains and hummocky plains also have the same crater density and therefore the same apparent age. The low crater density indicates that Raditladi is much younger than Caloris—it may have formed within the last billion years, whereas the age of Caloris is 3.5–3.9 billion years.|$|E

25|$|SA-2 Samson is a twin-ducted fan VTOL utility aircraft, {{similar in}} role and {{appearance}} to the real-world UH-60 Black Hawk, Mi-8 or UH-1 Huey utility helicopters. It is armed with two door mounted {{machine guns and}} two pylons near the cockpit with missile pods mounted on them. The pair of ducted-fan assemblies, each with two coaxial propellers, enable the Samson of 6,000 kilograms lifting capability by manufacturers specifications, but lifting performance is rated at 150% <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Pandora due to the thicker atmosphere. Both ducted-fan assemblies are capable of changing blade pitch independently. From the pilot perspective, forward and aft, lift, yaw and roll authority are accomplished by similar sets of controls found in conventional helicopters. Propulsion is twin Goetz-Korman turbine generators.|$|E
25|$|The first {{announcement}} of a planet around the star was Gliese 581b discovered by astronomers at the Observatory of Geneva in Switzerland and Grenoble University in France. Detected in August 2005 and using extensive data from the ESO/HARPS spectrometer it was the fifth planet to be discovered around a red dwarf. Further observations by the same group resulted in the detection of two more planets, Gliese 581c and Gliese 581d.) in a 3-planet system |url=http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/udry_preprint.pdf |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters |volume=469 |issue=3 |pages=L43–L47 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20077612|bibcode=2007A |arxiv=0704.3841 |format=PDF }} The orbital period of Gliese 581d was originally thought to be 83 days but was later revised to a lower value of 67 days. The revised orbital distance would place it at the outer limits of the habitable zone, the distance at which it is believed possible for liquid water to exist {{on the surface of}} a planetary body, given favourable atmospheric conditions. Gliese 581d was estimated to receive about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Earth, though if high levels of carbon dioxide are present in the planetary atmosphere, the greenhouse effect could keep temperatures above freezing.|$|E

500|$|Thunderstorms, {{evidenced}} by flashes of lightning, on Jupiter {{have been detected}} and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice, suggesting that a similar mechanism may act as on Earth. (Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge, so {{it is capable of}} creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning.) These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the Earth. The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior. [...] The clouds of Venus may also be capable of producing lightning; some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Earth.|$|E
