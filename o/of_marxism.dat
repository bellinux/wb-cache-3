5|$|Trotsky {{opened a}} public debate with Shachtman and Burnham and {{developed}} his positions {{in a series}} of polemics written in 1939–1940 and later collected in In Defense <b>of</b> <b>Marxism.</b> Shachtman and Burnham's tendency resigned from the International in early 1940, alongside almost 40% of the SWP's members, many of whom became founder members of the Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version <b>of</b> <b>Marxism,</b> was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E

We believe that it can better cultivate socialist builders to achieve the Chinese dream by playing the educational function of Ideological and Political Theory Course. </p...|$|R

50|$|Two {{variants}} <b>of</b> orthodox <b>Marxism</b> are impossibilism and Anti-Revisionism. Impossibilism {{is a form}} <b>of</b> orthodox <b>Marxism</b> {{that both}} rejects the reformism <b>of</b> revisionist <b>Marxism</b> and opposes the Leninist theories of imperialism, vanguardism and democratic centralism (which argue that socialism can be constructed in underdeveloped, quasi-feudal countries through revolutionary action {{as opposed to being}} an emergent result of advances in material development). An extreme form of this position is held by the Socialist Party of Great Britain. The Anti-Revisionist tradition, in contrast, criticised official Communist parties from the opposite perspective, as having abandoned the orthodox <b>Marxism</b> <b>of</b> the founding fathers.|$|R
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants <b>of</b> <b>Marxism,</b> and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
5|$|Manchester has {{a notable}} {{place in the}} history <b>of</b> <b>Marxism</b> and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels {{spent much of his}} life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The {{economics}} books Marx was reading at the time {{can be seen in the}} library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, he was {{employed}} by the Ordnance Survey. In this position he toured Britain to plot the location of archaeological sites in the landscape, in the process identifying several previously unknown sites. Increasingly interested in aerial archaeology, he obtained aerial photographs produced by the Royal Air Force and identified {{the extent of the}} Stonehenge Avenue, excavating it in 1923. With the archaeologist Alexander Keiller, he conducted an aerial survey of many counties in southern England and raised the finances to secure the land around Stonehenge for The National Trust. In 1927, he established the scholarly journal Antiquity, which contained contributions from many of Britain's most prominent archaeologists, and in 1939 he {{served as president of the}} Prehistoric Society. An internationalist and socialist, he came under the influence <b>of</b> <b>Marxism</b> and for a time became a Soviet sympathiser. During the Second World War he worked with the National Buildings Record, photographically documenting Southampton. After retiring in 1946, he refocused his attention on Sudanese archaeology and wrote several further books prior to his death.|$|E

5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar <b>of</b> <b>Marxism,</b> was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique <b>of</b> <b>Marxism,</b> the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

25|$|Alexandru Claudian (also {{rendered}} as Al. Claudian; April 8, 1898 – October 16, 1962) was a Romanian sociologist, political figure, and poet. A {{student and}} practitioner <b>of</b> <b>Marxism,</b> {{he worked as}} a schoolteacher, entry-level academic, field researcher, and journalist, before finally earning a professorship at Iași University. An anti-fascist, Claudian enlisted with the Romanian Social Democratic Party during the interwar, moving closer to the anti-communist center by the late 1940s, and became that faction's main theoretician. His condemnation <b>of</b> <b>Marxism</b> and totalitarianism made him an enemy of the communist regime, which imprisoned him for several years and kept him under surveillance until the time of his death.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling {{the paper on}} street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence <b>of</b> <b>Marxism</b> and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination <b>of</b> <b>Marxism</b> in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised {{to him when he}} took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met her for the first time. After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.|$|E
