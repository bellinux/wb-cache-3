5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering,</b> of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel steering mechanism {{embedded in a}} point-the-bit rotary steerable system (RSS) for oilfield exploitation. <b>The</b> new <b>steering</b> mechanism adopts a set of universal joints to alleviate the high alternative strain on drilling mandrel and employs a specially designed planetary gear small tooth number difference (PGSTD) to achieve directional steering. Its principle and characteristics are explained and examined through a series <b>of</b> analyses. First, <b>the</b> eccentric displacement vector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offset point on the drilling mandrel is formulated and kinematic solutions are established. Next, structural design for <b>the</b> new <b>steering</b> mechanism is addressed. Then, procedures and program architectures for simulating offset state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilling mandrel and motion trajectory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>steering</b> mechanism are presented. After that, <b>steering</b> motion simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>steering</b> mechanism for both 2 D and 3 D well trajectories are then performed by combining LabVIEW and SolidWorks. Finally, experiments on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> motion control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>steering</b> mechanism prototype are carried out. The simulations and experiments reveal that <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>steering</b> mechanism is satisfied. The research can provide good guidance for further research and engineering application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point-the-bit RSS...|$|R

5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself.

Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated.

5|$|The {{interaction}} of a vigorous tropical wave and a disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{led to the}} formation of a tropical depression about 520mi (835km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde by 18:00UTC on August21. Steered by a ridge to its north, the depression steadily organized as it moved west-northwest, intensifying into Tropical Storm Danielle by 06:00UTC on August22 and attaining hurricane intensity the following day. Influenced by moderate wind shear initially, Danielle maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for several days. Early on August26, however, a more conducive environment led to rapid intensification, and by 18:00UTC the next day, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). Danielle began to round the western periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> ridge after peak intensity, curving northeast as it began an eyewall replacement cycle. The inner core change, combined with progressively cooler waters, resulted in the system weakening to a tropical storm by 18:00UTC on August30 and degenerating into a remnant low six hours later. The low became extratropical on August31 maintained distinct until dissipating well east-southeast of Greenland on September3.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we address}} <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> how bipartite steering violation takes place among multipartite systems (where each sub-system having Hilbert space dimension restricted to two) based on <b>the</b> maximal violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bipartite <b>steering</b> inequality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced pairwise qubit systems. We have derived a trade-off relation which is satisfied by those pair wise bipartite maximal steering violations, which physically {{can be understood}} as providing restrictions on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> among sub systems. For a three-qubit system, it is impossible that all pairs <b>of</b> qubits violate <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> inequality, and once a pair <b>of</b> qubits violates <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> inequality maximally, <b>the</b> other two pairs of qubits must both obey <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> inequality. We also present a complementarity relation between genuine entanglement present in a tripartite state and maximum bipartite steering violation by reduced states.
