Two cases are used: A numerical analysis on the capillary instabilities and breakup processes <b>of</b> a cylindrical <b>liquid</b> column and a moving liquid sheet in a moving gaseous medium to analyze the dynamics and breakup <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> sheet. The problem, composed of the Navier-Stokes systems associated with surface tension forces, is solved by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique with a Continuum Surface Force (CSF) to artificially smooth the discontinuity present at the interface. The results show that before disintegration <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> the capillary waves become unstable {{and the source of}} making the wave unstable is inherently developed by the system. The investigation <b>of</b> moving <b>liquid</b> sheet showed that the two modes <b>of</b> forces for <b>liquid</b> stretching exists: shear force causing the stretching <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> by shear velocity and drag force causing the stretching <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> by gas velocity ahead of the tip <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> sheets.
