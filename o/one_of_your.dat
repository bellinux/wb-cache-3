25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

500|$|Mostly in {{the early}} seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a {{recurring}} joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is.

500|$|Terlecki's answers at {{this meeting}} under the {{questioning}} of General Ryba, a former military prosecutor, were typically provocative; when the general asked what time Terlecki had left the hotel on 29 November, the ŁKS forward said 08:00.

500|$|Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane {{returned}} to New York {{to preside over}} hearings (begun on the Commission's own initiative) into oil pipelines. [...] While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company, he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who, though secretary of several pipeline companies, could not say who authorized the sales. [...] "I don't {{want to deal with}} a clerk or <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> $5,000 a year men. I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority." [...] The Commission held that oil pipelines were common carriers, and ordered the companies owning them to file rate schedules and otherwise comply with the Interstate Commerce Act.|$|E
500|$|Steinitz rated Anderssen {{as one of}} the two {{greatest}} attacking {{players of}} his time: [...] "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough." [...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
500|$|In 1881 Ayres {{worked as}} a {{household}} assistant to Edward Woakes, a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders. By 1885 {{she had become a}} household assistant and nursemaid to the Chandlers, living with the family. After her death, Ayres was described by a local resident as [...] "not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fast sort—gentle and quiet-spoke, and always busy about her work". Another neighbour told the press that [...] "no merry making, no excursion, no family festivity could tempt her from her self-imposed duties. The children must be bathed and put to bed, the clothes must be mended, the rooms must be 'tidied up', the cloth must be laid, the supper carefully prepared, before Alice would dream of setting forth on her own pleasures".|$|E

500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which {{do you want me}} to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E
500|$|A Lesson in Romantics is {{considered}} a fan favorite. Daniel Thompson of Music Emissions wrote that: [...] "every song is spectacular on this album and is a potential hit." [...] Despite its eventual success and acclaim, A Lesson In Romantics received little attention from professional music critics. Reviewers noted the improved sound from the band's debut EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends. Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk.net wrote that: [...] "after their unimpressive release of the EP Tales Told By Dead Friends in November, the band's back with their debut album that will surely become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> most played of the Summer." [...] Sputnikmusic reviewer Adam Knott gave the album a score of 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a {{hell of a lot}} better" [...] than most pop punk records.|$|E
500|$|Como {{competed with}} Jackie Gleason {{in what was}} billed as the [...] "Battle of the Giants" [...] and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como {{commonly}} downplayed his own achievements, and also because {{the two men were}} friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle's mother was thrilled. Como's words to Gleason after the visit, [...] "Anything you want, you got it. In fact, I'll even do <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> shows so the ratings will be better." [...] Como was among those who filled in for Gleason on The Jackie Gleason Show in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an on-air fall.|$|E

500|$|Affleck {{subsequently}} starred as an autistic accountant in {{the action}} thriller The Accountant. The film was a commercial success, greatly exceeding box office expectations. Peter Debruge of Variety felt Affleck's [...] "boy-next-door" [...] demeanour– [...] "so normal and non-actorly {{that most of his}} performances feel like watching <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> buddies up on screen"– was [...] "a terrific fit" [...] for the role. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why Affleck, [...] "looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable," [...] committed himself to the film. Live by Night, which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of The Atlantic described it as [...] "a fascinating mess of a movie" [...] and criticized Affleck's [...] "stiff, uncomfortable" [...] performance. But he noted that one of the last action scenes [...] "is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the Good Will Hunting screenplay at New York's Skirball Theater.|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like he went out and told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E
