5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote an <b>open</b> <b>letter</b> {{at the request}} of Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith. This was followed by an <b>open</b> <b>letter</b> to the pope (Admonitio paterna Pauli III) in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio in 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith.|$|E

Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E
