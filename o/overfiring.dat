50|$|However, {{in animal}} experiments, saclofen is paradoxically {{observed}} {{to have an}} antiepileptic effect. This is probably because GABAB effect is coupled to excitation in the thalamo-cortical circuits — Kir coupling via Gβγ subunits {{is so strong that}} it lowers the threshold for T-type Ca2+ channel opening enough to elicit their opening, and thus an excitation in this circuit. Since thalamo-cortical circuit <b>overfiring</b> is seen in types of epilepsy involving absence seizures (ethosuximide, a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker, is used in the treatment of this), the unexpected antiepileptic effects of saclofen may thus be explained (unexpected as the GABA receptors are inhibitory, and antagonizing them should lead to hyperactivity of the affected neurons). Possible therapeutic uses of saclofen are currently being researched.|$|E

It is not recommended to leave the air control fully open, except when helping the chimney/flue heat up initially. A fully open air control {{will lead to more}} heat being sent straight up the chimney rather than into the room (which reduces efficiency). The biggest problem with leaving the air control fully open is “overfiring”. <b>Overfiring</b> is caused when too much heat is generated within the fire chamber, which will lead to warping, buckling and general damage to the stove and its internal components.

Test conditions ranged from highly buoyant pool-like flames to buoyant jet flames, using three burners (with exit diameters of 5, 50, and 234 mm) {{and a wide}} range of fuel flow rates. Soot generation efficiencies (the percentage of fuel carbon converted to soot and emitted from the flame) were uniform throughout the <b>overfire</b> region for a given flame condition. Soot generation efficiencies increased with increasing flame residence times but tended to approach asymptotic values for residence times roughly ten times longer than residence times at the normal smoke point. Within the asymptotic region, soot volume fractions are directly related to mixing levels, analogous to the laminar flamelet concept for nonpremixed flames, which offers substantial simplifications for analysis of the continuum radiation properties of the <b>overfire</b> region...|$|R

The assignments were: {{reducing the number of}} CO-spikes and tuning the <b>overfire</b> air control loop. To reduce the number of CO-spikes the possibility that skewness in mass distribution affects the number of CO-spikes were study. The skewnwss of mass distribution was controled and adjusted with two experiments. The conclusion that was made is that the skewness of mass distribution were not sufficient enough to affect the number of CO-spikes. Most likely because there are other factor that affects the number of CO-spikes more than the skewness of mass distribution. The objective with tuning the <b>overfire</b> air control loop was to find a faster and better interplayed control loop. To solve the assignment the first thought was to make a model of the furnace. But this idea was too much work for a single master thesis. Therefore a Simulink-model and a control strategy were produced instead. During the work with tuning the <b>overfire</b> air control loop the changes were issued from the control strategy and the Simulink-model were used for the tuning of the air valves.

The sintering behaviour was evaluated {{by means of the}} variation of shrinkage degree, bulk density, water absorption, open and closed porosity, while the phases transformation were investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results have shown that the sintering process follows a viscous liquid phase mechanism due to the formation of a glassy phase. The optimum sintering temperature is 1125 ºC for Astilleros and Cuchia sediments and 1150 ºC for Raos sample.

In additions, millimeter-wave sintering (24 GHz, mS) process enhances the densification kinetics and grain growth behavior more efficiently than the microwave sintering (2. 45 GHz, mS) process, resulting in better varistor characteristics for ZnO materials. However, sintering by millimeter-wave for too long period induces <b>overfiring</b> of the samples, which results in a density reversion phenomenon.

40|$|The {{most common}} type of {{container}} glass which is landfilled in the UK is soda-limesilica glass, comprising typically 7 I- 75 wt% silica, 12 -I 6 wt% soda and 1 O- 15 wt% lime. Considering its chemical similarity to that of the fluxing materials commonly used in whiteware bodies, it is sensible to investigate the use of SLS waste glass as replacement for these fluxes in whitewares. The present study aimed at the incorporation of colourless SLS waste glass into a standard whiteware formulation (Le. 50 wt% kaolinite clay, 25 wt% quartz and 25 wt% nepheline syenite) as a flux, and at the examination of the microstructural development on firing. Bulk samples with two (e. g. clay and quartz, SLS glass and clay, etc.), three (standard and fully SLS-fluxed whiteware) and four (mixed nepheline syenite SLS glass as flux system) components were studied in depth. After firing 3 h at 1100 Ã‚Â°C, batches containing 6. 25 wt% SLS glass and 18. 75 wt% nepheline syenite attained open-pore closure and a bulk density of 2. 40 g/cm 3, comparable to that of the standard body fired at 1200 Ã‚Â°C. SLS glass softens and melts, conferring early densification and <b>overfiring</b> on whitewares fired at commercially-applied firing temperatures. Severe bloating ruled out the use of higher amounts of SLS glass. The microstructural evolution examined using XRD, SEMlEDS, and TEMIEDS revealed the formation of a variable composition plagioclase, wollastonite, and cristobalite in batches containing SLS glass, in addition to primary and secondary mullites, partially dissolved quartz, and a glassy matrix as found in the standard whiteware. Na+ and Ca 2 +ions from SLS glass migrate towards clay mineral relicts to form plagioclase, limiting the extent of mullite crystallization in SLS containing batches. Wollastonite and cristobalite crystallize from the devitrification of SLS glass. The flexural strength of the body containing 6. 25 wt% SLS glass fired at 1 l 00 Ã‚Â°C (- 71. 2 MPa) was higher, modulus of elasticity slightly lower, and fracture toughness comparable to those of the standard whiteware body fired at 1200 Ã‚Â°C. The Weibull modulus of the partially SLS-fluxed whiteware was lower due to the presence of crystals inhomogeneously distributed over a complex microstructure. From the physical and mechanical properties investigated in this study, SLS glass can be used as part of the fluxing system of some fully densified whitewares.

In September 1990, Southern Company Services entered into an agreement to conduct the study, with Gulf Power Company providing the 180 megawatt electric (MWe) host site and ABB C-E Services Inc. providing the technology to be demonstrated. This project was undertaken to evaluate the nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) reduction potential of several variations of the Low NO{sub x} Concentric Firing System (LNCFS{trademark}) when applied to tangentially fired (T-fired) boilers. The project consisted of replacing the existing coal and air nozzles with new nozzles and adding <b>overfire</b> air. Three versions of the LNCFS system were tested: Level 1 consisted of new coal nozzles and close-coupled <b>overfire</b> air; Level 2 used the same burners but separated the <b>overfire</b> air; and Level 3 used both close-coupled and separated <b>overfire</b> air. The performance objectives were as follows: (1) to determine the short-term and long-term NO{sub x} emissions reduction capabilities and impact on unit performance of the low-NO{sub x} combustion technologies of LNCFS Levels 1, 2, and 3 when implemented in a stepwise manner on a T-fired boiler operating under normal dispatch conditions, the NO{sub x} reduction objective was 50 %; (2) to compare the performance and cost effectiveness of these technologies; and (3) to determine the relationship between operating parameters (e. g., unit load, percent <b>overfire</b> air) and NO{sub x} emissions and other unit performance indicators, such as unburned carbon, carbon monoxide (CO) level, and air toxics.

40|$|LecturePg. 69 - 80 The thrust herein is to {{encourage}} more people to take transient data during startups and rundowns. The common complaint is that it takes too much {{time and effort to}} prepare for this information. That argument is "weak" within today's instrumentation capabilities. Further, the more forms of information on the same transient data gives the person saddled with the responsibility of eliminating the problem a better confidence level in the final conclusion. The rotor system, whatever its configuration, forces all the system's responses during the run up and rundown. The ability to look at plots of time waveforms, orbits, polars, Bode plots, cascades, eccentricities, spectra, raw vs synchronous vs compensated information can be valuable. The ability to define accurately the "resonances" in the system and the corresponding ability to direct logical in-situ balancing. The ability to identify rubs when they occur. The initiation of "instabilities" is near breathtaking. The ability to correlate running speed vibration values vs subrotative (whirl or whip) values can be very meaningful and normally with unexpected results, i. e., qualifying the "damping" or "lack of' in a system. In all this, the FM tape recorder should never be overlooked; however, the digital storage capability with computer attached is extremely powerful and simple to manipulate. Speed tracking offers the ability of saving memory during operational delays, as the next speed threshold has not been reached. Three case histories are used to illustrate the advantages of transient measure. The three descend in "actual data" presented to simplify the process. The more complicated/involved issue is addressed first, and it is a 22 MW compressor turbine gas generator, power turbine, generator system. This equipment suffered from <b>overfiring</b> the combustors, over acceleration, and over heating the gas turbine system, rubs on compressor blades and heavy destructive rubs on hot turbine shroud bands. The unit whirls and whips. For about 18 hr after repairs, it suffered other problems of "surge/stall" due to IGV control problems (not covered in this text). The second case discusses a simple low horsepower, medium speed, five stage back pressure steam turbine with problems which existed for over one and one-half years. The basic trending, which showed varying amplitudes and phase, just simply did not define the problem. One set of transient startup/shutdown data on the soloed turbine brought to bear, "quickly," the main problem. Several options were open for correction; the simplest was performed, and the problem totally eliminated. Further, stress corrosion cracking failures were better understood under high stress. The third is a very complicated hot gas turbine single shaft, expander compressor steam turbine, unit. It goes through three (two rigid and one bending) criticals (=resonances) to reach an operating speed of - 18, 000 rpm. The failure of the first wreck is better investigated via transient data. The rebuilding and rebalancing involved is better understood. The comparison through a "resonant whirl" region that allowed correction is better understood.

40|$|Energy and Environmental Research Corporation is {{developing}} a family of high efficiency and low cost NO{sub x} control technologies for coal fired utility boilers based on Advanced Reburning (AR), a synergistic integration of basic reburning with injection of an N-agent. In conventional AR, injection of the reburn fuel is followed by simultaneous N-agent and <b>overfire</b> air injection. The second generation AR systems incorporate several components {{which can be used}} in different combinations. These components include: (1) Reburning Injection of the reburn fuel and <b>overfire</b> air. (2) N-agent Injection The N-agent (ammonia or urea) can be injected at different locations: into the reburning zone, along with the <b>overfire</b> air, and downstream of the <b>overfire</b> air injection. (3) N-agent Promotion Several sodium compounds can considerably enhance the NO{sub x} control from N-agent injection. These ''promoters'' can be added to aqueous N-agents. (4) Two Stages of N-agent Injection and Promotion Two N-agents with or without promoters can be injected at different locations for deeper NO{sub x} control. AR systems are intended for post-RACT applications in ozone non-attainment areas where NO{sub x} control in excess of 80 % is required. AR will provide flexible installations that allow NO{sub x} levels to be lowered when regulations become more stringent. The total cost of NO{sub x} control for AR systems is approximately half of that for SCR. Experimental and kinetic modeling results for development of these novel AR systems are presented. Tests have been conducted in a 1. 0 MMBtu/hr Boiler Simulator Facility with coal as the main fuel and natural gas as the reburning fuel. The results show that high efficiency NO{sub x} control, in the range 84 - 95 %, can be achieved with various elements of AR. A comparative byproduct emission study was performed to compare the emissions from different variants of AR with commercial technologies (reburning and SNCR). For each technology sampling included: CO, SO{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }O, total hydrocarbons, NH{sub 3 }, HCN, SO{sub 3 }, fly ash mass loading and size distribution, PM 10, and carbon in ash. AR technologies do not generate significant byproduct emissions in comparison with basic reburning and SNCR processes under similar conditions. In most cases, byproduct emissions were found to be lower for the AR technologies. Kinetic modeling predictions qualitatively explain the experimental trends observed in the combustion tests. The detailed reaction mechanism can describe the interaction of NO and ammonia in the reburning and <b>overfire</b> air zones, the effect of mixing times, and the sodium promotion effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of soot was investigated within the fuel-lean (<b>overfire)</b> region of overventilated buoyant turbulent diffusion flames burning in still air. The study {{was limited to}} the long residence time regime where characteristic flame residence times are roughly more than an order of magnitude longer than the laminar smoke point residence time and soot generation factors (the mass of soot emitted per unit mass of fuel carbon burned) are relatively independent of flame residence times. Both gaseous and liquid fuels were used to provide a range of H/C ratios (1 - 2. 7) and fuel types (alkynes, alkenes, alkanes, aromatics, and alcohols) as follows: toluene, acetylene, benzene, propylene, ethylene, n-heptane, propane, and isopropanol. Measurements included transmission electron microscopy to find primary particle diameters, the number of primary particles per aggregate and aggregate geometrical and fractal dimensions. The results show that the {{structure of}} soot varies with fuel type but is relatively independent of both position in the <b>overfire</b> region and flame residence time for the long residence time regime. Mean primary particle diameters were 30 - 51 nm and the mean number of primary particles per aggregate were 255 - 552, with the larger values associated with the more heavily sooting fuels. Aggregate fractal dimensions, however, were less dependent on fuel type, only varying in the range 1. 70 - 1. 79. The structure measurements are used to estimate the optical properties of <b>overfire</b> soot, based on a recent approximate theory for polydisperse aggregates, finding significant differences between aggregate and Rayleigh scattering properties in the visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum, even though the primary particles are well within the Rayleigh scattering regime...|$|R

The first is for a 265 MWg B&W opposed-wall pulverized coal furnace, the second for a 530 MWg B&W opposed wall cyclone-fired boiler, and the third for a 500 MWg B&W supercritical pulverized coal furnace fired with burners on all four walls. Furnace simulations identified locations of highest flue gas mass flows and highest CO and O 2 concentrations and were used by the combustion engineers to identify OFA port placement for maximum NOx reduction with lowest increases in unburned carbon in fly ash and CO emission. For the first two units, simulations with OFA additions predicted 34 % and 80 % reductions in NOx emissions, respectively, with minimal changes in CO concentration and unburned carbon. Plant CEM data for these units confirmed the accuracy of the modeling results for pre-retrofit and post-retrofit operation. For the third unit, potential <b>overfire</b> air configurations resulting in NOx reductions ranging from 24 % to 43 % are presented and impacts on CO emissions and carbon-in-fly ash are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive numerical method to analyse thermal radiation and chemical reactions in combustion processes for biofuels in a fixed bed. The <b>overfire</b> air {{region and the}} bed are modelled simultaneously. A finite volume method is applied. It is found that SIMPLEC is preferable compared to SIMPLE in handling the pressure-velocity linkage in this case. The {{results show that the}} model provides reasonable distributions of the temperature distribution but some parameters, alpha (a weighting factor), d(p) the particle diameter, and the porosity distribution should be chosen carefully.

40|$|Recent {{regulations}} have required reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from electric utility boilers. To comply with these regulatory requirements, {{it is increasingly}} important to implement state-of-the-art NOx control technologies on coal-fired utility boilers. This paper reviews NOx control options for these boilers. It discusses the established commercial primary and secondary control technologies and examines {{what is being done}} to use them more effectively. Furthermore, the paper discusses recent developments in NOx controls. The popular primary control technologies in use in the United States are low-NOx burners and <b>overfire</b> air. Data reflect that average NOx reductions for specific primary controls have ranged from 35 % to 63 % from 1995 emissions levels. The secondar...|$|R
40|$|The Sm 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 CoO 3 -delta (SSC) cathode was {{fabricated}} under slightly <b>overfired</b> {{condition and}} was in situ treated with 25 % CO 2 (V/V) under single cell operating circumstance. XRD and TG analysis demonstrated that some SrCO 3 and Co 3 O 4, appeared on the SSC surface after CO 2 treatment at 600 V. The existence of SrCoO 3 -delta and Co 3 O 4 under air sweep condition resulted in the changes of physicochemical properties of cathode surface to some extent. The acceleration of oxygen reduction rate of the cathode electrocatalyst evidently decreased the polarization resistance and consequently yielded about 20 % higher cell performance than the untreated one...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Innovative Clean Coal Technology (ICCT) project demonstrating advanced wall-fired combustion techniques for the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from coal-fired boilers. The project was conducted at Georgia Power Company`s Plant Hammond Unit 4 located near Rome, Georgia. The technologies demonstrated at this site include Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation`s advanced <b>overfire</b> air system and Controlled Flow/Split Flame low NOx burner. The primary objective of the demonstration at Hammond Unit 4 was to determine the long-term effects of commercially available wall-fired low NOx combustion technologies on NOx emissions and boiler performance. Short-term tests of each technology were also performed to provide engineering information about emissions and performance trends. A target of achieving fifty percent NOx reduction using combustion modifications was established for the project. Short-term and long-term baseline testing was conducted in an {open_quotes}as-found{close_quotes} condition from November 1989 through March 1990. Following retrofit of the AOFA system during a four-week outage in spring 1990, the AOFA configuration was tested from August 1990 through March 1991. The FWEC CF/SF low NOx burners were then installed during a seven-week outage starting on March 8, 1991 and continuing to May 5, 1991. Following optimization of the LNBs and ancillary combustion equipment by FWEC personnel, LNB testing commenced during July 1991 and continued until January 1992. Testing in the LNB+AOFA configuration was completed during August 1993. This report provides documentation on the design criteria used in the performance of this project as it pertains to the scope involved with the low NOx burners and advanced <b>overfire</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The thermal hazard {{posed by}} large {{hydrocarbon}} fires {{is dominated by}} the radiative emission from high temperature soot. Since the optical properties of soot, especially in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as its morphological properties, are not well known, efforts are underway to characterize these properties. Measurements of these soot properties in large fires are important for heat transfer calculations, for interpretation of laser-based diagnostics, and for developing soot property models for fire field models. This research uses extractive measurement diagnostics to characterize soot optical properties, morphology, and composition in 2 m pool fires. For measurement of the extinction coefficient, soot extracted from the flame zone is transported to a transmission cell where measurements are made using both visible and infrared lasers. Soot morphological properties are obtained by analysis via transmission electron microscopy of soot samples obtained thermophoretically within the flame zone, in the <b>overfire</b> region, and in the transmission cell. Soot composition, including carbon-to-hydrogen ratio and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentration, is obtained by analysis of soot collected on filters. Average dimensionless extinction coefficients of 8. 4 {+-} 1. 2 at 635 nm and 8. 7 {+-} 1. 1 at 1310 nm agree well with recent measurements in the <b>overfire</b> region of JP- 8 and other fuels in lab-scale burners and fires. Average soot primary particle diameters, radius of gyration, and fractal dimensions agree with these recent studies. Rayleigh-Debye-Gans theory of scattering applied to the measured fractal parameters shows qualitative agreement with the trends in measured dimensionless extinction coefficients. Results of the density and chemistry are detailed in the report...|$|R

The eleventh reporting period in Phase II (April 1 -June 30, 2000) included design validation AR-Lean tests (Task 2. 6) in the 10 x 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr Tower Furnace. The objective of tests was to determine the efficiency of AR-Lean at higher than optimum OFA/N-Agent injection temperatures in large pilot-scale combustion facility. Tests demonstrated that co-injection of urea with <b>overfire</b> air resulted in NO{sub x} reduction. However, observed NO{sub x} reduction was smaller than that under optimum conditions...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{results of}} mass of soot emitted per mass of fuel burned are {{presented}} {{for a range}} of flow conditions and fuels. Using digital imaging, flame lengths have also been measured and used to estimate flame residence times. Comparisons are made between the current measurements and results of earlier researchers for soot in the <b>overfire</b> region.
