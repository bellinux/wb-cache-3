5|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{especially}} in the week immediately following the invasion, popular <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, despite British aid, little air <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> encountered. As the Allies withdrew and {{resistance}} collapsed, the Allies began evacuating to Crete. The Stukas inflicted severe damage on Allied shipping. On 22 April, the 1,389ton destroyers Psara and Ydra were sunk. In {{the next two}} days, the Greek naval base at Piraeus lost 23 vessels to Stuka attack.|$|E
25|$|Inadmissible oppositions and <b>oppositions</b> which <b>are</b> deemed not to {{have been}} filed are not substantively {{examined}} (no examination on the merits). An <b>opposition</b> can only <b>be</b> rejected as inadmissible if the <b>opposition</b> has <b>been</b> first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have <b>been</b> filed, the <b>opposition</b> exists, even if later the <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> rejected as inadmissible. If an <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> deemed {{not to have}} been filed, an already paid <b>opposition</b> fee <b>is</b> refunded. In contrast, if an <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> rejected as inadmissible, an already paid <b>opposition</b> fee <b>is</b> not refunded.|$|R

5|$|In January 2004, with Garry Kasparov, Boris Nemtsov, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza and others, Bukovsky was {{a co-founder}} of Committee 2008.

5|$|The 39th Parliament was {{controlled}} by a Conservative Party minority, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the 28th Canadian Ministry, which assumed power on February 6, 2006. The Official <b>Opposition</b> <b>was</b> the Liberal Party, led first by interim leader Bill Graham, and then by Stéphane Dion {{for the remainder of}} the Parliament's life.|$|E
5|$|The main Axis <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> Kampfgruppe von Herff, {{positioned}} {{on the desert}} plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the Trento Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of Bersaglieri—well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support.|$|E
50|$|Saturn {{makes an}} {{opposition}} (180°) to the Moon, {{and so the}} <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> said {{to be of the}} nature of Saturn. Saturn is the greater of the two malefics, and so the <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> the most negative and harmful of the two negative aspects.|$|R

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong <b>opposition,</b> <b>was</b> enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the success}} of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two {{supporting}} operations codenamed Aberlour and Ottawa. In the former the 3rd Infantry Division, supported by a Canadian infantry brigade, would attack north of Caen; the latter would be a move by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade to take the village and airfield of Carpiquet. Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in manpower and materiel. The initial <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> expected to come from the depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E

5|$|Dormand opposed Britain's {{membership}} of the European Economic Community (EEC), {{and at the time}} of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.|$|E
5|$|During the {{elections}} of 1866, Heliade Rădulescu won {{a seat in the}} Chamber as a deputy for the city of Târgovişte. As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join Nicolae Ionescu and other disciples of Simion Bărnuţiu in opposing the appointment of Carol of Hohenzollern as Domnitor and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the RAAF {{were also}} {{available}} {{to support the}} landing. The plan for the operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, reinforced with Beauforts from No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons, would attack the landing area before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships. Prior to the landing, the air strike was cancelled by the RAAF officer who {{was attached to the}} landing force to coordinate air support as no <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> expected.|$|E

50|$|A binary {{opposition}} (also binary system) {{is a pair}} {{of related}} terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> the system by which, in language and thought, two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another. It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right. Binary <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought. In structuralism, a binary <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.|$|R
5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's {{position as a}} political and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> taken over by his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part {{as a sign of}} respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|France closely {{followed}} the election, deporting a Peace Corps teacher. The UDSG {{disappeared from the}} political scene, and M'ba's <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> composed of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. Nevertheless, the opposition garnered 46% of the vote and 16 of 47 seats in the assembly, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats. The opposition disputed this, and held strikes across the country, though these {{did not have a}} sizable impact on business.|$|E
5|$|In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp was in {{the middle}} of a bitter {{political}} battle known as the Old Court-New Court controversy. He identified with the New Court, or Relief party, which promoted a legislative agenda favorable to debtors. In <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> the Old Court, or Anti-Relief party, which worked to secure the rights of creditors to collect debts. Sharp had served as the state's attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party's power was beginning to wane.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina, biographer Robert D. Crassweller {{claims that the}} English-speaking nations of North America and Europe largely {{misunderstood}} Argentina's response {{to the death of}} Perón as well as the ornate funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Peróns and Argentina, saying that the Peróns were of the Hispanic tradition and that their <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> largely of British ancestry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew died on 21 September 1235. Béla, {{who succeeded}} his father without <b>opposition,</b> <b>was</b> crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 14 October.

The former was accused of having, in King Andrew's life, an adulterous liaison with Queen Beatrix, the King's young widow. Béla ordered her imprisonment, but she managed to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, where {{she gave birth to}} a posthumous son, Stephen. Béla and his brother Coloman considered her son a bastard.|$|E
