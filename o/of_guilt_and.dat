5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v.

In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

Eventually horrific footage from the concentration camps would serve to harden public opinion and bring it more in line with that of policymakers.|$|R
5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

Chris collapses due to complications from his surgery and is readmitted to hospital. He apologises to Will for cancelling on him and then tells him about Hudson. During Chris's next visit to Hudson, he appears distracted and when Hudson asks him if he is seeing someone else, Chris hesitates and Hudson breaks up with him. Chris tells Hudson about Will and how lonely he is. Hudson does not want Chris to date him out <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> they say goodbye. Chris spends some time with Will and they begin dating, but the relationship ends when Will's dog, Napoleon, bites Kyle's dog Bossy, and Will refuses to accept responsibility or apologise.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} examines the grace-orientation and problem-solving styles {{of gay and}} lesbian people of faith relative to their relationship with God and the extent, if any, of their internalized homonegativity. This issue was investigated using psychological measures involving a) the style of religious problem-solving, b) internalized homonegativity, c) feelings <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> d) personal experiences of grace. Statistical analyses found that having less homonegativity toward oneself and the disclosure of homosexuality is associated with higher levels of experienced grace and lower feelings <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt.</b> Collaborative <b>and</b> deferring religious problem-solving styles correlated positively with both experienced grace and awareness of grace. Additionally, personal feelings <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> are significantly positively correlated with the awareness of grace. The lower feelings <b>of</b> shame, <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> internalized homonegativity suggest that an adaptive integration of sexuality and spirituality is positively correlated with experiences of grace...|$|R

40|$|How do {{experiences}} <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> {{shape or}} reflect {{the ways in}} which the vanquished are reconciled (or not) to the new world order established by the victors? Shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> are universal experiences in the emotional landscape of post-war politics, albeit for different reasons and with radically different political effects. An examination of Germany after 1918 and of Japan after 1945 reveals that experiences <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may be pivotal for creating conditions of possibility for reconciliation marked by political and moral transformation. This transformative potential <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> however, is a double-edged sword. In threatening old identities, values and beliefs, experiences <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may provoke defensive, reactionary and violent political responses, and thus may precipitate hideous rather than salutary transformations. Political leadership and political culture are crucial factors in shaping the kind of reconciliation — reactionary or transformative — as well as the specific nature of transformations that experiences <b>of</b> shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may motivate the vanquished to pursue...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} tested the proposition {{of a positive}} relationship between the experience <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt</b> by Dutch natives for the wrongdoing to Jews {{at the time of the}} Second World War and having a positive attitude with regard to Israel in the conflict with Palestine, whereby the intention to repair declares this relationship.

The hypotheses have been explored using a questionary (N = 103), with questions regarding the experience <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt,</b> the positive attitude with regard to Israel, the intention to repair, identification, generation and demographics. Results indicate that there is a relationship between the experience <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> the intention to repair. However, there seems to be no relationship between the experience <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> having a positive attitude with regard to Israel, whereby the intention to repair declares this relationship.

40|$|This essay {{concerns}} the problems <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> that emerge {{in connection with}} genocide discussed after the Second World War by Hannah Arendt, Karl Jaspers, Jean Améry and Primo Levi. It looks at the different forms of guilt: of perpetrators, bystanders, victims who became perpetrators, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt.</b> It argues that a way to understand the structure <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> is to consider the idea <b>of</b> survivor <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> its link to an underlying metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> It considers primarily Levi’s account <b>of</b> survivor <b>and</b> accomplice <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> the ‘grey zone’ where judgements become problematic. The aim is to consider the ethical structure that supports our understanding <b>of</b> specific <b>guilt</b> categories, <b>and</b> this is linked to Roy Bhaskar’s account of MetaReality {{and the sense of}} a unity or identity that operates at a deeper level than the difference, conflict and change that the other levels of his thought seek to understand. ...|$|R

25|$|Germany in Autumn (Deutschland im Herbst) is an omnibus film, a {{collective}} work of eight German filmmakers including Fassbinder, Alf Brustellin, Volker Schlöndorff, Bernhard Sinkel and Alexander Kluge, the main organizer behind the project. They {{took a look}} at the wave <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> paranoia that afflicted West Germany's society and its authorities in the months between the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer by Red Army Faction members and the deaths of Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe in Stammheim Prison. The film is a document about terrorism and its sociopolitical aftermath. It begins with Schleyer's wake, a segment filmed by Alexander Kluge and Volker Schlöndorff, and it ends with the tumultuous joint funeral of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe in Stuttgart.|$|E
