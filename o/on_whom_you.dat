500|$|Filmmakers, {{crew members}} and co-stars {{tend to agree}} that Pfeiffer is {{extremely}} [...] "committed" [...] to her work, developing a [...] "reputation for competence, control, and hyper-preparation". At times Pfeiffer {{has been described as}} difficult to work with, particularly by Robert Towne, who directed her in Tequila Sunrise; Towne famously dubbed Pfeiffer [...] "the most difficult actress in Hollywood". On this designation, Pfeiffer admitted that she can seem difficult at times but it mostly [...] "depends <b>on</b> <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> talk to." [...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that {{there was a time when}} attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and I never will – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to scrunch her face and narrow her eyes before responding to questions. Pfeiffer always discards old scripts in which she has written extensive notes about her characters, nor does she retain film reviews, magazine clippings or covers about her work or performances.|$|E

Club months after giving the film a [...] "C-" [...] grade, Nathan Rabin concluded, [...] "Depending <b>on</b> <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> ask, Snyder {{set out to make}} either the ultimate sexist masturbatory fanboy fantasy or the ultimate critique of sexist masturbatory fanboy fantasies. He failed spectacularly on both counts, but in true Fiasco form, there's something fascinating and even strangely majestic about that failure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steele's book, , was {{released}} on January 4, 2010; it was published by Regnery Publishing, [...] The Associated Press reported that, [...] "Steele focuses much of the book on familiar GOP denunciations of President Barack Obama's overall policies (a roadmap to failure), the $787 billion stimulus bill (a reckless, wasteful, pork-laden spending spree), liberal views on manmade global warming (A threat to life on Earth? Depends <b>on</b> <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> ask) and other issues. To regain the public confidence, Steele says the GOP should, among other things, expose the reign of error inherent in liberal policies, contrast conservative and liberal principles, and highlight {{the damage caused by}} Obama's policies while explaining conservative solutions." ...|$|E

2500|$|CNNMéxico {{stated that}} Grillo {{has been in}} [...] "more crime scenes than he can remember", and that his book {{includes}} [...] "interviews with hitmen, members of the cartels, politicians and police officers, and people trapped in the crossfire". [...] According to the Spanish-speaking newspaper, Grillo repeatedly comes back to an idea: [...] "Wars start because people cannot feed their families. They start because people feel inferior, without rights, angry and frustrated. They want something bigger in their lives. And you only need a group people with moral depression {{to convince them that}} killing and dying spectacularly means glory. Islamic terrorist, kamikaze squads, street gangs, the cartels. They were all children at one time." [...] Goodreads said that Grillo did an [...] "incredible job" [...] for his book, where he [...] "synthesized traditional interviews, academic research, pop culture and WikiLeaks to create a powerful and alarming picture of the cartels of Mexico". He was also complimented for explaining the [...] "root causes" [...] that threaten Mexican society and [...] "probably have potential to be a disruptive force across the American continent and perhaps globally". Borderland Beat noted that Grillo seems to be [...] "tune with the realities on the ground in Mexico". In addition, it mentioned that the author takes the reader into the world of the [...] "narcocorridos", the drug ballads celebrating the exploits of the drug traffickers; Grillo also explores the [...] "Santa Muerte, the peculiarly Mexican church (or cult, depending <b>on</b> <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> ask), favored by the poor, the delinquent, and the dopers". The writer of the article in Borderland Beat mentioned that although Grillo believes that the Mexican drug cartels are closer to a [...] "criminal insurgency", he cannot buy the appellegation because the cartels do not have an ideology behind what they do, since their goal is making money.|$|E

60|$|The {{morning after}} Lord Lambeth had had {{with his own}} frankest critic that {{exchange}} of ideas which has just been narrated, the ladies at Jones’s Hotel received from him a written invitation to pay their projected visit to Branches Castle on the following Tuesday. “I think I’ve made up a very pleasant party,” his lordship went <b>on.</b> “Several people <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> know, {{and my mother and}} sisters, who have been accidentally prevented from making your acquaintance sooner.” Bessie at this lost no time in calling her sister’s attention to the injustice she had done the Duchess of Bayswater, whose hostility was now proved to be a vain illusion.|$|R

At the National Land Survey (NLS), the term “The integrated cadastral system of Sweden ” is used. This {{means that the}} whole infrastructure, the registered and presented property information (land, owners, users, houses etc.), is integrated with its geographic location. These data cover the whole nation, {{but they are not}} stored in a single database. Several authorities (i. e. Municipalities, Taxation authorities, and NLS) maintain the database infrastructure. The cadastral data are linked with unique identities in order to work in a uniform system for presentation and analyses. The word Cadastral refers to land ownership information. This information has references to location of the parcels. In Sweden, the word has a more general meaning. It includes a lot of other information connected to the land parcel, like ownership and rights to land, taxation information, buildings and real property information, mortgages, plans, regulations etc...|$|R
