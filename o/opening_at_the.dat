5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The door <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Species {{received}} a wide theatrical release on July 7, 1995. Its opening weekend was $17.1million, MGM's biggest <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time and {{second in the}} box office ranking behind Apollo 13. Budgeted at $35 million, the film earned a total of $113million worldwide ($million adjusted for inflation), including $60 million in the United States. The film was released on DVD on March 26, 1997, and on VHS on August 3, 1999. The original DVD featured a booklet with trivia, production notes and a making-of featurette. On July 25, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{features}} of the bridge include semi-elliptical portal arches and ribbon <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eaves. The structure was named for George X. Wendling, who established a post office nearby in the 1890s.|$|R

5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|The Shirelles' {{story was}} shown in Baby It's You!, a musical revue written by Floyd Mutrux and Colin Escott, which follows the story of Greenberg and Scepter Records. The revue played on Broadway for 148 performances, <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Broadhurst Theatre on April 27, 2011 and closing on September 4 of the same year.The use of their likenesses without {{permission}} led to Lee, {{as well as the}} estates of Coley and Harris, to sue Warner Bros.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at {{the back end of}} the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E

50|$|A further category, which touches upon secure communication, is {{software}} {{intended to}} take advantage of security <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end-points. This software category includes trojan horses, keyloggers and other spyware.|$|R
25|$|The facade {{displays}} Neoclassical elements: symmetry, smooth wall, ornamented {{windows for}} each floor, small <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} elevation, topped with a corbel table, and a small stone balcony.|$|R
5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is the <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{top of a}} cargo hold. The mechanical devices {{which allow}} hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% {{of the length of}} the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated {{around the edges of the}} hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Kate and Sawyer stay at {{the second}} {{triangulation}} point, while Sayid goes to the third. After learning of Jack's situation from Sawyer, Kate goes to help, leaving the job of turning on the signal to Sawyer. Charlie squeezes through an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cave and finds Jack, but while doing so, the opening collapses and traps Charlie and Jack inside. Charlie hesitantly pops Jack's shoulder back into place at Jack's request. Jack correctly guesses that Charlie is suffering from withdrawal, and Charlie assures Jack he's okay. Kate desperately tries to dig them out {{along with the other}} castaways, while the two worry about losing oxygen. Charlie sees a moth which leads him to an opening and the pair dig out of the cave.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{also worked}} with Irving and Stevenson's publisher, Longmans, to block Bandmann's {{production}} {{and those of other}} competitors. In the UK, unlike the U.S., the novella had copyright protection. Longmans brought legal actions against the unauthorized versions; its efforts blocked a William Howell Poole production from <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Theatre Royal in Croydon on July 26. That day, Fred Wright's Company B presented one performance of its adaptation at the Park Theatre in Merthyr Tydfil before it was also closed. Bandmann had the Opera Comique theater reserved from August 6, but hoped to open his production earlier. Irving blocked this by reserving the theater for Mansfield's rehearsals, and Mansfield's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde opened at the Lyceum on August 4. Bandmann went ahead with his August 6 opening, but after two performances the production was shut down because of legal action by Longmans.|$|E
50|$|Males {{and females}} are {{distinguished}} by <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} trunk: females have a tiny, raised round pore for extruding eggs and males have a fore-and-aft slit for accepting them.|$|R
25|$|Henry also {{undertook}} {{a few other}} minor changes, such as raising the transept {{on the east side}} and adding <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> column level. These column-level portals were among the first ever such constructed.|$|R
50|$|The {{structures}} called respiros (breaths) or ventosa (cup) {{with small}} <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top have unclear function. All {{three of them}} a situated {{on top of a}} spring, from which lead an underground gallery (mina).|$|R
5|$|Mantou kiln: The mantou kiln was {{the most}} common type of pottery kiln in north China, in {{historical}} periods when the dragon kiln dominated south China; both seem to have emerged in the Warring States period of approximately 475 to 221 BC. It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370Â°C. There is a door or bricked-up <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2013, the London {{premiere of}} the play was {{announced}} as an Off West End <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bush Theatre, beginning in May 2013 {{under the direction of}} Nadia Fall. Its previews were scheduled to begin on May 17 before opening on May 22 and running until June 15. On March 15, Disgraced was extended until June 22. The play opened as scheduled on May 22. That July, the producer Matthew Rego announced that the show was being considered for a Broadway run during the 201314 season. On June 10, 2014, was announced to have a Broadway run starting on October 23, following previews beginning September 27 at the Lyceum Theatre.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott, in {{partnership}} with AMC Theatres, hosted the premiere of the first full Prometheus trailer at the AMC Downtown Disney during WonderCon in Anaheim, California. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut. Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive, and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release. On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Vue Cinema in Leicester Square, London. The screening, {{and in particular the}} 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.|$|E
50|$|Some {{changes were}} made to the {{original}} building. The entrance along Buena Vista near the southeast corner was added. <b>The</b> <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northwest corner were rebuilt and expanded, and the cast iron piers added.|$|R
30|$|The cheeks are {{expanded}} {{by the air}} that is pushed out progressively but slowly through the closed lips, except for small <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sides. This promotes periosteum stimulation, which in turn induces new alveolar bone formation [14, 37, 38].|$|R
50|$|Lanterns of the Dead (Lanternes des morts) {{are small}} stone towers found chiefly in the centre {{and west of}} France, pierced with small <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top, where a light was {{exhibited}} at night to indicate {{the position of a}} cemetery.|$|R
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum â Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty {{from the sides of}} the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|Paiyaa got a solo {{release on}} 2 April 2010, coinciding with Good Friday. It earned 71 lakh {{in the opening}} weekend across Chennai with an average {{occupancy}} of 90%. The film grossed 3 crore {{in the first three}} days and was declared a commercial success within a few days. In the United Kingdom the film was distributed by B4U and was released across six screens, grossing Â£21,021 in the opening weekend, <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 23rd place. Furthermore, in Malaysia, the film opened across 34 screens and collected $349,368 after the second week. In Tamil Nadu, it netted 13 crore from 300 screens in two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatoryâbuccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2 {{level are}} either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2, artificial) or preemptive, {{depending}} on the system. Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more).|$|R
50|$|The 1930 {{bridge was}} added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and removed after 1987. Features {{included}} Howe truss construction, ribbon <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eaves, rectangular arched portals, and an eye-level window on one side for spotting oncoming traffic.|$|R
50|$|In its <b>opening</b> weekend <b>at</b> <b>the</b> North American box office, {{the film}} grossed $16.2 million USD, <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> #2 behind Fool's Gold.|$|R
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (<b>opening)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> side of the skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
50|$|The south {{eastern side}} party wall is {{shared with the}} one {{storeyed}} building adjacent to Edwards Chambers. The north western concrete wall has several small infilled <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far end where toilets are located internally. Surface mounted water pipes run the over this wall.|$|R
50|$|The two side {{elevations}} incorporate four bays each, and {{are also}} defined by pilasterswith ionic capitals. Fenestration Includes pairs of square-shaped window openings within each bay <b>at</b> each of <b>the</b> upper five stories. <b>Openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground level of both elevatorsinclude storefront windows, small windows and doorways.|$|R
5000|$|Protective {{clothing}} : Aprons and smocks typically fasten <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear as {{they have}} no <b>openings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front which could admit staining or hazardous substances. Most household aprons {{are designed to be}} donned quickly and can simply be slipped over the head and tied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the waist.|$|R
