5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island.

By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E

5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|Due to the area's vacationers, many {{of which}} come from New York and Northern New Jersey, Route 37 is {{routinely}} congested with seasonal traffic in the summer, especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the Garden State Parkway interchange as heavy tourist traffic converges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area's rapid growth in commercial development.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land.

Men and children would traditionally leave their catch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E
