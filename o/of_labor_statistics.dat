5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics</b> (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{estimate}} inter-industry {{wage differentials}} using the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics’s</b> National Compensation Survey (NCS) dataset. The NCS dataset {{has a number}} of distinct advantages over household survey datasets typically used for this purpose, in part because its establishment data contain information on job content and more accurate measures of industry and occupation. The authors find that controlling for job functions substantially lowers inter-industry wage variation. To the extent that job function proxies for productivity, a substantial portion of inter-industry wage variation may be explained by worker sorting on (observed) ability...|$|R

5|$|Willamette’s {{library was}} {{designated}} as a Federal Depository Library in 1969. It serves as the library for the 5th Congressional District population. The library selects around 20% of the documents available with areas of concentration in earth sciences, education, history, politics, economics, health, accounting, business, government, public policy, human resources, and others. Additionally, the university selects major items from the Census Bureau, Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics,</b> {{the office of the}} President, and Congress. Other materials come from the Smithsonian Institution, the Small Business Administration, the Department of State, and the Department of Education to list a few.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics.</b> Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
5000|$|The Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics's</b> 1936 Handbook <b>of</b> American trade-unions {{noted that}} [...] "Negroes are ineligible for {{membership}} {{in most of the}} standard railroad unions and have therefore formed their own, somewhat sporadically {{and for the most part}} locally." [...] Redd decided to try to form a national movement, hoping for strength from numbers. In early 1934 Claude Barnett, head of the Associated Negro Press, was asked for help by the ACRT attorney. Barnett brought in Robert L. Mays to organize a publicity campaign for the planned Association of Railway Employees. Dozens of delegates from local organizations answered Redd's call and met in Chicago in September 1934 to found the association.|$|R

5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics,</b> although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics,</b> to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
