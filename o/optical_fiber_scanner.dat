30|$|The fiber {{scanning}} {{is often}} realized {{by using a}} piezoelectric actuator [7 – 9, 14, 16 – 19]. A single <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> is precisely mounted on a piezoelectric microactuator or inside a quadrupole piezoelectric tube. The <b>fiber</b> <b>scanner</b> typically operates at the resonant frequencies of an <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> along the orthogonal axis and thus the fiber length easily controls the scanning speed. This resonant operation effectively obtains high scanning amplitude below the maximum voltage limit for human body. The <b>fiber</b> <b>scanner</b> often takes spiral scanning because a single <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> exhibits the same stiffness for the orthogonal scanning axes, which results in the same resonant frequencies. Myaing et al. have reported the spiral scanning of a single-mode <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> at 2.8  kHz resonant frequencies for both the axes [7] (Fig.  3 d). Lissajous scanning <b>fiber</b> <b>scanners</b> have been recently developed by operating a piezoelectric tube at two different operating frequencies for both the directions after differentiating the bi-directional spring constants of an <b>optical</b> <b>fiber.</b> For instance, Park et al. have reported Lissajous <b>fiber</b> <b>scanner</b> by using an off-set fiber fragment with micromachined silicon structures to separate the two resonant frequencies [9]. The silicon structures (0.5  ×  0.5  ×  1  mm 3) were located at 3.5  mm and 13.5  mm of the 20  mm long fiber apart from the actuator. The scanner has resonant frequencies at 86 and 97  Hz for x and y-axes, respectively, and shows the scanning amplitude of 732 and 591.7  μm at 40 Vpp. A micromachined tethered silicon oscillator (MTSO) for endoscopic Lissajous <b>fiber</b> <b>scanners</b> has been further demonstrated for the stiffness modulation of a scanning <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> in a simple manner [14] (Fig.  3 e). Recently, the Lissajous fiber scanning has also been demonstrated by using an electrothermal MEMS <b>fiber</b> <b>scanner.</b> Double hot arm and cold arm structures with a linking bridge and a mounted <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> on a silicon fiber groove enable the separation of resonant frequencies of a single <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> for Lissajous scanning [15] (Fig.  3 f).|$|R
