However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.|$|E

5|$|Measure 1–30: the {{orchestra}} presents itself with {{what looks like}} a ritornello, but is in fact rather a concerto tutti. The movement has the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> aria, modelled after the concerto style Bach had developed in Köthen: in that style the material is presented in an instrumental tutti.|$|E
5|$|The {{music is}} concertante and virtuoso {{for both the}} trumpet and the soloist. The first aria and the {{concluding}} Alleluja are in the style <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> concerto. Dürr observes that the five movements are in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and fugue. The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the trumpet), and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.|$|E
5|$|According to Antonucci, he based the {{characters}} on real {{people in his}} life.

Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.|$|E

A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{unbeknownst to}} Kurosawa, Rashomon had been {{entered in the}} prestigious Venice Film Festival, due {{to the efforts of}} Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based {{representative}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Battista Barbirolli {{was born}} in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> father and a French mother. He was a British {{national}} from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1928), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo {{and his father had}} played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979, when Gaven {{was twenty}} years old, {{she served as}} the {{replacement}} actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production of Grease. This was her Broadway debut. In late 1980, she was cast in the lead role of Janet in the musical The Rocky Horror Show that ran for six nights at Warner Theatre. It {{tells the story of}} a couple, Brad and Janet, who find themselves lost one night and end up in the laboratory of an alien doctor. The cast, including Gaven, was praised by critics. In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of Oliver! at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of Zorba, Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being held responsible for the suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her. She then portrayed the character Luisa, the wife <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> film director, in a production of Nine at An Evening Dinner Theater in 1985.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 1915, {{between two}} and four hours after news of the Italian {{declaration}} of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, Zrínyi {{and the rest of}} the fleet departed to bombard the Italian and Montenegrin coast. Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro. The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro-Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia, who were members of the Entente, during the first half of 1915. The attack on Ancona was an immense success, and the ships were unopposed during the operation. The bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> steamer in the port of Ancona itself, and an Italian destroyer, , was severely damaged further south. On the shore, the infrastructure of the port of Ancona, as well as the surrounding towns, were severely damaged. The railroad yard in Ancona, as well as the port facilities in the town, were damaged or destroyed. The local shore batteries were also suppressed. During the bombardment, Zrínyi also helped to destroy a train, a railway station, and a bridge at Senigallia. Additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves, warehouses, oil tanks, radio stations, and the local barracks. Sixty-three Italians, both civilians and military personnel, were killed in the bombardment. By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E
