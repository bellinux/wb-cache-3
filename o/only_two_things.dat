[...] To teammates and friends, Russell was open and amicable, but was extremely distrusting and cold towards anyone else. Journalists were often treated to the [...] "Russell Glower", described as an [...] "icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence". Russell was also notorious for his refusal to give autographs or even acknowledge the Celtics fans, so far that he was called [...] "the most selfish, surly and uncooperative athlete" [...] by one pundit.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{has been}} much quoted. In 1929, {{the editor of a}} music journal wrote, [...] "The stories {{gathered}} around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely {{to be one of the}} topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice." [...] A book, Beecham Stories, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his bons mots and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, [...] "A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, [...] "There are <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: [...] "Nothing from Mozart?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Anyway You Want It - Lagoon {{is proud}} to present, in {{partnership}} with the creator and director of Cirque Innosta, Joseph Wartnerchaney, Any Way You Want It. In a time when denim was distressed, Aqua Net was king and rock was as big as the hair, a local skating rink is threatened by a corporate takeover. One intrepid team of ladies takes a stand and fights for their right to party by competing in a quirky 80's-themed talent show. This gutsy group of gals lets everyone know that there's <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> to be afraid of ... a pair of roller skates and girl power!

An Asian version of Adolf Hitler… I want that person to be me; I want {{to save the world}} from this Zionist disease." [...] In June 2016, Tila Tequila accused Sarah Silverman and the Jews of killing Jesus before saying the comedian was next on a “celebrity sacrifice” list.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{left school}} at age 15 and worked briefly as a silk screen printer. Spurred on by his father, his {{ambition}} {{was to become}} a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he went for trials at Brentford F.C., a Third Division club at the time. Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials. In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, [...] "Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> I can do actually: play football and sing." ...|$|E

Johnny also urges Ponyboy to [...] "stay gold". Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: [...] "When I {{stepped out into the}} bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home..." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Kerosene", one of Atomizers {{standout}} tracks, {{is viewed}} by both Azerrad and Allmusic's Andy Kellman as the band's peak performance. Azerrad remarks on its [...] "powerful rhythm ripped straight from Gang of Four and guitars that sound like shattering glass", while Kellman calls it [...] "undeniably Big Black's brightest/bleakest moment, an epically roaming track that features an instantly memorable guitar intro, completely incapable of being accurately described by vocal imitation or physical gesture [...] It's Big Black's 'Light My Fire,' literally." [...] Riley explained that the song was {{about the effects of}} boredom in rural America: [...] "There's <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> to do: Go blow up a whole load of stuff for fun, or have a lot of sex with the one girl in town who'll have sex with anyone.

2500|$|Range Rovers, {{according}} to AutoTrader, [...] "can be complicated, costly vehicles, and {{are loaded with}} very expensive parts." [...] Reliability issues are common complaints. J.D. Power rankings for the Land Rover are in the lowest category - known as [...] "The Rest" [...] - for quality overall, dependability, sales satisfaction, and customer service, with the cars only earning a [...] "Better than Most" [...] rank in the performance and design overall category. The Land Rover brand has [...] "a legacy of quality problems" [...] and ranks [...] "at {{the bottom of the}} J.D. Power reliability ratings for three-year-old vehicles". The JD Power 2014 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) study ranked Land Rover last in overall customer satisfaction. However, one Motor Trend review of a 2014 Range Rover after [...] turned up <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> that went wrong with the car.

50|$|Joey Hermosa (Erich Gonzales) and Marcus Hanson (Mario Maurer) <b>only</b> have <b>two</b> <b>things</b> in common. One: {{they live}} to make fairy-tale romances happen — Joey through her {{exquisite}} wedding cakes; Marcus through the numerous romantic comedies he stars in. Two: their own love stories {{do not have}} the fairy-tale happy endings — she was just recently dumped at the altar; he just discovered that his on-screen partner and real-life girlfriend {{had fallen in love with}} another man.|$|R

30|$|One {{should not}} be {{surprised}} by the fact that MSE 3 DDCT and output MSE for some other vector filters can be smaller than the corresponding MSElb. This does not mean that MSElb values derived according to [43] are incorrect. This <b>only</b> demonstrates <b>two</b> <b>things.</b> First, the use of inter-component correlation being taken into account by a filter allows considerable improvement of filtering efficiency. Second, it is worth trying to derive lower bound MSE for multichannel filtering in the future.|$|R

A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete.|$|R
