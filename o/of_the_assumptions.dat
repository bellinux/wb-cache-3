5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later {{the decision was made to}} remove it amid growing casualties.|$|E

25|$|Ludwik Fleck {{establishes}} scientific constructivism {{by introducing}} {{the notions of}} thought collective (Denkkollektiv), and thought style (Denkstil), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects {{can be described in}} terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself.

25|$|After Finch {{published}} {{his work in}} 1937, few additional studies were done on volcano hazards in the Lassen area. However, that changed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. As a result, the USGS began reevaluating the risks posed by other potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range, including those in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Since that time, USGS scientists have been working {{in cooperation with the}} National Park Service to better understand volcano hazards in the Lassen area. As part of this work, the history of Cinder Cone has been reexamined. Most of the features of Cinder Cone have changed little since Harkness first described them in the 1870s, but all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> on which Finch based his conclusions have now been shown to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Jacques Tits {{introduced}} {{the theory of}} buildings, which relate algebraic groups to abstract simplicial complexes. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> is a non-triviality condition: If the building is an n-dimensional abstract simplicial complex, and if , then every k-simplex of the building must be contained {{in at least three}} n-simplices. This is analogous to the condition in classical projective geometry that a line must contain at least three points. However, there are degenerate geometries which satisfy all the conditions to be a projective geometry except that the lines admit only two points. The analogous objects in the theory of buildings are called apartments. Apartments play such a constituent role in the theory of buildings that Tits conjectured the existence of a theory of projective geometry in which the degenerate geometries would have equal standing with the classical ones. This geometry would take place, he said, over a field of characteristic one. Using this analogy it was possible to describe some of the elementary properties of F1, but {{it was not possible to}} construct it.|$|E
25|$|Following {{early work}} by Louis Bachelier and later work by Robert C. Merton, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{made a major}} {{breakthrough}} by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. By employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a closed-form solution for a European option's theoretical price. At the same time, the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective risk management of option holdings. While the ideas behind the Black–Scholes model were ground-breaking and eventually led to Scholes and Merton receiving the Swedish Central Bank's associated Prize for Achievement in Economics (a.k.a., the Nobel Prize in Economics), {{the application of the}} model in actual options trading is clumsy because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> of continuous trading, constant volatility, and a constant interest rate. Nevertheless, the Black–Scholes model {{is still one of the}} most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range.|$|E

500|$|One {{can define}} other number systems using {{different}} rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs {{would need to}} be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of —rather than independent alternatives to— the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as [...] "0.999..." [...] is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> built into the system must break down.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in South Africa, Haggard {{developed}} an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus. However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> that underlay contemporary Victorian politics and philosophy, such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: [...] "the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European... can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes." [...] The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them {{the object of a}} civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British [...] "alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty".|$|E

But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying {{in the middle of the}} orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface ...|$|E
