40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a modelling concept and structuring principle for rule-based systems the semantics of which is not restricted to a sequential behavior, but can be applied to various types of parallelism and concurrency. The central syntactic notion is that of a transformation unit that encapsulates a set of rules, <b>imports</b> <b>other</b> transformation <b>units,</b> and regulates the use and interaction of both by means of a control condition. The semantics is given by interlinking the applications of rules with the semantics of the <b>imported</b> <b>units</b> using a given collection of semantic operations. As the main result, the interlinking semantics turns out to be the least fixed point of the interlinking operator. The interlinking semantics generalizes the earlier introduced interleaving semantics of rule-based transformation units, which is obtained by the sequential composition of binary relations as only semantic operation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{introduce}} {{the notion of a}} transformation unit together with its interleaving semantics and to study it as a means of constructing large graph transformation systems from small ones in a structured and systematic way. A transformation unit comprises a set of rules, descriptions of initial and terminal graphs, and a control condition. Moreover, it may <b>import</b> <b>other</b> transformation <b>units</b> for structuring purposes. Its semantics is a binary relation between initial and terminal graphs which is given by interleaving sequences. As a generalization of ordinary derivations, an interleaving sequence consists of direct derivation steps interleaved with calls of <b>imported</b> transformation <b>units.</b> It must obey the control condition and may be seen as a kind of structured derivation. The introduced framework is independent of a particular graph transformation approach and, therefore, it may enhance the usefulness of graph transformations in many contexts...|$|R
40|$|Transformation {{units and}} {{transformation}} modules {{are known as}} structuring concepts for graph transformation systems.

Moreover, the interleaving semantics is relaxed. The <b>imported</b> <b>units</b> may now operate on local components of actual configurations rather than on the global objects...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> {{values are}} {{constructed}} {{to investigate the}} extent and speed of exchange rate and production cost pass-through into the unit values of Irish imports (total and sectoral) from the UK using Menon's (1996) mark-up model. The approach used to measure exchange rate pass-through is based on cointegration and error-correction modelling and the period of analysis is from 1979 to 1995. Full pass-through from the bilateral Irish pound-Sterling exchange rate and from UK producer costs could not be rejected for total and sectoral <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values for the sample period 1979 q 1 - 1995 q 4. This implies no role for domestic competing prices in explaining the long-run relationship determining unit values of Irish imports from the UK. The results indicate that for aggregate and sectoral unit values of Irish imports from the UK pass-through is incomplete in the short-run. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{exchange rate}} pass-through into German <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values {{over the last}} 20 years. I find incomplete pass-through to be the predominant characteristic for German imports with an average rate of 42 % over three months. This result holds when considering monthly 8 -digit data, the most disaggregated German import data available. Furthermore, I distinguish 16 German trading partners and estimate substantial cross-country differences in the pass-through to <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values. <b>Imports</b> coming from European countries generally exhibit statistically zero pass-through. By contrast, non-European trading partners are characterized by statistically significant incomplete pass-through rates. I also study {{whether there are differences}} in the pass-through rates for appreciations and depreciations, as well as for small and large exchange rate shocks. Moreover, I test for a negative correlation between the goods' quality and its pass-through rate. [...] exchange rate,pass-through,import prices,Germany...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{quantify}} empirically {{the degree of}} price transmission from border to retail prices in Mozambique. Using a database from the Customs Authority, we link average <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values at the border with retail prices for the same product and provincial market. Thus, this study provides evidence at the micro or product specific level on the determinants of consumer price changes. The main finding of the paper is that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is high and symmetric (similar for appreciation and depreciation episodes). Other transmission elasticity estimates, {{such as the one}} associated to changes in cif unit values or trade taxes, tend to be small or not statistically significant. This suggests that distribution margins may be used to offset changes in <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values and trade taxes, while changes in the exchange rate tend to be fully transmitted...|$|R

In order to describe large classes of similar transformation units in a manageable and finite way, we extend transformation units with formal parameters.

40|$|AbstractGraph {{transformation}} {{units are}} an approach-independent concept for programming by applying rules and <b>imported</b> transformation <b>units</b> to graphs, starting in an initial and {{ending in a}} terminal graph. This transformation process has to obey a so-called control condition, i. e. the device to select how rules or <b>imported</b> transformation <b>units</b> are to be combined in the transformation process executed by the unit. While {{the other parts of}} a unit may simply be required to be computable, this is too restrictive for control conditions. In this paper, we show that the semantics of certain control conditions is in general undecidable already when a single <b>imported</b> transformation <b>unit</b> occurs in the condition, and discuss the consequences for programming with graph transformation units...|$|R

40|$|As {{a further}} {{contribution}} to the growing international literature on exchange rate pass-through (PT), this study assesses the extent of PT for Irish import prices over the period 1963 to 1995. It fills two important gaps in the literature, by making due allowance for the time series properties of the data and by concentrating {{on the case of}} a small open economy. In order to assess the extent of PT a mark-up model for aggregate <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values is employed. It is argued that the usual single equation mark-up estimation technique leads to seriously biased and inefficient estimates of the degree of PT, as it ignores the strong simultaneity of import prices and domestic competing prices. This study makes use of the Johansen technique to allow for such simultaneity and uncovers two long-run equilibrium relationships among the data, for <b>import</b> <b>unit</b> values and domestic competing prices, and confirms the existence of very close to full PT for both. Previous results in the literature demonstrating substantially less than full PT {{may be due to the}} failure to make proper allowance for the time series properties of the data or for the strong simultaneity which exists between import and domestic competing prices. ...|$|R
