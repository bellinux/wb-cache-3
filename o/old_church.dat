5|$|A {{new church}} was needed because the <b>old</b> <b>church</b> needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} seen by Llwyd, Jones and Glynne was {{demolished}} {{and the present}} structure was erected, designed by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor.

5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century.

5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the <b>old</b> <b>Church.</b> According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E
5|$|In 831, Mojmir I was baptized, and his Moravian state {{became a}} part of the Bavarian Passau diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as {{political}} independence from East Frankish influence, his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries. As a result, Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: <b>Old</b> <b>Church</b> Slavonic, which employed the Glagolitic alphabet created by them. They translated the Bible and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Byzantine Greek Macedonia is also {{significant}} {{as being the}} home of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Greek brothers from Thessaloniki (Salonika) who were sent on state-sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east-central Europe. This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs' own language, for which they invented an alphabet that became known as <b>Old</b> <b>Church</b> Slavonic. In the process, this cemented the Greek brothers' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization and Orthodox Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs.|$|E
