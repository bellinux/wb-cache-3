5|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Upanishad opens as a {{conversation}} between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya, where Brihaspati asks Yajnavalkya {{for information about the}} place where the seat of all beings, the Brahman, lives. Yajnavalkya states that true Brahman-seat of all beings, or Kurukshetra, is Avimuktam – a place that Shiva never left. This Avimuktam is a part of Varanasi (Banaras). All renouncers, after having wandered places, should stay at this Avimuktam. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> are departing, leading one to videhamukti (salvation after death). This place is holy, a place to revere and not leave.|$|E

5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dying</b> Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E

The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure.

In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E

When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army.

40|$|<b>The</b> double-layer {{combined}} <b>die</b> is {{used for}} its longer life in forging.

40|$|Wear of dies is {{a serious}} problem in the forging industry. The {{materials}} used for <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are generally expensive steel alloys and <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> require costly heat treatment and surface finishing operations. Degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> profile implies rejection of forged components and necessitates resinking or replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Measures which reduce wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> can therefore aid in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> production costs. <b>The</b> work reported here is <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>die</b> wear in forging production where the batch size is small and the machine employed is a light hammer. This is a problem characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium and small scale area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forging industry where <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>dies</b> is a significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total capital investment. For the same energy input and under unlubricated conditions, die wear {{has been found to be}} sensitive to forging temperature; in cold forging <b>the</b> yield strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> material is <b>the</b> prime factor governing <b>the</b> degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> profile, whilst in hot forging <b>the</b> wear resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> material is <b>the</b> main factor which determines <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>die</b> wear. At an intermediate temperature, such as that characteristic <b>of</b> warm forging, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> wear is found to be less than that in both cold and hot forging. This preliminary study therefore points to the fact that the forging temperature must be taken into account in <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>die</b> material. Further, <b>the</b> forging industry must take serious note <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warm forging process, as it not only provides good surface finish, as claimed by many authors, but also has an inherent tendency to minimize die wear...|$|R
