40|$|Genetic algorithms, founded {{upon the}} {{principle}} of evolution, are applicable to many optimization problems, especially popular for solving parameter optimization problems. Reservoir <b>operating</b> rule <b>curves</b> {{are the most common}} way for guiding and managing the reservoir operation. These rule curves traditionally are derived through intensive simulation techniques. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of two genetic algorithms (GAs), i. e., binary coded and real coded, to derive multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> rule <b>curves.</b> The curves are assumed to be piecewise linear functions where the coordinates of their inflection points are the unknowns and we want to optimize system performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods are tested on the operation of the Shih-Men reservoir in Taiwan. The current M- 5 <b>operating</b> <b>curves</b> of the Shih-Men reservoir are also evaluated. The results show that the GAs provide an adequate, effective and robust way for searching the rule curves.

40|$|ObjectivePrediction of {{surgical}} site infection and mortality after cardiac surgery might allow for interventions to reduce adverse outcomes. We sought to evaluate existing risk scores. MethodsWe included 809 consecutive patients undergoing {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery. Data were collected prospectively. Infections were defined as deep sternal wound infection or mediastinitis by using established criteria and evaluated 60 days after surgical intervention. All-cause mortality was assessed at 30 days and 6 months. We assessed {{the ability of the}} National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index, the EuroSCORE, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score to predict infection and mortality. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>curve.</b> ResultsThe rate {{of surgical}} site infection was 3. 6 % (29 / 809 patients). The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index showed moderate discrimination for infection (area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>curve</b> of 0. 64) and poor ability to stratify patients into infection risk groups. The EuroSCORE predicted infection and 30 -day and 6 -month mortality with good discrimination (area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>curve</b> of 0. 72, 0. 78, and 0. 77, respectively). Ranking patients by the EuroSCORE and dividing the cohort into 3 roughly equal risk groups yielded an ascending risk for infection of 0. 7 %, 3. 0 %, and 7. 2 %. The preoperative and intraoperative Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores showed good discrimination for surgical site infection (area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>curve</b> of 0. 72 and 0. 76, respectively) and excellent discrimination for early and late mortality (area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>curve</b> of > 0. 80). Risk grouping based on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score yielded an ascending risk for infection of 0. 7 %, 3. 6 %, and 6. 4 %. ConclusionsThe EuroSCORE and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score can be used for joint risk stratification for surgical site infection and mortality.

The production process is examined using the two types of charts under three specific control policies which are: Policy 1 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two successive observations plot within the control limits but beyond the warning limits. Policy 2 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two out of three observations plot within the control limits but beyond the warning limits. Policy 3 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if seven successive observations plot within the control limits on any one side of the mean. This is followed by an investigation of the <b>operating</b> <b>curves</b> for the above mentioned policies. Performance of the charts, using these policies, is compared using their <b>operating</b> <b>curves</b> as well as an economic analysis. The results of performance analysis indicate that the two-sided Shewhart chart employing Policy 2 performs the best in terms of <b>operating</b> <b>curves</b> and is also the most economic to adopt, for the particular set of control chart design parameters.

40|$|In-line {{inspection}} is designated {{to detect}} out-of-control (OOC) performance {{in order to}} increase quality output, and thus profit. Since inspection capacity is costly, it raises the question of how much capacity should be acquired to minimize OOC. Clearly, lower OOC requires higher capacity. This paper suggests a model that optimizes inspection capacity and OOC tradeoff. It is based on a typical process step monitored by an inspection facility. Processed items are sampled and inspected, considering inspection rate and response time, in order to minimize OOC rate at a given capacity. The inspection <b>operating</b> <b>curve</b> is established for demonstrating the tradeoff between OOC rate and inspection capacity. It exhibits that OOC decreases at a reduced rate with increasing capacity.
