40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the dispute {{settlement}} provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC or Convention), and the potential and actual role that they play in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> The study focuses {{not only on the}} traditional role of dispute settlement mechanisms in peacefully settling disputes, but also on their potential for contribution to good <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> in many ways. The jurisprudence generated so far under the dispute settlement provisions of the LOSC can be called neither a complete success nor a total failure. Part XV of the Convention, dealing with dispute settlement procedures, has made a promising start with the inaugural jurisprudence under the prompt release and provisional measures proceedings. However, besides the general beneficial influence of the jurisprudence on <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> a few detrimental developments have also been identified from the perspective of <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> The present thesis demonstrates that a lot of hope had been pinned on the dispute settlement provisions at the time when the LOSC was drafted. However, most of these hopes have not yet found expression, and if the limited use of dispute settlement procedures continues, it is unlikely that Part XV will fulfil those hopes in the future. Nevertheless, this thesis argues along more optimistic lines, and expresses a realistic hope that the actual role of dispute settlement in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> will improve in the future. The thesis concludes that {{the success or failure of}} the dispute settlement mechanisms mostly depends upon their actual use made by states. Further, the dispute settlement mechanisms once invoked must be able to settle disputes objectively on the basis of law, equity and justice and uphold the principles and provisions of the LOSC. It is hoped that states will have recourse to Part XV more often for the purpose of settling their disputes peacefully, and that the dispute settlement provisions will in turn fulfil their mandate. Only then will the world witness the dispute settlement mechanisms playing a real and beneficial role in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> concurrently with other <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> institutions and arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Oceans were a key {{theme of}} the Rio+ 20 Conference in 2012 and the {{importance}} of conservation and sustainable use of the oceans was reinforced by the UN member states. This paper examines Australia’s policy capacity to develop and implement oceans policies in the context of its history of responses to key commitments to international forums, such as United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Our analysis highlights that governments such as Australia are now consciously making policies in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> that they know they have the capacity to deliver. We conclude that Australian <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> has been constrained by this tendency towards focusing on relatively ‘safe’ areas of policy development, and that deeper more radical engagement is needed in order to build policy capacity so that Australia again becomes globally recognised as a leading nation in policy innovation in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Oceans were a key {{theme of}} the Rio+ 20 Conference in 2012 and the {{importance}} of the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans was reinforced by the UN member states in The Future We Want agreement. During Rio+ 20, the Australian delegation focussed on achievements in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> such as the development of a National System of Marine Protected Areas. Australia announced its ocean commitments that included the prioritisation of international and regional initiatives, as well as maintaining fish stocks, elimination of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; and the elimination of harmful fisheries subsides that contribute to over-fishing and overcapacity. However, Australia did not specify any new commitments to national oceans policies or holistic approaches to <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> This paper examines Australia’s role in contributing to a blue economy, our past commitments to integrated <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> and whether Australia has the policy capacity to deliver the commitments from Rio+ 20. Policy capacity relates to the ability to make decisions through processes or procedures, and the quality of decisions through the substance of policy (Peters 1996; Painter and Pierre 2005; Haward 2006; Haward and Vince 2008). It is argued that <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> is strengthened through integrated approaches, however, the current Australian government does not have the policy capacity to commit to or deliver them. Nevertheless, Australia’s current ocean policies do establish a strong commitment to regional initiatives that focus on developing marine spatial plans and the implications of fisheries as food security...|$|R
40|$|As {{evidenced}} by Goal No. 14 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, {{the importance of}} <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> {{as a matter of}} global policy can hardly be overstated. The unsustainable uses of their resources could lead to serious consequences, not only for coastal communities, but remote landlocked countries as well. This special section aims to take the international community's clarion call for effective norms, institutions, and multi-stakeholder cooperation back to the oceans through three topical case studies. Each in its own way illustrates humanity's high stakes in blue growth, offering recommendations on how states and governments must craft coherent, effective, and actionable policies to make sustainable <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> a reality. Claire van der Geest's article opens the special section with a focus on the Indian Ocean and the need to redesign its fisheries governance. Hongzhou Zhang and Fengshi Wu subsequently investigate two of the most significant structural shifts of China's marine fisheries sector in the past decades, namely, going outward and focusing on high market value species. James Malcolm concludes the special section by switching attention to small island developing states, arguing that sustainable <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> for them represents not ‘only’ an environmental or economic concern, but indeed a matter of national security...|$|R

40|$|Oceans are {{of vital}} {{importance}} to the international community, not only for their living and non-living resources and the shipping and other maritime uses they facilitate, {{but also for the}} key role they play in the global climate and weather system. The marine environment, its resources, and its biodiversity are increasing threatened by human activities, both maritime and terrestrial. Anthropogenic climate change, seabased and land-based pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of alien species, over-exploitation of non-renewable resources, and destructive fishing practices are among the most serious threats. While each of these threats requires dedicated, separate attention, there is increasingly wide support for more holistic and integrated governance approaches that take account of the spatial dimension and functioning of ecosystems. This paper refers to such approaches as “ecosystem-based management” (EBM). The following three types of regional <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> mechanisms are reviewed in this paper: (a) Regional Seas programmes, most of which are supported or coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); (b) Regional fishery bodies (RFBs), some of which have been established under the framework of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); and (c) Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) mechanisms, most of which are projects supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This review is intended to assist states that participate in existing regional <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> mechanisms, as well as those that are considering participating, by clarifying the key distinctions between their mandates, highlighting the successes and challenges of existing mechanisms, and outlining cooperation and coordination efforts. Options are identified for strengthening existing mechanisms and cooperation and coordination between them, {{as well as for the}} creation of new regional <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> mechanisms, with particular reference to EBM...|$|R

50|$|At a {{national}} level, <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> {{is seen as}} an integrated management process within one state. This means there is a focus on almost all ministries of a government that have a function or authority related to ocean sectors and they collaborate.

40|$|<b>Oceans</b> <b>Governance</b> in the Twenty-first Century {{analyses}} {{the development}} of national, regional and international initiatives and arrangements directed towards governance of the world's seas and oceans. The authors examine those factors that shape <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> {{as well as the}} supports and constraints affecting policy development and implementation. In addition, the book invaluably includes discussion of contemporary international and selected regional initiatives – including {{the development of}} a maritime policy by the EU. The processes and outcomes that have arisen in the development of oceans policy in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US are also summarised. This analysis centres on the key elements of institutional design, policy capacity, and the policy framework adopted as important supports to facilitate integrated oceans management. The book concludes that, despite increased attention to the oceans over the past two decades, major challenges remain, even where states have made concerted efforts to develop new approaches to ocean management. Marcus Haward and Joanna Vince’s thorough study will appeal to researchers and academics at under and postgraduate levels working in the field of environmental management, as well as oceans and coastal management and governance. It will also be highly useful to policy makers with responsibilities for oceans and coastal management...|$|R

Maritime security is a fundamental requirement, including the capability for maritime surveillance and enforcement of national laws in national maritime zones. Bateman explores the roles of maritime security forces, including their contribution to maintaining international order at sea and the relative advantages of coast guards and navies for undertaking the tasks involved. These tasks are no longer just the prerogative of navies and are increasingly being performed by coast guards.

This article argues that government officials (or civil servants/bureaucrats) were essential agents of change who formed networks that contributed to successful policy transfer in oceans management...|$|R
50|$|The {{two reports}} listed strikingly similar recommendations. As a result, Congress and the Administration began to {{recognize}} the importance of ocean policy reform. To further these recommendations, and to act as one unified force, the two commissions came together in 2004 to establish the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. Admiral Watkins co-chaired the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative with Leon Panetta, and was called on as an expert to advise and testify before Congress on <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> reform.

50|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>governance</b> is {{the conduct}} of the policy, actions and affairs {{regarding}} the world's oceans. Within governance, it incorporates the influence of non-state actors, i.e. stakeholders, NGOs and so forth, therefore the state is not the only acting power in policy making. However, in terms of the ocean, this is a complex issue because it is a commons that is not ‘owned’ by any single nation/state. The consequences of this has resulted in humankind abusing the oceans’ resources, by treating them as shared resources, but not taking equal and collective responsibilities in caring for them. This means that rules on {{the conduct of}} the ocean can only be implemented through international agreements. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} some form of governance to maintain the ocean for its various uses, preferably in a sustainable manner.|$|E
