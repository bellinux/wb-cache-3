50|$|Traditional {{participant}} observation is usually undertaken {{over an extended}} period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations.

5000|$|Participant {{observation}} {{is one of}} the principle research methods of cultural anthropology. It relies {{on the assumption that the}} best way to understand a group of people is to interact with them closely over a long period of time. The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronislaw Malinowski in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of Sociology. Historically, the group of people being studied was a small, non-Western society. However, today it may be a specific corporation, a church group, a sports team, or a small town. There are no restrictions as to what the subject of participant observation can be, as long as the group of people is studied intimately by the observing anthropologist over a long period of time. This allows the anthropologist to develop trusting relationships with the subjects of study and receive an inside perspective on the culture, which helps him or her to give a richer description when writing about the culture later. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like taboo behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time, and researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the formal system) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a <b>one-time</b> <b>survey</b> of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.|$|E

40|$|Avian {{census data}} from {{tropical}} Pacific islands often {{are limited to}} brief, <b>one-time</b> <b>surveys.</b> These efforts yield information about species' presence and distribution but reveal little about variation in abundance through time. This variation may be important for refining and optimizing survey methods and, in turn, assessing habitat preferences, population status, activity patterns, or the impact of disturbance on the abundance and distribution of island birds. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if intra- or interannual patterns exist in the recorded abundance of resident land birds. Forest birds on Tutuila Island, American Samoa, were surveyed each month from 1992 to 1996 at 35 stations on six transects distributed around the island. We used multiple regression techniques to determine that seasonal patterns in detected abundance exist in several species, most notably the Purple-capped Fruit-dove, Ptilinopus porphyraceus, and the Wattled Honeyeater, Foulehaio carunculata. Intraannual patterns may be associated with seasonally variable vocalizations or with concentrations of birds at particular resources. Interannual trends in abundance were not islandwide for any native species during the study period; they were localized and as such may be attributable to small-scale changes in habitat rather than to overall changes in population size. The results of this study, especially that the abundance of nonmigratory island birds is seasonally variable, reinforce the importance of year-round monitoring in the study and conservation of Pacific birds...|$|R

40|$|The north-south heat {{transport}} {{is the prime}} manifestation of the ocean’s role in global climate, but understanding of its variability has been fragmentary owing to uncertainties in observational analyses, limitations in models, {{and the lack of}} a convincing mechanism. We review the dynamics of global ocean {{heat transport}} variability, with an emphasis on timescales from monthly to interannual. We synthesize relatively simple dynamical ideas and show that together they explain heat transport variability in a state-of-the-art, high-resolution ocean general circulation model. Globally, the cross-equatorial, seasonal heat transport fluctuations are close to plus or minus 3 x 10 supersccript 15 watts, the same amplitude as the seasonal, crossequatorial atmospheric energy transport. The variability is concentrated within 20 degrees of the equator and dominated by the annual cycle. The majority of the variability is due to wind-induced current fluctuations in which the time-varying wind drives Ekman layer mass transports that are compensated by depth-independent return flows. The temperature difference between the mass transports gives rise to the time-dependent heat transport. It is found that in the heat budget the divergence of the time-varying heat transport is largely balanced by changes in heat storage. Despite the Ekman transport’s strong impact on the time-dependent heat transport, the largely depth-independent character of its associated meridional overturning streamfunction means that it does not affect estimates of the timemean heat transport made by <b>one-time</b> hydrographic <b>surveys.</b> Away from the tropics, the heat transport variability associated with the depth-independent gyre and depth-dependent circulations, is much weaker than the Ekman variability. The non-Ekman contributions can amount to a 0. 2 – 0. 4 x 10 superscript 15 watts standard deviation in the heat transport estimated from a <b>one-time</b> hydrographic <b>survey...</b>|$|R

The Safe Schools Act prohibited weapons possession and required expulsion; defined weapons, school property, and school entity; established the Office of Safe Schools within the Department of Education; set forth reporting requirements for violence and weapons possession; required a sworn statement prior to admission to any school entity; provided for the transfer, maintenance, and availability of records; and required a <b>one-time</b> cost <b>survey</b> to the legislature.
