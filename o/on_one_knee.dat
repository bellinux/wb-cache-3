Ian {{did not have a}} ring with him because he originally planned on proposing to Christy at Lagoon on their way home from the Fiesta Bowl, but he could not give up the opportunity to propose on national TV after scoring the game-winning two-point conversion.

25|$|Younis is {{regarded}} as one of the best players of spin bowling in the world, being particularly strong on the leg side. His favourite and trademark shot is the flick, but it has also been his shortcoming, with him being particularly prone to falling lbw during the early stages of his innings. He is also prone to getting down <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> and driving extravagantly. But this flamboyance is coupled with grit. One of his main weaknesses is playing away from the body, he also has a tendency to leave straight balls, a trait that has been exploited by bowlers in the past, particularly by the Australian attack. Along with Mohammad Yousuf and the now retired Inzamam-ul-Haq, he formed a formidable middle order batting line up for Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|A sweep is a cross-batted {{front foot}} shot played {{to a low}} {{bouncing}} ball, usually from a slow bowler, by kneeling <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee,</b> bringing the head down {{in line with the}} ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, sweeping it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batsman to sweep the ball to the legside from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to note that traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox service has no kneeling in the Western sense of standing <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>knees.</b> While kneeling for prayer was customary in the primitive church, the Byzantine tradition did not maintain it, and the people stood traditionally. In the 20th century in some western countries, some Eastern Orthodox churches have begun to use pews and kneelers and so have begun kneeling {{in some parts of the}} service.|$|R
5000|$|Rukūʿ (رُكوع) {{refers to}} a {{paragraph}} of the holy book Qur'an. There are 558 or in some books there are 540 Rukus in Holy Quran. In prayer {{it refers to the}} bowing down from the standing position while praying according to Islamic ritual (salat). There is a consensus on the obligatory nature of the rukūʿ. The position of rukūʿ is established by bending over, putting <b>one's</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>knees,</b> and remaining in that position until the individual attains [...] "calmness".|$|R
25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to go down <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E

50|$|Locking was {{originally}} danced to traditional funk music, {{such as that}} produced or performed by James Brown. Funk music is still commonly favored by locking dancers, and used by many competitions such as the locking division of Juste Debout. Locking movements create a strong contrast towards the many fast moves that are otherwise performed quite continuously, combined with mime style performance and acting towards the audience and other dancers. Locking includes {{quite a lot of}} acrobatics and physically demanding moves, such as landing <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>knees</b> and the split. These moves often require knee protection of some sort.|$|R
