5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. In light of this, a group of 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed.

The morale of Monmouth's forces started to collapse as news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day, while the makeshift army was camped in Frome. Argyll's small force {{had been involved}} in minor skirmishes at Greenock and Ellangreig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed.|$|E

Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which {{the legality of the}} stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E

5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> his expensive foreign {{policies and the}} notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, {{as well as the}} role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.|$|E
5|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the negotiations, {{the conspirators}} succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic {{government of the}} Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating {{that they had not}} revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The {{main effect}} of the aid package was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support {{for the government to}} be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E

5|$|Troops of the 82nd Airborne began {{arriving}} around 02:30, {{with the primary}} objective of capturing two bridges over the River Merderet and destroying two bridges over the Douve. On {{the east side of}} the river, 75 per cent of the paratroopers landed in or near their drop zone, and within two hours they captured the important crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église (the first town liberated in the invasion) and began working to protect the western flank. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the pathfinders to accurately mark their drop zone, the two regiments dropped on the west side of the Merderet were extremely scattered, with only four per cent landing in the target area. Many landed in nearby swamps, with much loss of life. Paratroopers consolidated into small groups, usually a combination of men of various ranks from different units, and attempted to concentrate on nearby objectives. They captured but failed to hold the Merderet River bridge at La Fière, and fighting for the crossing continued for several days.|$|E
