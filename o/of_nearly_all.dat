5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

5|$|In 1963 Hydro-Québec {{purchased}} the shares <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in Québec and undertook {{construction of the}} Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric complex. To transmit the complex's annual production of about 30 billion kWh over a distance of nearly 700km, Hydro-Québec had to innovate. Led by Jean-Jacques Archambault, it became the first utility {{in the world to}} transmit electricity at 735 kV, rather than 300–400kV which was the world standard at that time. In 1962, Hydro-Québec proceeded with the construction of the first 735kV power line in the world. The line, stretching from the Manic-Outardes dam to the Levis substation, was brought into service on 29 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts {{made it impossible for}} him to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small gristmill, which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E
5|$|Losses had {{remained}} stable since the 1990s at 17–20% per year attributable {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E

5|$|Opposing the Allies was the German Army Group G (HeeresgruppeG). Although {{nominally}} an army group, Army GroupG had at {{the time}} of the invasion only one army under its command: the 19th Army, under the command of Friedrich Wiese. As southern France had never been important to German planning, their forces there had been stripped <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> their valuable units and equipment over the course of the war. Due to the Allied threat in Normandy Army Group G's units were continuously sent north until the Dragoon landings. The remaining 11 divisions were understrength and only one panzer division was left, the 11th Panzer Division. In early August the 11th Panzer Division had sent one of its two panzer battalions to Normandy shortly before the landing.|$|E
5|$|Remember Me is a {{cyberpunk}} action-adventure {{video game}} developed by Dontnod Entertainment {{and published by}} Capcom. It was released worldwide in June 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game's plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> her memories by megacorporation Memorize. With {{the help of a}} mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people's recollections. The combat consists of a modified combo system called Pressen.|$|E
5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification has become very rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify a question in 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to consider the case. Certified questions are also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E

5|$|The Brezhnev generation— {{the people}} who lived and worked during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> Soviet bureaucrats over the age of 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. This generation would rule the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev are prime examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|As chancellor, Hitler {{worked against}} {{attempts}} by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building. According to Kershaw, the consensus <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire. Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are {{of the opinion that}} the NSDAP itself was responsible. At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order. Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being hired}} after the {{completion}} <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the principal photography, Trumbull had {{an enormous amount of}} creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E
5|$|Heavy Syrian {{shelling}} of Degania Alef {{started at}} about 04:00 on May 20 from the Samakh police station, {{by means of}} 75mm cannons, and 60 and 81mm mortars. The barrage lasted about half an hour. At 04:30 on May 20, the Syrian army began its advance on the Deganias and the bridge over the Jordan River north of Degania Alef. Unlike the attack on Samakh (Tzemah), this action saw the participation <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the Syrian forces stationed at Tel al-Qasr, including infantry, armor and artillery. The Israeli defenders numbered about 70 persons (67 according to Aharon Israeli's head count), most of them not regular fighters, with some Haganah and Palmach members. Their orders were {{to fight to the}} death. They had support from three 20mm guns at Beit Yerah, deployed along the road from Samakh to Degania Alef. They also had a Davidka mortar, which exploded during the battle, and a PIAT with fifteen projectiles.|$|E
5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens <b>of</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E
