5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E

50|$|According to Jon Levenson, <b>the</b> writers <b>of</b> Hebrew Bible {{were well}} aware of evil as a {{theological}} problem, but he does not claim awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil. In contrast, according to Yair Hoffman, <b>the</b> ancient books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew Bible do not show an awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theological <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil, and even most later biblical scholars did not touch <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil. <b>The</b> earliest awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil in Judaism tradition is evidenced in extra- and post-biblical sources such as early Apocrypha (secret texts by unknown authors, which were not considered mainstream at the time they were written). The first systematic reflections on <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil by Jewish philosophers is traceable only in the medieval period.|$|R

5|$|Runrigs, of a furrow and ridge, usually ran {{downhill}} so {{that they}} included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land {{on an annual basis}} and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill. Key crops included kale (for both humans and animals), and hemp and flax for cloth production. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised primarily for meat. The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death, probably the bubonic plague, which reached Scotland in 1349 and killed perhaps over a third of the population, was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era, to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century. Towards the end of the period average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
