In conditions of product proliferation, in fact, the <b>order</b> acquisition and <b>fulfilment</b> process can {{turn out to be a}} serious bottleneck, as the multiplication of the product features induces an exponential growth in the volume of information exchanged between the firm sales organisation and its customer base. Furthermore, this information has to be fed back in appropriate formats to manufacturing, with the risk of errors and delays due to the variability and complexity of product information. This study, through the discussion of a case example, reports the first results from a research on a class of information systems that support the <b>order</b> acquisition and <b>fulfilment</b> process in high product variety environments, called product configuration systems. The research indicates that the implementation of a product configuration system significantly contributed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency with which the studied company translates the customer’s needs into product documentation. Moreover, the benefits pertaining to product configuration system stretch beyond operational performance, as it offers the company a way to incorporate into organisational memory product knowledge otherwise retained by individual employees.

40|$|The {{pace and}} extent of change in {{marketing}} landscape {{over the past decade}} has left many questioning the worth of marketing and its tenets. For many marketing educators it is a period of doubt and self-searching about the efficacy and role of the discipline. Yet empirical evidence reveals firms that have not only coped with these changing circumstances but have also found new and imaginative ways of winning competitive advantage. Marketing practice is adopting novel shapes and modes. In the field of management in general, new approaches to understanding and running organisations are being considered. One way of comprehending an organisation is to "unbundle" it into the key processes and activities that enable it to succeed. A number of such constituent processes are essentially about marketing and strongly dependant on marketing knowledge and competence. To add such a process-based view of marketing to more traditional perspectives, and to consider marketing in terms of four core processes - a marketing strategy process; a marketing managment process; an <b>order</b> generation, <b>fulfilment</b> and service process;and a new product development process - facilitates a reconceptualisation of how marketing is best managed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} ordering process between small suppliers and retailers {{and the role}} of the Internet in this process. Product <b>ordering</b> and <b>fulfilment</b> are both important components of a supply chain, of which suppliers and retailers are members. The Internet as an enabling technology has an important role to play in supply chains and therefore also in order processing. Internet technology facilitates Business-to-Business (B 2 B) transactions. Retailers and their suppliers collaborate to align production with customer demands. Internet-enabled B 2 B supports this collaboration between businesses, allowing them to gain knowledge about customer demands real-time. This enables them to determine the impact of these demands on their operations. Using the Internet has the advantage that it provides an ever present link that is less costly than private networks and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). When the Internet is used to facilitate trade and commerce between businesses, ecommerce is established. With Internet-enabled B 2 B (or B 2 B e-commerce), multiple suppliers are connected to multiple customers. This reduces production cycle times, reduces inventory, improves speed and quality of communications and reduces costs. This research investigates suppliers in the retail supply chain and focuses more specifically on small businesses due to their reported importance in the South African economy. They provide employment to a large portion of the country's population and contribute almost half to the economic activity. Small suppliers form part of supply chains and have to adhere to the demands exerted by larger supply chain members in order to be included in such supply chains. Small suppliers have just as an important role to fulfil in supply chains as larger companies. Small suppliers are also responsible for connecting and integrating supply chain members and in so doing, reduce costs...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} general {{understanding}} {{on the importance of}} supply chain integration (SCI), little is known regarding SCI operational issues and their impact on supplier commercial relationships and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> in public hospitals. In response, this thesis investigates the critical operational factors influencing the supply chain integration and their impact on supplier commercial relationships and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> in New Zealand public hospitals. This study explores critical SCI issues using the process-based management theory (approach) proposed by Lambert (2004, 2008). A new construct of focused SCI and a theoretical model have been developed for this study. A survey research approach was used to collect data. The results of empirical study are based on the responses from a survey with purchasing and supply personnel in public hospitals. This research tested eighteen hypotheses using multiple regression analysis. The results of this thesis support sixteen hypotheses proposed in the theoretical model and two hypotheses are not supported. The major findings of this research are that SCI operational issues in the hospitals, supplier commercial relationships, and focused SCI have positive influence on <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment.</b> Barriers to SCI (one of the operational issues) have negative influence on supplier commercial relationships, focused SCI, and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment.</b> The results for two hypotheses not supported in this thesis show that organisation environmental forces (suppliers or customers have initiated integration effort) do not have significant influence on focused SCI (integrated service functions, following national procurement policies and procedures). Also, organisation environmental forces do not have significant influence on supplier commercial relationships (reliable suppliers and good process integration between suppliers, customers and the DHB). The results of the rejected hypotheses indicate that integration initiated by suppliers or customers do not have impact on the organisation's focused supply chain integration and supplier commercial relationships. Most of the critical barriers of supply chain integration identified in this study are consistent with the findings of Fawcett and Magnan (2001) and Fawcett, Magnan, and McCarter (2008). However, Fawcett and Magnan (2001) and Fawcett et al. (2008) found inappropriate information systems as the key barrier to effective SCI, whereas, this research identified lack of willingness to share information as the key barrier to effective SCI in the public hospitals. Overall, this research provides significant contributions to the SCI, supplier commercial relationships, and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> literature and the practices of SCI in New Zealand public hospitals. This research also contributes to theoretical and practical knowledge by providing a new model for enhancing SCI in an organisation. The model can help researchers and managers to focus on important SCI, supplier commercial relationships, and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> factors. The critical SCI operational factors linkage to supplier commercial relationships, focused SCI, and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> has been tested for the first time. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners can use a survey instrument developed and tested in this study for understanding operational SCI factors, supplier commercial relationships and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> in the organisations. This study also provides practitioners with key recommendations to enhance SCI in an organisation, such as recognising procurement as a strategic function, the importance of support from top management, and the need to cement relationships with critical suppliers...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{developmental}} and {{comparative study of}} marriage in the novels of Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence. Although this subject is frequently alluded to in recent criticism of both authors, it is rarely discussed in detail. The main interest of the study here is to show how marriage and its sub-themes of love, sex and women, as well as society's perceptions {{of them in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly in the period between 1870 and 1930, have developed in their social and psychological dimensions, and how these developments are reflected in the novels. Partly for biographical reasons Hardy and Lawrence have different motives in exploring the theme of marriage: one seeks to deconstruct it for its failure to bring fulfilment to husband and wife, the other attempts to reconstruct it anew in <b>order</b> to bring <b>fulfilment</b> to man and woman's relationship. This approach is reflected in the thesis by dividing it into three major parts: Part one is concerned with marriage in reality as it was understood by society and experienced by Hardy and Lawrence; Part two deals with marriage from two points of view; and Part three is allotted to the consideration of marital patterns. While Chapter one surveys the social history of the period and the conceptual changes in the institution of marriage which took place in English society, Chapter two shows how these changes are reflected in the lives of Hardy and Lawrence, particularly in their relationships with women. As a transitional link between reality and fiction, Chapter three examines marriage in two "autobiographical" novels, 'The Return of the Native and Sons and Lovers, in order to show the novelists' conscious and unconscious perceptions of their strong attachments to their mothers and the influence of this on their love and marriage relationships. The following two chapters investigate the presentation of marriage from two different points of view. To demonstrate how Hardy and Lawrence use different methods to tackle the issue of marriage, Chapter four discusses marriage from a female point of view in Far from the Madding Crowd, the Woodlanders and the Rainbow. Chapter five examines marriage from a male point of view in the Mayor of Casterbridge, Aaron's Rod and "The Captain's Doll", trying to show how important it is for the individual to reconcile his 'male' and 'female' elements in marriage. Chapters six and seven examine how Hardy and Lawrence, by the use of a similar marital pattern, reach opposite conclusions which justify their intentions, the sixth chapter focusing on Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Women in Love, the seventh on Jude the Obscure and Lady Chatterley's Lover...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} the {{technology}} development electronic retailers (e-tailers) are experiencing extensive pressure on delivering products and services more rapidly than before. In turn, substantial pressure is placed on providing efficient e-fulfilment, which is also {{considered to be the}} most complex task of an e-tailer. To improve the <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> efficiency, e-tailers commonly transfer the <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> to another actor. This may be performed by outsourcing the warehouse to a third-party logistics provider (3 PL) or by drop shipping, where the distributor ships individual orders directly to customers. Albeit drop shipping’s recognition among e-tailers, there is no consensus whether drop shipping could be directly related to outsourcing. The report undertakes a qualitative research approach with a case study at Dustin, a leading IT and consumer electronics e-tailer (CEE) in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine if a potential relationship exists among drop shipping and outsourcing. Thus, contribute to the research within outsourced <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> strategies in the IT and consumer electronics sector. The empirical results have been gathered through interviews and observations at Dustin’s central warehouse. The findings indicate that drop shipping and outsourcing have similar characteristics and are used to accomplish equivalent outcomes. However, it is uncertain to what extent drop shipping and outsourcing management are interrelated. Due to the specific business characteristics of a CEE, drop shipping could be difficult to apply as a sole <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> method. Therefore, a dual strategy where drop shipping is used as an extension to the own warehouse could be ideal for a CEE...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{products}} are mostly perishable and require special logistics operations for storage, transportation and distribution to guarantee {{food safety and}} freshness. Logistics integration is critical for improving perishable food distribution. Although successful logistics integration has offered competitive advantage to firms operating {{in a wide range}} of industries, it has not yet achieved its full potential in the Thai agricultural sector. In Thailand, semi-industrial (commonly referred to as small and medium sized in extant literature) egg industry as an important agricultural sector. However, the industry presently faces critical issues primarily stemming from inadequate logistics. This results in suboptimal performance, such as unreliable delivery of goods and long or unpredictable <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> lead times. Empirical evidence indicates that lack of comprehensive logistics supply chain and the absence of full integration of all related processes are the cause of these issues. On the other hand, in the extant studies in this field, factors such as information integration, logistics operations coordination, organisational relationship, and institutional support, are posited to play the main role in logistics integration. Hence, the present study aims to examine the role of these logistics integration factors in the ability to improve the logistics performance (specifically perfect <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> and <b>order</b> <b>fulfilment</b> lead times), and identify the factors that have the potential to significantly affect the above relationships.
