500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> this year, but his plate was full there for a while. We think we have a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Ron and Tammys", Chris helps Ann shoot a {{health-related}} PSA. His {{determination to}} make it perfect, filming take after take, reminds Ann of some of her reasons not to date him. In [...] "Pawnee Rangers", Chris meets Jerry's daughter Millicent (Sarah Wright). The two start dating and Chris makes {{sure that it is}} okay with Jerry. Jerry says that he is fine with the two of them dating, much to Chris' delight. Chris and Millicent go together to April and Andy's Halloween party, with Chris dressing as Sherlock Holmes, his favorite character. [...] After Chris starts to lose contact with Millie, he enlists Jerry, Donna, and Ann to help him, against Jerry's wishes. Ann tells him that he is too accessible and needs to back <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> so he can continue dating Millie. In [...] "Bowling for Votes", Millie dumps Chris, leaving him depressed. [...] In [...] "Operation Ann", Leslie convinces Chris that he is still a likable person and that Millecent's opinion does not mean anything. [...] He immediately loses his depression. [...] In [...] "Dave Returns", Chris discovers Tom's relationship with Ann and confronts Tom about it, making Chris realize that he has to [...] "...adjust." [...] He then freezes and stares sadly into space. [...] In the same episode, when Andy, asks Chris to sing for him (since he is working as a backing vocalist on Andy's song for the campaign), he sings [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" [...] out of tune and with the wrong lyrics, causing everyone else there to wince. Chris helps Leslie's campaign however he can, even taking on a large amount of busy work to distract him from his loneliness [...] "Bus Tour". He has a brief liaison with Bobby Newport's campaign manager, which cheers him up.|$|E

[...] He went on to contrast the song from other tracks from J's debut album Who You Are, calling it less aggressive and more [...] "about the positive vibes." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the song to Miley Cyrus's [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] (2009), which was co-written by Jessie J. He said, [...] "Truth be told, 'Price Tag' does come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> corny, but thanks in no small part to Jessie's spunky likability" [...] and described it as a [...] "sun-dappled, hip-hop-inflected midtempo head-nodder".|$|E
2500|$|Details {{regarding}} the album were sparse; {{completion of the}} album was announced via a blog post on 8 July 2006. While the record was in the writing and recording stages, some band members were based in New York City and others in Los Angeles. Aaron Turner later confessed that the album [...] "suffered" [...] due to this situation. Jeff Caxide also felt discontent and dissatisfaction with the album, stating that In the Absence of Truth was “the kind of record I listen to and think ‘that could be better, {{and that could be}} better, and that could be better,’ and I think we all kind of felt that way”. Drummer Aaron Harris felt that the band pushed themselves too far musically, too; having learned a wealth of new techniques prior to its recording, he says he “grew so much as a drummer [...] that it was overwhelming even for me.” He continues: “I think I was trying to show <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> [...] I think everybody was.” The eventual record proved dissatisfactory, with him opining that “some of it sounded a bit jumbled. I think a lot of things were happening that we didn't know what to do with.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Like {{his method}} of musical contribution, music styles {{attributed}} to Lanny Wolfe were also varied. His original music {{picked up on}} styles within pop culture, and often included the soft, symphonic style of pop music during the 1970s. In his song, I Feel Good, he even pulled <b>off</b> adapting <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the [...] "James Brown Sound" [...] to that up-tempo song.

60|$|But {{this time}} the Fairy had watched the Prince's {{movements}} from her window, and she saw him hiding himself behind the rock with her daughter. She uttered a piercing shriek so that the mountains re-echoed {{with the sound of}} it, and the terrified pair had hardly dared to look out from their hiding-place when the enraged woman, with her dress and hair flying in the wind, hurried over the bridge of clouds. The Prince at once gave himself up for lost, but the girl told him to be of good courage and to follow her as quickly as he could. But before they left their shelter she broke <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the rock, spoke some magic words over it, and threw it in the direction her mother was coming from. In a moment a glittering palace arose before the eyes of the Fairy which blinded her with its dazzling splendour, and with its many doors and passages prevented her for some time from finding her way out of it.|$|E
60|$|We soon {{reached the}} Church of St. Mary of the Angels, {{which is a}} modern structure, and very spacious, built in place of one {{destroyed}} by an earthquake. It is a fine church, opening out a magnificent space in its nave and aisles; and beneath the great dome stands the small old chapel, with its rude stone walls, in which St. Francis founded his order. This chapel and the dome {{appear to have been}} the only portions of the ancient church that were not destroyed by the earthquake. The dwelling of St. Francis is said to be also preserved within the church; but we did not see it, unless it were a little dark closet into which we squeezed to see some frescos by La Spagna. It had an old wooden door, of which U---- picked <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a chip, to serve as a relic. There is a fresco in the church, on the pediment of the chapel, by Overbeck, representing the Assumption of the Virgin. It did not strike me as wonderfully fine. The other pictures, of which there were many, were modern, and of no great merit.|$|E
5000|$|Karai plays {{only a minor}} role in the film, [...] {{which came}} as a {{disappointment}} for some reviewers and commentators.

At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it. And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them. They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar. [...] "Now we'll set to," [...] said Hansel, [...] "and have a regular blow-out.(1) I'll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel, can eat some of the window, which you'll find a sweet morsel."

Now, we take the light approach as far as trying to drive home a joke with audience reaction.

50|$|In {{the realms}} of finance, the glass ceiling can be seen through trends, new CEOs, and stock performance.

In 2002, this increased tapered <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> For male CEOs, they have increased from 1992 to 1999, and since then male CEOs have decreased. An interesting observation from this chart will reveal that when the female increase in CEOs tapered starting in 2002, the male CEOs continued to decline.

In a rough finish, Hibaayeb hung to the left in the closing stages before prevailing by three quarters of a length from Lady Darshaan with You'll Be Mine a length and a half away in third place.

Callan commented [...] "I was always pretty confident. I got a lovely run, she stretched away and quickened away like she was going to win by a couple of lengths, but she's pricked her ears.
