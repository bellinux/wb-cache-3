50|$|The second {{gold rush}} period was {{dominated}} by large companies, who continued buying up smaller claims, and hiring locals to mine and operate the stamp mills and machinery. Individual consignment miners, known as tributors, worked claims as well. The province {{became known as the}} place of “rich man’s diggings” due to the large costs involved in deep mines working lower grade ore. Capital investment, often American and British, and the improved technology needed to build and operate the mines ballooned into a multimillion-dollar industry. This period is considered the golden age of gold mining in Nova Scotia. Production exceeded 20,000 ounces per year for sixteen years and in three of those years exceeded 30,000 ounces annually (1898, 1900, 1901.) Along with racking up the highest yields per year, this period is noted more for <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> than feverish hysteria.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaintenance {{and spare}} part {{logistics}} often determine {{the life cycle}} costs related to the usage phase of assets. Therefore, different maintenance strategies are known from literature and adopted by enterprises in order to cut these costs. Most often these strategies face problems due to uncertainties in processes and tasks. This paper suggests an adjusted preactive maintenance concept which implements autonomous control aspects in order to plan and control personnel, equipment, resources, etc. ad hoc and without hierarchical planning instances. In doing so, different well known strategies will be kept equitable within the concept but are replenished with an overall heterachical <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> and controlling approach. As a result, maintenance objects themselves gain the opportunity to trigger maintenance measures, no matter whether it's a case of inspection, maintenance or repair, according to their particular requirements.

Production planning is crucial to this end and represents one of the most challenging tasks managers are facing today. Among a large number of alternatives, production planning processes help decision-making by tradingoff conflicting objectives in the presence of technological, marketing and financial constraints. Two important classes of such problems are lotsizing and scheduling. Proofs from complexity theory supported by computational experiments clearly show the hardness of solving lotsizing and scheduling problems. Motivated by a real-world case, the glass container industry production planning and scheduling problem is studied in depth. Due to its inherent complexity and to the frequent interdependencies between decisions that are made at and affect different organizational echelons, the system is decomposed into a two-level hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> structure: long-term and short-term levels. This dissertation explores extensions of lotsizing and scheduling problems that appear in both levels. We address these variants in two research directions. On one hand, we develop and implement different approaches to obtain good quality solutions, as metaheuristics (namely variable neighborhood search) and Lagrangian-based heuristics, as well as other special-purpose heuristics. On the other hand, we try to combine new stronger models and valid inequalities based on the polyhedral structure of these problems to tighten linear relaxations and speed up the solution process.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{beginnings}} of the urban planning and first <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> activities of Bulgarian cities {{at the turn of}} 19 th and 20 th centuries when many Czech engineers and architects participated in significantly. A common feature of all Bulgarian cities was irregular structure and build-up area. The main task of the Czech engineers was to cope with this situation and to design modern cities. In general, the original structure did not make planning easy and unambiguous. Planning of the cities destroyed in the Russian-Turkish war in 1877 - 78 was easier. A possibility to apply a new city structure freely existed in Stara Zagora and partially in Nova Zagora. A usual principle was straightening of the streets where the engineers used original street network and the new modern streets were built according to it, e. g. the centre of Kystendil and the old part of Nova Zagora. These principles were used also in some central parts of Sofia and Plovdiv. The city of Sofia itself is a distinctive example. Although the original structure was preserved during the war and in the first steps the principle of straightening of the streets in the centre was applied, the other parts of Sofia were designed with a new structure and the old city disappeared. Plovdiv is in contrary to Sofia and its original structure was preserved as an old city and the new one was joined to it in neighbourhoods...|$|E
40|$|Este artigo apresenta uma nova abordagem (MM-GAV-FBI), aplicável ao problema da programação de projectos com restrições de recursos e vários modos de execução por actividade, problema conhecido na {{literatura}} anglo-saxónica por MRCPSP. Cada projecto tem um conjunto de actividades com precedências tecnológicas definidas e um conjunto de recursos limitados, sendo que cada actividade pode ter mais do que um modo de realização. A programação dos projectos é realizada com recurso a um esquema de geração de planos (do inglês Schedule Generation Scheme - SGS) integrado com uma metaheurística. A metaheurística é baseada no paradigma dos algoritmos genéticos. As prioridades das actividades são obtidas a partir de um algoritmo genético. A representação cromossómica utilizada baseia-se em chaves aleatórias. O SGS gera planos não-atrasados. Após a obtenção de uma solução é aplicada uma melhoria local. O objectivo da abordagem é encontrar o melhor plano (planning), ou seja, o plano que tenha a menor duração temporal possível, satisfazendo as precedências das actividades e as restrições de recursos. A abordagem proposta é testada num conjunto de problemas retirados da literatura da especialidade e os resultados computacionais são comparados com outras abordagens. Os resultados computacionais validam o bom desempenho da abordagem, não apenas em termos de qualidade da solução, mas também em termos de tempo útil. As {{the complexity}} of projects increases, the requirement of an <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling process is enhanced. The need for <b>organized</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling of a construction project is influenced {{by a variety of}} factors (e. g., project size and number of project activities). To plan and schedule a construction project, activities must be defined sufficiently. The level of detail determines the number of activities contained within the project plan and schedule. So, finding feasible schedules which efficiently use scarce resources is a challenging task within project management. In this context, the well-known Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) has been studied during the last decades. In the RCPSP the activities of a project have to be scheduled such that the makespan of the project is minimized. So, the technological precedence constraints have to be observed as well as limitations of the renewable resources required to accomplish the activities. Once started, an activity may not be interrupted. This problem has been extended to a more realistic model, the multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP), where each activity can be performed in one out of several modes. Each mode of an activity represents an alternative way of combining different levels of resource requirements with a related duration. Each renewable resource has a limited availability such as manpower and machines for the entire project. The objective of the MRCPSP problem is minimizing the makespan. While the exact methods are available for providing optimal solution for small problems, its computation time is not feasible for large-scale problems. This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based approach (MM-GAV-FBI) for the multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem. The idea of this new approach is integrating a genetic algorithm with a schedule generation scheme. This study also proposes applying a local search procedure trying to improve the initial solution. The chromosome representation of the problem is based on random keys. The schedule is constructed using a schedule generation scheme (SGS) in which the priorities of the activities are defined by the genetic algorithm. The experimental results of MM-GAV-FBI on project instances show that this approach is an effective method for solving the MRCPSP...|$|E
