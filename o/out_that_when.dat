The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

Northern Californians pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the southern portions of the state experienced disasters, the state supported rebuilding, especially as seen in earthquake rebuilding of freeways and the subsequent seismic retrofit of state freeway structures and bridges. Since the objective of the replacement of the eastern span is to prevent the necessity of complete rebuilding after a large earthquake, Bay Area residents felt justified in their call for state support.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women {{would have to}} be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E

25|$|Although his {{sentence}} {{was not the}} death penalty, Einhorn's defense attorneys argued that Einhorn would {{face the death penalty}} if he was returned to the United States. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that the death penalty will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the murder occurred, Pennsylvania did not have the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the US and the Pennsylvania constitutions forbid ex post facto law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the European Court of Human Rights, which require a new trial when the defendant was tried in absentia and unable to present his defense. On this basis, the court of appeals of Bordeaux rejected the extradition request.|$|E

500|$|Humphrey Atherton's {{date and}} place of birth are uncertain. [...] It has been presumed by some that {{he was born in}} Lancashire, England, because the name Atherton is {{prominent}} there. [...] However, genealogist Robert Charles Anderson, in The Great Migration, states that this [...] "does not come close to constituting proof of origin." [...] The date of 1608 is sometimes given as his date of birth because Edmund Atherton of Wigan Lancashire, England died in 1612 leaving, as his heir, a four-year-old son named Humphrey. [...] However, Duane Hamilton Hurd, in History of Norfolk County, Massachusetts stated that Atherton was 36 years old when he died in 1661. On the other hand, Charles Samuel Hall in Hall Ancestry, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Atherton was made freeman and was granted property in 1638, [...] "he must at that time reached his majority." ...|$|E
500|$|The High Court also {{examined}} {{a number of}} related propositions. In particular, they pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> interpreting the legislation which established legal aid services, Australian courts did not recognise an absolute right to counsel in all circumstances, and thus the State {{does not need to}} provide counsel {{for the duration of the}} trial. The court also raised the question of what a right to counsel would actually mean in practice: that is, would a right to counsel at public expense entitle a person to counsel of a certain degree of experience? Furthermore, the court suggested that having a right to representation would necessarily imply that a trial conducted without the accused being legally represented would necessarily be unfair, an idea which has been rejected by the Australian courts. The accused must have lost a [...] "real chance of acquittal" [...] before a trial can be regarded as unfair. Essentially, Australian common law recognised a right to a fair trial, but the question of whether the lack of representation caused an unfair trial had to be based on the particular circumstances of each case.|$|E
2500|$|The anthropic principle, {{at least}} as Carter {{conceived}} it, can be applied on scales {{much smaller than the}} whole universe.

He depended upon witness intimidation and the reluctance of the government to prosecute a well-known religious figure for protection against prosecution.

2500|$|After {{playing in}} the 1962 Interzonal in Stockholm, Petrosian {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao along with Pal Benko, Miroslav Filip, Bobby Fischer, Efim Geller, Paul Keres, Viktor Korchnoi, and Mikhail Tal. Petrosian, representing the Soviet Union, won the tournament with a final score of 17½ points, followed by fellow Soviets Geller and Keres each with 17 points and the American Fischer with 14. Fischer later accused the Soviet players of arranging draws and having [...] "ganged up" [...] on him {{to prevent him from}} winning the tournament. As evidence for this claim, he noted that all 12 games played between Petrosian, Geller, and Keres were draws. Statisticians pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> playing against each other, these Soviet competitors averaged 19 moves per game, as opposed to 39.5 moves when playing against other competitors. Although responses to Fischer's allegations were mixed, FIDE later adjusted the rules and format to try to prevent future collusion in the Candidates matches.|$|E

2500|$|From the 60s AD female gladiators {{appear as}} rare and [...] "exotic markers of {{exceptionally}} lavish spectacle". In 66 AD, Nero had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a munus to impress King Tiridates I of Armenia. Romans {{seem to have}} found {{the idea of a}} female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named [...] "Mevia", hunting boars in the arena [...] "with spear in hand and breasts exposed", and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose munus includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot. A munus of 89 AD, during Domitian's reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as [...] "Amazons". In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named [...] "Amazon" [...] and [...] "Achillia"; their match ended in a draw. In the same century, an epigraph praises one of Ostia's local elite as the first to [...] "arm women" [...] in the history of its games. Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts. Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. Cassius Dio takes pains to point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the much admired emperor Titus used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.|$|E
2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. This is how he described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, and that we would sit at a negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, I ask him whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He keeps saying that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 October 1570, {{having taken}} leave of Queen Elizabeth {{and his other}} friends at Court, Châtillon set off for Southampton, {{intending}} to cross to France. He was preparing to go from England to La Rochelle to join his brother. Bad weather, however, prevented him from embarking, and in the meantime, on 29 October, he was granted the Freedom of Southampton by the burgesses. On November 10 he was still prevented from crossing, a fire having broken out in the ship he was to use, and he decided therefore to change his plans and to go to Picardy instead of La Rochelle, [...] though at that point he was impeded by the very bad health of his wife. [...] He returned to London, where he joined the French Ambassador de la Mothe Fénelon in discussions {{on the subject of}} the proposed marriage of the 19 year old Francis, Duke of Anjou and Alençon, to the thirty-seven year old Elizabeth. [...] On 6 December the Cardinal left London for Canterbury, though in mid-January 1571 he was back at the English Court and discussions on the Anjou marriage continued. [...] On 25 January he left London again, and not in good health. He grew worse, and at the end of February he was suffering from 'fits'. [...] On 2 March, Henry Killibrew wrote to his employer Cecil that he had just tried to see the Cardinal, who at first could not receive him, but later in the day he was sent for and found the Cardinal 'weak and faint'. [...] On 13 March Lord Cobham in London wrote to Dover Castle that the Cardinal was attempting to arrange a stay in an execution there, until he could plead at Court, which, the Cardinal said, would be very soon. [...] But on the evening of 21 March 1571, the Cardinal lost the ability to speak, and shortly thereafter died. [...] He died at the former pilgrims' lodge at Canterbury under mysterious circumstances (possibly poisoned by his servant, perhaps on the orders of the French government). [...] Queen Elizabeth ordered a Commission of Inquiry into the cause of his death. [...] The Cardinal's wife gave testimony that she believed that he had been given slow poison, and that the proof was in his perforated stomach, discovered at the autopsy. [...] This, however, was most definitely not the opinion of the Cardinal's physicians. [...] The doctors pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the body was opened, the lungs and liver were also damaged; the stomach, however, was 'raw'. But the Commission could find no evidence of a poisoner, and would not have considered poisoning, had it not been for the insistence of Lady Châtillon.|$|E
