40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the use of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) in the European Union Member States, the European Commission, on the initiative of Commissioner E. Liikannen, launched in December 1999 a bold programme called “eEurope”. Soon after its creation, the eEurope programme was integrated into the so- called Lisbon agenda for Europe to become the “most advanced knowledge based economy” in the world. We try to assess if the programme is successful in achieving its stated objective of promoting a knowledge based economy through the development of an “information society for all”. First, we conclude that eEurope, due to its <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> its <b>procedures,</b> has intrinsic limits both as regards its scope and effectiveness. Second, we show how Member States have adopted different trajectories towards the “knowledge based society”. To identify these heterogeneous paths of growth, we have selected a set of variables that, combined together, represent the institutional arrangements specific to a country or a group of countries. We found sharp differences between two advanced models that we label, respectively, as Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon. Without asserting the superiority of a model, we propose policy orientations to help Europe overcome those gaps hindering the move towards knowledge economies where information society technologies are widely diffused...|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} in which climate changes due to the {{continuous}} and out of control use of fossil fuels are becoming always more significant, {{it is very important to}} try to foster energy conversion systems with a lower environmental impact such as FC-based cogenerative systems. With the necessary precautions, this kind of systems can be feed with a wide range of fuels, from the most conventional, such as hydrogen and natural gas, to those produced from renewable sources, such as biogas or gasification gas. Unfortunately, most of these fuels contains traces of elements that result to be detrimental for FC-based systems operation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chocolate {{properties}} {{can vary}} depending on cocoa <b>origin,</b> composition <b>and</b> manufacturing <b>procedure,</b> which affect consumer acceptability. The aim of this work was to study the effect of two cocoa <b>origins</b> (Ghana <b>and</b> Ecuador) and two processing conditions (roasting time and conching time) on dark chocolate acceptability. RESULTS: Overall acceptability and acceptability for different attributes (colour, flavour, odour and texture) were evaluated by 95 consumers. Differences in acceptability among dark chocolates were mainly related to differences in flavour acceptability. The use of a long roasting time lowered chocolate acceptability in Ghanaian samples while it {{had no effect on}} acceptability of Ecuadorian chocolates. This responsewas observed for most consumers (two subgroupswith different frequency consumption of dark chocolate). However, for a third group of consumers identified as distinguishers, the most acceptable dark chocolate samples were those produced with specific combinations of roasting time and conching time for each of the cocoa geographical origin considered.

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal {{secondary}} metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. It has been detected {{in a wide}} range of commodities, including cereals, coffee, grapes, raisins, must and wine. Within grape derivative products, the raisins, red wine and sweet wines have reported to contain the highest OTA levels. Aspergillus section Nigri (A. niger and A. carbonarius) are considered the OTA source in these commodities and they are commonly isolated among other fungi from grapes and raisins. Starting from this basis the objectives of this thesis were focused into three main aspects: (1) Evaluation of the food products: vine dried fruits and special wines, concerning the mycobiota and OTA occurrence and incidence; (2) Ecophysiological studies of the ochratoxigenic fungi and accompanying mycobiota as affected by environmental conditions; (3) Control and preventive methods such as the evaluation of residual activity of pre-harvest fungicides during grape dehydration and the use of modified atmospheres. Wine <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> winemaking <b>procedure</b> showed to be determinant for the final OTA content. All special wines analysed from northern European regions were negative for OTA while more than 50 % of wines from warmer regions were positive for OTA contamination. The wines with higher OTA levels were fortified musts followed by those made from dried grapes. Acoholic and malo-lactic fermentations, biological 'crianza' (Flor yeast) and the action of Botrytis cinerea in noble rot of grapes may diminish the OTA levels in wine. In grapes, the presence of Aspergillus section Nigri became predominant at harvest and mainly during sun-drying. Prevalence of Aspergillus section Nigri can be explained by their adaptation to environmental conditions of sun-drying, and by their ability to dominate other fungal species involved when coming into contact with them. Among the Aspergillus section Nigri, A. niger aggregate was dominant, although A. carbonarius increased its inc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to show the {{possibilities}} of chemometric tools and the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model, {{as well as to}} understand the complexities of the fluorescence emission-excitation matrix (EEM) of water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) extracted from sewage sludge samples obtained with different <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> stabilization <b>procedures.</b> The variation in the composition of WSOM in the different sewage sludge samples could be correlated with the conditions of stabilization; therefore, the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor these changes can be a useful tool to optimize the management of this residual flux, avoiding environmental pollution. However, the “contour density” EEM maps obtained with fluorescence present continuous spectra with different peaks, valleys, and shoulders where manual peak picking can be complicated and subjective, especially in complex matrixes such as sewage sludge. With the PARAFAC algorithm, it is possible to resolve the emission and excitation spectra of the different fluorescence components present in the samples and their contribution to the total fluorescence. Also, the contribution (scores) of the different fluorophors can be coupled with another chemometric tool to provide an effective classification method using the stabilization conditions of sewage sludge as main criterion. In this study, a wide survey of sewage sludge samples (287) was characterized by fluorescence emission-excitation matrix. The final molecular composition of the sewage sludge samples was not related to the stabilization (aerobic vs anaerobic) treatments. However, a sewage sludge classification based on a combined spectroscopic-chemometric approach was obtained, which could be used for the optimization of sewage sludge use in agriculture, minimizing the environmental risks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the size, structure and scaling relationships in glycogen isolated from five different animal sources. For this purpose a versatile fractionation technique, asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF), coupled to multi-angle light scattering, is utilized. For {{determination of the}} average degree of branching (1) H NMR is utilized. The results give a detailed insight into the physico-chemical properties of glycogen over the whole size distribution. The results show that glycogen is a hyper branched macromolecule with wide size distributions, and in some samples two major populations are clearly observed which most likely correspond to Î²- and Î±-particles of glycogen. The results also illustrates that glycogen is a polysaccharide showing rather diverse conformational properties, over the size distribution, depending on its <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> the extraction <b>procedure.</b> The ratio between root-mean-square radius and hydrodynamic radius varies depending of both sample origin the molar mass of the macromolecules, reflecting differences in conformation and scaling within the size distribution.

In reality the' sexual molesting {{of children}} has a long history throughout many centuries. Sexual child molesting is currently prominently in the forefront since the exposure of this phenomenon in 1988. The South African Police have established Child Protection units country-wide to establish a support system with regard to combatting this phenomenon. Two aims of this study are, amongst others, specifically to determine the profile of the child molester and to determine the <b>origin,</b> functioning <b>and</b> <b>procedure</b> of the Child Protection unit of the South African Police. This study is primarily of an investigative nature since it is aimed at obtaining insight and gaining understanding. The study can also be defined as self-initiated research due to the researcher's interest in the phe,nomenon of child molesting as such. The most important methods followed to realize this study were that firstly a thorough literature study was conducted. Secondly, a pilot investigation was carried out by means of a structured questionnaire that was completed by members of the Child Protection unit of the South African Police in Johannesburg. Four questionnaires were completed and in such a way deficiencies could be identified and eliminated. This structured questionnaire was sent country-wide for completion by Child Protection units.

40|$|According to the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), {{more than}} 3. 1 {{billion tons of}} {{hazardous}} materials (HazMat) are shipped within the country annually. This averages to about 800, 000 individual shipments of hazardous materials per day, of which 300, 000 are shipments of petroleum/flammable-combustible liquids. This paper presents a temporal trend study (1995 - 2004) of 1, 850 HazMat incidents occurring through the transportation of flammable-combustible liquids. The study was centered about HazMat shipments originating within five states (California, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Texas) chosen for their geographic variations in size and location. The main objective {{of this study is}} to conduct a frequency analysis of HazMat incident as a function of distance between <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> incident location. <b>Procedures</b> for this study entailed compiling a sample of HazMat road incidents originating within the selected states and generating the great-circle distance from their originating location to sites of incident. The distance between <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> incident locations were attained through great-circle calculations because data compilation did not allow for the identification of specific routes utilized in commodity transport. Key findings of the analysis illustrated a bimodal distribution of incident frequency as a function of the great-circle log distance. The first mode presented an average distance of incident which was short haul in classification. The second mode presented an average distance of incident which was long-haul in classification. The study also addressed incidents as they occurred within primary phases within transportation. For all phases, incidents occurred at average distances which are long haul in classification. Time series forecasting suggests continuing trends in HazMat incidents. Findings of this study speculate fatigue to be a contributing factor for incident occurrences. This requires that more research be carried out on various aspects of flammable-combustible liquids such as hours-of-service regulations, fatigue and incident reporting...|$|R
