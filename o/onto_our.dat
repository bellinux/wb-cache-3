500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime.

6000|$|And now I come {{rapidly to}} the {{conclusion}} of this singular narrative, in which I have {{tried to make the}} reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton {{to the point where they}} had found a pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour <b>onto</b> <b>our</b> faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. [...] "Meyers, Toronto," [...] was printed on the leather inside.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—When {{designing}} DSP {{applications for}} implementation on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), {{it is often}} important to minimize consumption of limited FPGA resources while satisfying real-time performance constraints. In this paper, we develop efficient techniques to determine dataflow graph buffer sizes that guarantee throughput-optimal execution when mapping synchronous dataflow (SDF) representations of DSP applications <b>onto</b> FPGAs. <b>Our</b> techniques {{are based on a}} novel two-actor SDF graph Model (TASM), which efficiently captures the behavior and costs associated with SDF graph edges (flowgraph connections). With our proposed techniques, designers can automatically generate upper bounds on SDF graph buffer distributions that realize maximum achievable throughput performance for the corresponding applications.

The novelty of our strategy is in the use of STS probes made from both ends of cosmid clones, {{selected on the basis of}} ''sample without replacement'' (only library clones that show no previous positive hybridization are selected and made into probes). We developed powerful techniques, based on consistency analysis, for error detection and contig assembly. In addition, we probed our library with genetically mapped markers and NotI or SfiI linking clones, thereby anchoring contigs <b>onto</b> chromosomes. <b>Our</b> map contains more than 1000 sites, including genes (most were previously unmapped), occurrences of known repetitive elements, and NotI-SfiI restriction sites...|$|R

This paper studies the use of cache locking on massive multi-core architectures with private caches {{in the context of}} hard real-time systems. In shared cache architectures, a single resource is shared among all the tasks. However, in scalable cache architectures with private caches, conflicts exist only among the tasks scheduled on one core.

After relaxing the geometric constraints of rigid motions, we derive a simple closed-form solution based on a spectral decomposition, which is then projected <b>onto</b> SE(3). <b>Our</b> formulation is extremely efficient, as rigid-motion synchronization is cast to an eigenvalue decomposition problem. Robustness to outliers is gained through Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares. Besides providing a theoretically appealing solution, since our method recovers {{at the same time}} both rotations and translations, we demonstrate through experimental results that our approach is significantly faster than the state of the art, while providing accurate estimates of rigid motions...|$|R

Finally we show that credit constraints and market risk cause outsourcing to dominate in house provision. ...|$|R
