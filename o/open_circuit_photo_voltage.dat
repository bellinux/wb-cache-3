40|$|Feasibility and {{practicality}} of a {{solar cell}} {{consisting of a}} semiconductor surface in contact with an electrolyte are evaluated. Basic components and processes are detailed for photovoltaic energy conversion at the surface of an n-type semiconductor in contact with an electrolyte which is oxidizing to conduction band electrons. Characteristics of single crystal CdS, GaAs, CdSe, CdTe and thin film CdS in contact with aqueous and methanol based electrolytes are studied and <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> voltages are measured from Mott-Schottky plots and <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>photo</b> <b>voltages.</b> Quantum efficiencies for short <b>circuit</b> <b>photo</b> currents of a CdS crystal and a 20 micrometer film are shown together with electrical and photovoltaic properties.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} a vertical parallel junction under constant multispectral light has been made. By using a new approach of the carrier generation rate we determine the recombination and electrical parameters.

25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (a diode) yields a forward <b>voltage,</b> the <b>photo</b> <b>voltage,</b> between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> that drives current through any attached load.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{photovoltaic}} device {{application of}} bromothymol blue (BTB) as an organic interlayer has been reported. After Al back contact fabrication {{on the surface}} of the chemically cleaned substrate by thermal evaporation method, the organic interlayer has been grown on p-Si substrate via spin coating technique. Al top contacts have been formed on this organic thin film to finalize the device constructions. The different illumination intensities were exposed to the prepared sample for the enhancement in the photovoltaic properties of device. The fundamental photovoltaic parameters such as <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc) and output power (P) were determined for the device under different illuminations. The photocurrent and the <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> have been increased with the increasing in illumination intensity. The dependence of the capacitance on the voltage at high and low frequency has been also reported for the studied device. Consequently, it has been confirmed that the illumination intensity has an important influence on the photovoltaic parameters of the device...|$|R
40|$|The Teraherz (THz) {{photoresponse}} of {{a two-dimensional}} electron gas in the quantum Hall regime is investigated. We use a sample structure which is topologically equivalent to a Corbino geometry combined with a cross-gate technique. This quasi-Corbino geometry allows us to directly investigate the THz-induced transport between adjacent edge-states, thus avoiding bulk effects. We find a pronounced <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> at zero applied bias, which rapidly decreases when an external current bias is applied. The <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> and its dependence on the bias current can be described using the model of an illuminated photodiode, resulting from {{the reconstruction of the}} Landau bands at the sample edge. Using the sample as a detector in a Fourier transform spectrometer setup, we find a resonant response from which we extract a reduced effective cyclotron mass. The findings support a non-bolometric mechanism of the induced <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> and the proposed edge-channel diode model. Comment: 5 pages, 5 eps-figures, accepted for Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

2500|$|The diode {{possesses}} a [...] "built-in potential" [...] {{due to the}} contact potential {{difference between the two}} different materials {{on either side of the}} junction. This built-in potential is established when the junction is manufactured and that voltage a by-product of thermodynamic equilibrium within the cell. Once established, this potential difference cannot drive a current, however, as connecting a load does not upset this equilibrium. [...] In contrast, the accumulation of excess electrons in one region and of excess holes in another, due to illumination, results in a <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> that does drive a current when a load is attached to the illuminated diode. As noted above, this <b>photo</b> <b>voltage</b> also forward biases the junction, and so reduces the pre-existing field in the depletion region.|$|R

5000|$|Stubs may be {{lengthened}} {{in order}} to change from an <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> to a short circuit stub and vice versa. [...] Low-pass filters usually consist of series inductors and shunt capacitors. Applying Kuroda's identities will convert these to all shunt capacitors, which are <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> stubs. <b>Open</b> <b>circuit</b> stubs are preferred in printed technologies because they are easier to implement, {{and this is the}} technology likely to be found in consumer products. However, {{this is not the case}} in other technologies such as coaxial line, or twin-lead where the short circuit may actually be helpful for mechanical support of the structure. Short circuits also have a small advantage in that they are generally have a more precise position than <b>open</b> <b>circuits.</b> If the circuit is to be further transformed into the waveguide medium then <b>open</b> <b>circuits</b> are out of the question because there would be radiation out of the aperture so formed. For a high-pass filter the inverse applies, applying Kuroda will naturally result in short circuit stubs and it may be desirable for a printed design to convert to <b>open</b> <b>circuits.</b> As an example, a λ/8 <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> stub can be replaced with a 3λ/8 short circuit stub of the same characteristic impedance without changing the circuit functionally.|$|R

However, electrodes degrade over time, and the <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> voltage cannot be calculated during electrode degradation because the <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> voltage remains unchanged.

50|$|Analysis of {{probability}} failure trees for <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> scuba shows {{that use of}} a parallel or redundant system reduces risk considerably more than improving the reliability of components in a single critical system.

25|$|In rebreather diving, bailout to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> is a {{procedure}} where the diver switches from breathing from the rebreather loop to <b>open</b> <b>circuit.</b> This is done when the loop is compromised for any reason, {{and is often}} done temporarily when there is some doubt that the gas in the loop is right for the depth. Bailout to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> may be a local switch-over at the bailout valve (BOV) to breathe gas directly from the diluent cylinder, or may be a switch to off-board gas, which is carried in an independent cylinder and is directly equivalent to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> bailout. This may be done through an off-board supply connected to the BOV or through a regular fully independent bailout set carried for the purpose.
