The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way <b>of</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by George Kamitani as first a sequel {{and then a}} spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown.

The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes as if on a stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means <b>of</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> issues both players and staff had with the original game while keeping the story intact.
