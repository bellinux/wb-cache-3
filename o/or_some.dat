5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian <b>or</b> <b>some</b> other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community <b>or</b> <b>some</b> other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills <b>or</b> <b>some</b> storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole.

5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy <b>or</b> <b>some</b> {{other aspect of}} botanical science. In principle, their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants {{for the purposes of}} scientific research, conservation, display, and education, although this will depend on the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems {{are even}} smaller may be {{described}} as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All <b>or</b> <b>some</b> stems in a cluster may share a common root.|$|E

5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing. If a case is brought out of ill-will <b>or</b> <b>some</b> other improper purpose, the courts will be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing, even if there is a public interest in the case being heard.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal. The {{focus is on}} whether illegality <b>or</b> <b>some</b> other ground of review can be shown, rather than the applicant's relationship to the illegality complained of. If some unlawfulness can be demonstrated, the courts tend to grant a remedy even where the applicant is not directly affected by the executive decision.|$|E

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above.
