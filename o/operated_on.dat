50|$|LUCIFER uses a {{combination}} of Transposition and Substitution crypting {{as a starting point}} in decoding ciphers. One variant, described by Feistel in 1971, uses a 48-bit key and <b>operates</b> <b>on</b> 48-bit blocks. The cipher is a Substitution-permutation network and uses two 4-bit S-boxes. The key selects which S-boxes are used. The patent describes the execution of the cipher <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> 24-bits at a time, and also a sequential version <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> 8-bits at a time. Another variant by John L. Smith from the same year uses a 64-bit key <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> a 32-bit block, using one addition mod 4 and a singular 4-bit S-box. The construction is designed to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> 4 bits per clock cycle. This {{may be one of the}} smallest block-cipher implementations known. Feistel later described a stronger variant that uses a 128-bit key and <b>operates</b> <b>on</b> 128-bit blocks.|$|R
