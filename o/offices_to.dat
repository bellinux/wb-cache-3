5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> the old aristocracy, {{and at the}} same time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E

Bakshi met with Burt Hampft, a lawyer for the studio, and was hired to replace Culhane.|$|E
5|$|The {{apex of the}} Counter-Reformation {{activity}} {{had fallen}} on {{the turn of the}} 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen the power of his monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E

5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July.

5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Alberta Chief Returning Officer Lorne Gibson, {{as one of}} his 182 post-election {{recommendations}} to the government, suggested that the appointment of returning officers be handled by his own, non-partisan, office. He had previously made this suggestion in 2006, but the government had not acted on it. He also recommended following the election that his office, rather than the government's Justice department, be responsible for prosecuting election-related offenses; the latter did not lay charges in any of 19 alleged campaign finance violations Gibson brought to its attention. In February 2009, Gibson appeared before the legislature's all-party committee on legislative <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> answer questions about the conduct of the election; there, he echoed opposition claims that the government, and not his office, was to blame for most problems. Shortly after, the committee voted 8–3 against re-appointing him, with all Progressive Conservatives on the committee opposing his re-appointment and all opposition MLAs supporting it. Opposition leaders David Swann and Brian Mason suggested that Gibson was being punished for criticizing the government.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper <b>offices</b> <b>to</b> the colorful walls of the training center.
