This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all <b>other</b> <b>organs.</b> Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Twenty {{patients}} with bone metastasis following surgery for recurrent breast cancer were clinically evaluated in analysis of clinicopathologic aspect {{in comparison with}} those with metastases in <b>other</b> <b>organ.</b> It {{is more likely that}} bone metastasis occurs in younger patients as compared with <b>other</b> <b>organ</b> metastasis. However, there were no certain clinical patterns of {{patients with}} bone metastasis including the survival time, as compared with those with <b>other</b> <b>organ</b> metastasis. In this series, ER and PgR failed to measure and to elucidate the effect of hormore therapy because a subject includes parts of patients prior to development of ER and PgR measurement. In conclusion, there were no clinicopathologic features in patients with bone metastasis following surgical treatment of breast cancer except for occurrence in younger patients...|$|R

5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and <b>other</b> <b>organs</b> that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though <b>other</b> <b>organs,</b> especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. <b>Other</b> <b>organs</b> damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E

5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in <b>other</b> <b>organs,</b> or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} <b>other</b> <b>organs</b> that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E

Kościuszko's organs remain there to this day; a large memorial stone was erected in 1820, next to a Polish memorial chapel. His heart, however, was not interred with the <b>other</b> <b>organs,</b> but instead kept in an urn at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland. The heart, {{along with the rest}} of the Museum's holdings, were repatriated back to Warsaw in 1927, where the heart now reposes in a chapel at the Royal Castle.|$|E

5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to <b>other</b> <b>organs</b> and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the <b>other</b> <b>organs</b> of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and <b>other</b> <b>organs</b> of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
