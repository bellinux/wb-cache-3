5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached the majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Giants {{honored the}} {{memories}} of two <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> players on their uniforms. A helmet sticker with the number 38 {{was added to the}} uniforms after John Tuggle, a former running back the Giants selected as the final pick of the 1983 draft, died of angiosarcoma in August 1986. After former defensive back and two-time Pro Bowler Spider Lockhart died of lymphoma in July 1986, a patch with Lockhart's nickname and number were added to the jerseys and the Giants wore both the sticker and the jersey patch the whole season.|$|E

5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> Italian range.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to pull British {{resources}} from the observed build-up in the Somme, the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps and the 117th Infantry Division attacked an arc of high ground positions, defended by the Canadian Corps. The German forces initially captured the heights at Mount Sorrel and Tor Top before entrenching on the far slope of the ridge. Following a number attacks and counterattacks, two divisions of the Canadian Corps, supported by the 20th Light Division and Second Army siege and howitzer battery groups, recaptured the majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> positions.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's {{forces in}} Italy {{retained}} their formidable defensive {{positions in the}} northern Apennines in March 1945. The 6th Division rejoined the line in early April, shortly before the Allies launched their spring 1945 offensive, Operation Grapeshot. The units including Rhodesians took up positions opposite Monte Sole, Monte Abelle and Monte Caprara. The Rhodesian 25-pounder guns were posted slightly forward <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> positions, and B(Rhodesia) Squadron, Prince Alfred's Guard, moved to Grizzana. The Special Service Battalion provided armoured support to the 13th South African Motorised Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Tenaya's band {{fled the}} valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee {{returned}} to the valley, but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans {{still living in the}} Yosemite area.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E

In March 2015, bassist Gordon Moakes tweeted he had parted ways with Bloc Party. Following the departure <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> members Okereke and Lissack started to work on new songs on their own in late 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{the efforts}} of Filipino and American {{defenders}} during the Battle of Bataan were widely covered by the press, as were {{the actions of the}} 100th and 442nd Infantry. After the war, {{the efforts of}} the 442nd continued to be lauded, with the 1951 film Go for Broke! portraying their endeavors. By contrast, the activities of the Filipino Infantry Regiment and her sister units were largely unpublicized; {{it was not until the}} documentaries Unsung Heroes and An UnTold Triumph that any significant visual media covered the history of the Regiment. In 1984 an association of veterans of the Regiment erected a marker in Salinas in honor <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> unit.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{took part}} in a tournament held to {{celebrate}} Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there, otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary's regime. In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> lands, and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip's return to England. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for PhilipII at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557. Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball—according to Robert, before his own eyes. All surviving Dudley children—Ambrose and Robert with their sisters Mary and Katherine—were restored in blood by Mary I's next parliament in 1558.|$|E
5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> masters.|$|E

25|$|After another {{defeat of}} the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and {{completely}} subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control <b>of</b> all <b>their</b> <b>former</b> territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.|$|R
5|$|Soho {{is an area}} first {{developed}} in the 1670s which, since the construction of theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue in the 19th century, has had a strong association with the entertainment industry. In {{the south of the}} district stands Leicester Square, the public sculpture of which has had an eventful history. From 1748 the square had as it centrepiece an equestrian figure of George I, but this deteriorated and was sold off {{at the beginning of the}} following century. In 1874 the square was bought by Albert Grant, a company promoter and MP, who had its gardens made over to a design by James Knowles. In this refurbishment the Shakespeare fountain and busts of four historical residents of the locale were installed, the latter positioned near the sites <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> homes. A renovation of the square carried out between 2010 and 2012 was criticised for its removal of all of the sculptures on the square except for that of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore showed {{their support for}} Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region’s security and stability. That view was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge’s Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|The marriages of Ottoman sultans {{and their}} sons in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries {{tended to be}} {{with members of the}} ruling dynasties of {{neighbouring}} powers. With little regard for religion, the sultans contracted marriages with both Christians and Muslims; the purpose of these royal intermarriages were purely tactical. The Christian Byzantines and Serbians, as well as the Muslim beyliks of Germiyan, Saruhan, Karaman and Dulkadir were all potential enemies and marriage was seen as a way of securing alliances with them. Marriage with foreign dynasties seems to have ceased in 1504, with the last marriage of a sultan to a foreign princess being that of Murad II and Mara Branković, daughter of the Serbian ruler Đurađ Branković, in 1435. By this time, the Ottomans had consolidated their power in the area and absorbed or subjugated many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>former</b> rivals, and so marriage alliances were no longer seen as important to their foreign policy.|$|E
