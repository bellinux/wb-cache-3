5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers {{a large amount of}} blood in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Scully comes across rat corpses in the engine compartment of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies that anything unusual has happened in the museum.|$|E
5|$|Private {{investigator}} George Newman {{claimed in}} 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony. Commentators {{also noted that}} police and news photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> did not show Chobert's taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the trial to testify to seeing the taxi, had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared to be dead {{by the state of}} New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{that were}} {{recovered}} from the Pentagon were photographed, and {{turned over to the}} Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led the crime scene investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E

Music was provided by a peace activism group, and several photographs of this appeared in London's local press the following day.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long {{motorcade}} {{traveled to}} Brentwood and the judge, jurors, prosecutors, and defense lawyers made a two-hour inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> It {{was followed by}} a three-hour tour of O. J. Simpson's Rockingham estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear handcuffs; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his Rockingham house.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{is never}} {{in one place}} only; eventually, {{it has to be}} {{transferred}} among two or more parties, whether it be between entomologists, from the original site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to an analytical lab, or between law enforcement departments. Documentation of all these transfers have to be properly annotated on the chain-of-custody records to ensure that the “chain of evidence” is never broken. The receipts serve as verification for the whereabouts of the evidence at all times.|$|E

Given that the Spacers have already accepted that Sarton's death is unsolved, {{they are willing to}} not prosecute Enderby for the accident if he agrees to work with them to promote colonization of other worlds amongst the Medievalists.|$|E
5000|$|A DNA {{sample from}} {{a crime in}} Norway was {{subsequently}} {{found to be a}} mismatch, and there was no technical forensic evidence to link Quick to any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes.</b> Another dubious circumstance is the fact that no witnesses have ever testified to seeing Quick in <b>the</b> proximity <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes,</b> even though more than 10,000 people were interviewed for intricate details.|$|R
50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{victims were}} members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhoden family, and {{investigators}} believe the killings were premeditated and the perpetrators {{known to the}} family. On April 25, the Ohio Attorney General's office confirmed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> marijuana growth and cockfighting operations at some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes,</b> but did not confirm a direct connection to the killings. The ensuing investigation soon became the largest in Ohio's history.|$|R
30|$|Using <b>the</b> {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and {{the partial}} license plate number, the police have located a set of a dozen suspects. Of these, only four were anywhere close to <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> None <b>of</b> these four have any police records. However, <b>the</b> phone number <b>of</b> one of these persons was listed as a recent call {{on the cell phone}} left at the scene.|$|R
25|$|Inside, a key aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> {{was also}} {{inconsistent}} with the burglary theory. At {{the top of the}} stairs was a stack of stereo equipment atop a VCR. If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and her attacker had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked downstairs and scattered as well. It made more sense to assume that it had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> {{revealed that the}} body had been moved three times throughout the month it had lain undiscovered: initially, the body had lain upon a pile of bottles and cans obscured from view by elder trees, before being dragged five feet from this location into a field, where it had remained exposed {{throughout much of the}} time it had lain undiscovered. Shortly before the body was discovered, the murderer had again returned to the body and moved the body a further three feet.|$|E
25|$|At 5:15 AM on November 29, 1981, Police Officers Dennis Fitzpatrick and Ronald Zuba {{responded to}} a radio report of an {{incident}} at the Gaseteria service station in Bronx County, New York. Upon arriving at the gas station, the officers found attendant Victoriano Agostini {{lying on the floor}} of the office bleeding from the back of his head. Agostini was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. It was determined that he had sustained two bullet wounds to the head. At 8:00 AM, Detective Patrick Cirincione <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Scene</b> Unit arrived at the gas station where he photographed the scene. He recovered no firearms or spent shells.|$|E

25|$|By 2004, the {{investigation}} of the BTK Killer was cold. Then, Rader began a series of 11 communications to the local media that led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the return address Bill Thomas Killman. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and a photocopy of her driver's license, which had been stolen {{at the time of the}} crime. Before this, it was not definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK. DNA collected from under Wegerle's fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer. Altogether, over 1300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{organized}} crime–law enforcement clashes in Mexico, {{the death toll}} {{was one of the}} biggest in the presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) and in the Mexican Drug War. Because of the one-sided casualty rate, however, several media outlets have expressed doubts about the official version of the incident. The government claims that the events resulted in higher casualties from the side of the CJNG because law enforcement was better trained and equipped. However, critics believe that it may be a result of a staged incident or extrajudicial mass murder. On social media, some people uploaded several photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> that they believed showed some discrepancies. The Federal Police, however, conducted tests on the corpses and determined that all the CJNG gunmen had gunshot residue (meaning that they used their firearms to attack the officiers), and that they were killed from a distance (meaning that they were not killed execution-style). Despite the Federal Police's conclusions, the CNDH decided to open an independent investigation and did not discard the possibility of a mass murder case.|$|E
25|$|The police {{made several}} {{mistakes}} in {{the handling of the}} case, especially in overlooking the remains of Christie's previous murder victims left in the garden at Rillington Place; one femur was later found propping up a fence. The garden of the property was very small, about , and the fence was parallel to the wash-house where the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine were later found. Several searches were made at the house after Evans confessed to placing his wife's remains in the drains, but the wash-house was not entered at any point by the three policemen conducting the search. The garden was apparently examined but was not excavated at this point. Christie later admitted that his dog had unearthed the skull of Muriel Eady in the garden shortly after these police searches, which he simply threw into an abandoned bombed-out house in nearby St. Marks Road. There was clearly no systematic search made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> in which this or other human remains would have been found, and pointed to Christie as the perpetrator. Several police searches of the property showed a complete lack of expertise in handling forensic evidence and were quite superficial, at best. Had the searches been conducted effectively, the investigation would have exposed Christie as a murderer, and the lives of four women, as well as Evans', would have been saved.|$|E

500|$|The Ace Attorney Investigations {{spin-off}} series {{splits the}} gameplay into investigation phases and rebuttal phases, {{the latter of}} {{which is similar to}} the courtroom trials of the main series. During the investigation phases, the player searches for evidence and talks to witnesses and suspects.
