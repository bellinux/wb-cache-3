25|$|The Second Sickness Insurance Modification Law {{linked the}} {{indexation}} of the income-limit for compulsory employee coverage {{to the development}} of the pension insurance contribution ceiling (75% of the ceiling), obliged employers to pay half of the contributions in the case of voluntary membership, extended the criteria for voluntary membership of employees, and introduced preventive medical check-ups for certain groups. The Law on Sickness Insurance for Farmers (1972) included the self-employed, their dependants and people who receive old age assistance in sickness insurance. The Law on the Social Insurance of Disabled Persons (1975) included in sickness and pension insurance disabled persons employed in workshops and institutions under certain conditions, while a law was passed in June that year to include all students in statutory sickness insurance. Social protection against the risks of an <b>occupational</b> <b>accident,</b> death, disability, and old age was newly regulated in 1974 through a Civil Servant Provisioning Law that was standard throughout the country.|$|E

Results showed that psychosocial factors were associated with <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> in both sectors.

The current article examines the actual predictors of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> in the Netherlands using a prospective research design, and compares these predictors with the determinants of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> from a cross-sectional research design. To this end, longitudinal data from 9, 889 employees who participated the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study were analyzed. The results show that the differences in the determinants of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> in the past (retrospective) and the future (prospective) are limited. The factors that predict accidents are often similar to the factors associated with accidents that workers in the past have had. There are some factors that are an exception and are retrospectively, but not prospectively associated with the occurrence of an accident. Possibly, these are examples of reversed causality.

The control group comprised 1380 male workers who had not been exposed to the same working demands and professional noxae in the given period of time. In the period of ten years the number of workers having <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> was statistically significantly higher in the exposed group than in the control one.

40|$|Background and Objectives : Overhaul {{program is}} one of the sensitive, {{dangerous}} and extensive activities in petroleum industries. As a result of high rate of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> throughout this program, it is necessary to study the cause of accidents carefully. The current study as a descriptive-analytical was designed and conducted to evaluate the rate and cause of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> that were occurred throughout the overhaul program within ten years (2001 - 2010) in one of the petroleum industries Material and Methods : The <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> data including demographic parameters (age, marital status), job experience, year of accident, affected organ, type and nature of injury and cause of accident were collected from workers’ medical records. The collected data were then analyzed by SPSS- 11 and descriptive statistics. Results : According to the results, about 23 <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> were occurred in the-refinery during the last 10 years throughout the overhaul program. The majority of accidents (43. 5 %) was occurred in 2006, while the lowest was (4. 3 %) in 2002. The mean age of injured subjects was 30. 2 ± 11. 2 years. Most injured subjects (56. 5 %) were observed in age category of 21 - 30 years and less (13 %) in age category of 31 - 40 and over 50 years old. The most injured organs were lower parts of body (52. 2 %) and upper parts of body (47. 8 %) respectively. Main causes of accidents were reported as unsafe acts (careless, unsafe and lack of skill), while environmental conditions (slipperiness) caused a lowest number of accidents. Conclusion : In this study, unsafe acts were the most important factors of the <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents.</b> In order to reduce the <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> throughout the program, job safety courses and trainings are essential to be held for workers. Moreover, applying comments of HSE staffs, precise supervision on accomplishment of the regulations, providing and using the proper personal protective equipment are helpful to prevent the <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents...</b>|$|R
