5|$|Genomic DNA is {{tightly and}} orderly packed {{in the process}} called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA {{is located in the}} cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop {{so that the}} regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 40 % of {{mammalian}} mRNA sequences contain AUG trinucleotides upstream of {{the main}} coding sequence, with a quarter of these AUGs demarcating <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> of 20 or more codons. In order to investigate whether these <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> may encode functional peptides, we have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of human and mouse mRNA 'untranslated regions' using sequences from the RefSeq mRNA sequence database. Results We have identified over 200 upstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> which are strongly conserved between the human and mouse genomes. Consensus sequences associated with efficient initiation of translation are overrepresented at the AUG trinucleotides of these upstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> while comparative analysis of their DNA and putative peptide sequences shows evidence of purifying selection. Conclusion The occurrence {{of a large number}} of conserved upstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> in association with features consistent with protein translation, strongly suggests evolutionary maintenance of the coding sequence and indicates probable functional expression of the peptides encoded within these upstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of the HindlI I T fragment of human cytomegalovirus strain AD 169 has been deter-mined. This 6225 bp sequence has been analysed for transcription signals and probable <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Similarities with herpes simplex virus, vari-cella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus genes were observed for three of the predicted <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> frames; avirion protein and a unique DNA helicase {{are believed to be}} the functional products of two of these <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Two other <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> are novel in that no homologues could be found, either in the known herpesvirus sequences or in the Protein Identification Resource database. Both of these <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> also lie in the genomic coding region of a 5 - 0 kb RNA which is transcribed throughout the infectious cycle...|$|R
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the translation of the toxin is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E
5|$|The S segment {{consists}} of 1953bases, of which 1287 (starting at position 43) code for the nucleocapsid protein. In addition, a second 192-base <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> {{occurs in the}} middle of this sequence (starting at position 122), as in several other hantaviruses. Among three specimens of O.couesi, the sequence in this segment differed by only 1%, and all changes were silent mutations. The amino acids of the S segment differ by 7 to 10% from those of the related hantaviruses Bayou virus (BAYV; from the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris), Catacamas virus (CATV; from a Honduras population of Oryzomys couesi), and Black Creek Canal virus (BCCV; from the hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus). The nucleotide sequence differs by 24% from those viruses.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{papillomavirus}} types encode a short protein {{from the}} E8 gene. In {{the case of}} BPV-4 (papillomavirus genus Xi), the E8 <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> may substitute for the E6 <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame,</b> which is absent in this papillomavirus genus. These E8 genes are chemically and functionally similar to the E5 genes from some human papillomaviruses, and are also called E5/E8.|$|E
40|$|Some {{statistical}} {{properties of}} <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> in all currently available complete genome sequences are analyzed (seventeen prokatyotic genomes, and 16 chromosome sequences from the yeast genome). The size distribution of <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{is characterized by}} various techniques, such as quantile tables, QQ-plots, rank-size plots (Zipf's plots), and spatial densities. The issue {{of the influence of}} CG% on the size distribution is addressed. When yeast chromosomes are compared with archaeal and eubacterial genomes, they tend to have more long <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> There is little or no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> on six different <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> and two strands distribute similarly. A topic of current interest, the base composition asymmetry in <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> between the two strands, is studied using regression analysis. The base composition asymmetry at three codon positions is analyzed separately. It was shown in these genome sequences that the first codon position is G- and A-rich (i. e. purine-rich); there is a co-existence of A- and T-rich branches at the second codon position; and the third codon position is weakly T-rich...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the sacU {{region have}} a {{pleiotropic}} phenotype. Certain mutations designated sacU(Hy), for example, express degradative enzymes at high levels, {{are able to}} sporulate {{in the presence of}} glucose, have severely reduced transformation efficiencies, and are nonmotile. We isolated and sequenced the sacU gene region of Bacillus subtilis. Two <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> were found in the sacU region, and sacU(Hy) mutations were localized to both of these <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> The two <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> have similarities to two widespread families of proteins that mediate responses to environmental stimuli...|$|R
25|$|Genes {{within the}} {{papillomavirus}} genome are usually identified after similarity with other previously identified genes. However, some spurious <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{might have been}} mistaken as genes simply after {{their position in the}} genome, and might not be true genes. This applies specially to certain E3, E4, E5 and E8 <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus has}} a {{positive}} sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> that is 9600 nucleotide bases long. This single <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatic Institute, the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.|$|E

25|$|Several highly sensitive, confirmatory {{real-time}} RT-PCR assays {{exist for}} rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene), <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> 1B (targets the ORF1b gene) and <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> 1A (targets the ORF1a gene). The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays {{as it is}} highly sensitive. In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all coronaviruses) and nucleocapsid (N) gene (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.|$|E

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} and translation procedure was designed to translate multiple <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> from cloned DNAs. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cloned DNA carrying three <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (sor, tat, and 3 '-orf), the approach yielded three authentic polypeptides. Clearly, the internal initiation codons {{can be used for}} reinitiation of translation of the downstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> However, the downstream <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> were translated with relatively lower translational efficiencies. In general, the translational efficiency of RNAs depended significantly on their structures. The in vitro approach was utilized further to map the immunoreactive domains of the 3 '-orf and sor gene products of HIV. Deletion clones were constructed with deletions within the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> Translation products of these clones reacted differentially with anti- 3 '-orf and anti-sor rabbit immune sera and human sera from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders. Apparently, recombinant 3 '-orf and sor polypeptides used to immunize rabbits express many more immunogenic epitopes and/or different set of epitopes than is the case for the native proteins in humans infected with HIV. Immunoreactivity and immunogenicity of these gene products were significantly dependent on their structure and/or conformation...|$|R

40|$|We have {{analysed}} short <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (between 150 and 300 base pairs long) of {{the yeast}} genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with a two-step strategy.

The second step filters the candidate set by selecting <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> with high similarity to other known sequences (from any organism).

25|$|The MIR155HG RNA {{transcript}} {{does not}} contain a long <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (ORF), however, it does include an imperfectly base-paired stem loop that is conserved across species. This non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is now defined as a primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA). Once miR-155 pri-miRNA is transcribed, this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, of which the core components are the RNase III type endonuclease Drosha and the DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8) protein, to produce a 65 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-mir-155) (see Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|Human NAA15 {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 4q31.1 and contains 23 exons.

According to RefSeq/NCBI, only one human transcript variant exists, although 2 more isoforms are predicted. In addition to full length Naa15, an N-terminally truncated variant of Naa15 (named tubedown-1), Naa15273-865 has been described; however, in mouse only full length Naa15 is widely expressed, whereas smaller transcripts seem to visualized only in heart and testis.|$|E
25|$|All ciliates {{have two}} nuclei, but they {{differ in their}} {{structure}} of the somatic nucleus. All ciliates except Karyorelictea have a dividing macronucleus. C. uncinata also has a dividing macronucleus, but it modifies its macronuclear genome from the maternal micronuclear genome by producing macronuclear chromosomes that contain one or two <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (ORFs). The average size of these macronuclear chromosomes is 4 kbit/s. The macronuclear chromosomes are also amplified to produce a high variable copy number between the chromosomes. For example, chromosome A may have 500 copies while chromosome B only has 5 copies in the macronucleus. This leaves the macronuclear genome with millions of individual chromosomes, all containing telomere ends, only one ORF, and little area for transcription factor binding for initiation of transcription.|$|E

25|$|CCR5 {{is one of}} {{the cell}} entry co-factors {{associated}} with HIV, most frequently involved with nonsyncytium-inducing strains, is most apparent in HIV patients as opposed to AIDS patients. A 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 has been identified as a mutation that negates the likelihood of an HIV infection. This region on the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> ORF contains a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. This leads to the loss of the HIV-coreceptor function in vitro. CCR5-1 is considered the wild type and CCR5-2 is considered to be the mutant allele. Those with a heterozygous mutation for the CCR5 were less susceptible to the development of HIV. In a study, despite high exposure to the HIV virus, there was no one homozygous for the CCR5 mutation that tested positive for HIV.|$|E
25|$|Aceruloplasminemia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} (a five-base pair insertion in exon 7) in the CP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin, a protein involved in iron transport and processing. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body and prepares it for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports it to red blood cells to help carry oxygen. The CP gene mutation results in the production of ceruloplasmin protein that is unstable or nonfunctional by altering the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> such that the amino acid ligands in the essential carboxyl terminal region are eliminated. When ceruloplasmin is unavailable, transport of iron out of the body's tissues is impaired. The resulting iron accumulation damages cells in those tissues, leading to neurological dysfunction and other health problems.|$|E

The CCDC130 protein is rich in charged amino acids and deficient in uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Mobyle @ Pasteur predicted CCDC130 to be extremely hydrophilic due to {{the large numbers of}} charged and polar amino acids, with no site scoring above zero on the hydrophobicity graph and some sites reaching as low as -6 (F180). There is a region in the coiled coil domain (182-214) in which 14 of 18 amino acids are charged. SAPS analysis predicted that this protein would be unstable. Due to its high hydrophilicity, this protein definitely does not contain transmembrane segments.|$|E
