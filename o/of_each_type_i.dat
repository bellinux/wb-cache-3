40|$|When {{designing}} a Cellular Manufacturing System an essential {{step is to}} solve the cell formation problem: determining which machines and parts belong to each cell. The main purpose is to obtain autonomous cells capable of completely processing the respective family of parts and thus eliminate, or at least reduce, intercellular flow. Additionally, if {{there is more than}} one machine <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> (<b>i.</b> e. if a certain operation can be performed in different machines) the assignment of operations to specific machines becomes part of the cell formation problem. In this paper an algorithm for the cell formation problem with multiple identical machines, which minimises the intercellular flow, is presented. The algorithm uses the information provided by an inter-operation flow matrix so the real flow, associated with each solution, can be adequately determined. Furthermore, due to the combinatorial nature of this problem, the procedure is based on genetic algorithms in order to improve the exploration of the solution space...|$|E

40|$|Antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) {{have been}} {{discovered}} in fish. Genomic studies revealed their considerable number in many species; some genes encode secreted and non-secreted isoforms. Based on cysteine motifs, fish type I IFNs fall in two subgroups, which use two different receptors. Mammalian type I IFN genes are intronless while type III have introns; in fish, all have introns, but structurally, both subgroups belong to type I. Type I IFNs likely appeared early in vertebrates as intron containing genes, and evolved in parallel in tetrapods and fishes. The diversity of their repertoires in fish and mammals is likely a convergent feature, selected {{as a response to}} the variety of viral strategies. Several alternative nomenclatures have been established for different taxonomic fish groups, calling for a unified system.

40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{and describes}} a typology of policy instruments {{that has a}} dual purpose. It serves (1) as a conceptual tool for integrating {{the findings of the}} different studies that were part of our inter- and transdisciplinary research and (2) as a useful frame of reference for political actors when choosing appropriate sets of instruments for policy strategies. The instruments we have included in the typology focus on the ecological dimension of sustainability; they are applied primarily to promote environmentally responsible action. However, we believe that the five basic types of instruments – command and control instruments, economic instruments, ervice and infrastructure instruments, collaborative agreements, and communication and diffusion instru-ments – are of a general character that would allow for the inclusion of specific groups of in-struments for promoting economic and social sustainability. Future work will tackle the issue of complementing the typology so that it covers the full range of instruments available for promoting all three dimensions of sustainable development. The chapter consists of five sections. After a brief introduction, we present an overview of the typology by characterising the five types of instruments and relating them to each other (section 2, including the trilingual survey Tables 1 A-C on pages 40 - 45).

Cyclic bending stresses have been implicated in the calcification, disruption and tearing of the valve leaflets, yet calculations of flexural stresses are not possible because leaflet mechanics are not fully understood. Although tensile testing has quantified many of the elastic properties of the material, it has offered little insight into the mechanism of xenograft failure that may result from systolic leaflet bending.;This thesis therefore reports my examination of the bending mechanics of xenografts in comparison with the fresh tissue from natural pig aortic valves.;From 15 histologically-prepared thin sections <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type,</b> <b>I</b> found that glutaraldehyde-treated tissue was much more susceptible to compressive buckling and delamination than fresh tissue (p dollar 3 ̆cdollar 0. 005), especially when the natural curvature of the leaflet was reversed.

40|$|Capsulated transformants {{producing}} type II polysaccharide {{have been}} obtained by reactions between a number of R mutants of type II pneumococcus. All the IIR strains except II-R 36 yielded extracts which transformed 2 VIIIR strains to VIIIS. Two of the IIR strains were transformed to VIIIS by an extract of 1 VIIIR strain. The most striking result was the production of both IIS and VIIIS transformants {{by the action of}} extracts of both VIIIR strains applied to cells of II-RB. This suggests that the determination of capsular type in pneumococcus does not depend on single allelomorphic genes; it seems more likely that a number of genes may be required to determine type specificity, and that some genes may be common to different types, possibly in connection with common biochemical pathways for some stages of polysaccharide synthesis. This is further indicated by the finding that extracts of capsulated strains <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> II, III, VII, VIII, XIV, and XVIII are capable of giving IIS transformants with 1 or more of the IIR strains in addition to the expected donor-type transformants.

This may be the case also with IIIS strains since only IIIS transformants were found when IIIS extract was applied to any of the IIR strains...|$|R

Six of the seven enzymes show a significant {{genetic component}} {{in at least one}} set of lines, and five of the seven enzymes show activity variations attributable to factors that are not linked to the structural gene. These unlinked activity modifiers identify possible regulatory elements. Analyses of covariance show that most of the genetic variation of enzyme activities cannot be accounted for by genetic variation of live weight or protein content. These results and the lack of strong correlations between the genetic effects on the activities of different enzymes indicate that the effects are mainly specific for individual enzymes...|$|R

In this article, we describe several methods of combining data that may be used for testing hypotheses of the treatment effect. Furthermore, illustrations <b>of</b> <b>each</b> test's <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> error and power under different missing data percentages and mechanisms are quantified using a Monte-Carlo simulation study.

Some people preach with great fervour sermons that are little more than reflections of their personality — emphasizing the positive or the negative in the text and in the congregation. These sermons have less to do with “speaking the words of God ” than reflecting the personality of the preacher.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Generalized Bin Covering (GBC) problem: We are given m bin types, where each bin of type i has profit p_i and demand d_i. Furthermore, there are n items, where item j has size s_j. A bin of type i is covered if {{the set of}} items assigned to it has total size at least the demand d_i. In that case, the profit of p_i is earned and {{the objective is to}} maximize the total profit. To {{the best of our knowledge}}, only the cases p_i = d_i = 1 (Bin Covering) and p_i = d_i (Variable-Sized Bin Covering (VSBC)) have been treated before. We study two models of bin supply: In the unit supply model, we have exactly one bin <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type,</b> <b>i.</b> e., we have individual bins. By contrast, in the infinite supply model, we have arbitrarily many bins of each type. Clearly, the unit supply model is a generalization of the infinite supply model. To the best of our knowledge the unit supply model has not been studied yet. Our results for the unit supply model hold not only asymptotically, but for all instances. This contrasts most of the previous work on Bin Covering. We prove that there is a combinatorial 5 -approximation algorithm for GBC with unit supply, which has running time nm√(m+n). Furthermore, for VSBC we show that the natural and fast Next Fit Decreasing () algorithm is a 9 / 4 -approximation in the unit supply model. The bound is tight for the algorithm and close to being best-possible. We show that there is an AFPTAS for VSBC in the infinite supply model.

40|$|Newly {{developed}} {{concepts and}} methods for the quantification of fibre type regionalisation {{were used for}} comparison between all muscles traversing the ankle of the rat lower hindlimb (n = 12). For each muscle, cross-sections from the proximodistal midlevel were stained for myofibrillar ATPase and classified as type I (‘slow’) or II (‘fast’). For the 11 ‘fast’ muscles (i. e. all except soleus), the muscle outline and the position <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> fibre were digitised for further computer processing. Two potentially independent aspects of type I fibre regionalisation were evaluated quantitatively: (1) {{the degree to which}} type I fibres were restricted to a limited portion of the total cross-sectional area (‘area-regionalisation’); (2) the extent and direction of the difference (if any) between the centre of the muscle cross-section and the calculated centre for the type I fibre cluster (‘vector regionalisation’). Statistical analysis showed that type I fibres were vector regionalised in practically all investigated muscles and area regionalised within most of them, the only consistent exceptions being peroneus brevis and peroneus digitorum 4, 5. In muscles {{with a high degree of}} area regionalisation the population of type I fibres also had a markedly eccentric intramuscular position (i. e. high vector regionalisation). A significant relationship was observed between the relative position of a muscle within the hindlimb (transverse plane) and the direction and degree of its type I fibre eccentricity. On average, the degree of type I fibre eccentricity was greater for muscles remote from the limb centre than for those situated more centrally. In addition, the intramuscular concentration of type I fibres was typically greatest towards the centre of the limb, the most striking exception being tibialis posterior. For the slow soleus muscle, which is centrally placed within the limb, our analysis concerned the type II fibres, which were found to be weakly vector regionalised but not significantly area regionalised. It is concluded that, within muscles of the rat's lower hindlimb, fibre type regionalisation is a general and graded phenomenon which may reflect differentiating (embryological?) mechanisms of a transmuscular significance. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated the usefulness of our new methods and concepts for the quantification of fibre type regionalisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{re-analysis}} of the criteria used to characterize the Peimbert classes I, IIa, IIb, III and IV, through a statistical study of a large sample of planetary nebulae previously classified according to these groups. In the original classification, it is usual to find planetary nebulae that cannot {{be associated with a}} single type; these most likely have dubious classifications into two or three types. Statistical methods can greatly contribute in providing a better characterization of planetary nebulae groups. We use the Bayes Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for an object to be member <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> IIa, IIb, III and IV. This calculation is particularly important for planetary nebulae that are ambiguously classified in the traditional method. The posterior probabilities are defined from the probability density function of classificatory parameters of a well-defined sample, composed only by planetary nebulae unambiguously fitted into the Peimbert types. Because the probabilities depend on the available observational data, they are conditional probabilities, and, as new observational data are added to the sample, the classification of the nebula can be improved, to take into account this new information. This method differs from the original classificatory scheme, because it provides a quantitative result of the representativity of the object within its group. Also, through the use of marginal distributions it is possible to extend the Peimbert classification even to those objects for which only a few classificatory parameters are known.

40|$|In 0. 5 {{per cent}} NaCl, {{nutrient}} broth at 35 °C., urethane in {{a concentration of}} 0. 4 M stops the reproduction of Escherichia coli, strain B. On dilution with 20 volumes of sterile medium, growth is resumed at its former rate after a short lag. In the one-step growth of T 2, 15, T 6, or T 7, in the same medium at the same temperature, 0. 4 M urethane, when added {{at the time of}} infection, had no apparent effect on adsorption and caused no decrease in titer throughout the latent period of the control, but completely prevented a rise in titer. If diluted 1 : 20 with sterile medium prior to a certain critical time in the latent period, however, bacteriophage was liberated at the same time, and in the same amount as in the control. The initial stage of apparent insensitivity to the drug lasts from the time of infection until the approximate critical times of 7 minutes with T 7, T 2, or T 6, or 13 minutes with T 5. Under the conditions described, the normal latent periods were 14, 23, 30, and 44 minutes for T 7, T 2, T 6, and T 5, respectively. At the critical times referred to above, there begins a stage characterized by complete sensitivity, rather than complete insensitivity, to 0. 4 M urethane, in the sense that no active phage is subsequently liberated in continued presence of the drug. The length of this completely sensitive stage, as judged by addition of the drug at successive intervals during the latent period, extends from approximately 7 until 9 minutes after infection with T 7, 7 until 15 minutes with T 2 or T 6, or 13 until 25 minutes with T 5. When the urethane is added late in this stage of T 2, a decrease in initial titer takes place as judged by assays made 40 minutes after infection, the maximum effect occurring when the drug is added between 14 and 15 minutes after infection. When added subsequently to the completely sensitive stage <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type,</b> <b>i.</b> e. subsequently to 9 minutes after infection with T 7, 15 minutes with T 2 or T 6, or 25 minutes with T 5, liberation of the bacteriophage takes place in presence of the drug, but the yield is reduced, the amount of reduction being greater the sooner it is added. The yield increases as addition of the drug is delayed, but it is measurably reduced when added late in the rise period. Macroscopic lysis with T 7 is delayed by 0. 4 M urethane, when present from the time of infection. The delay is less with increased multiplicities of infection. A similar delay occurs with T 6 r at a multiplicity of 4. The application of hydrostatic pressures of 7, 000 to 9, 000 p. s. i. early in the latent period, within 5 to 8 minutes after infection, prevents a yield {{in each of the four}} phage types, and if maintained for lengthy periods of time a reduction in initial titer occurs. If released at various times shortly after the latent period, a rise in the titer occurred after a certain interval whose length was characteristic of the phage type. The yield was less the longer the release of pressure was delayed. When the pressure was first applied late in the latent period, large amounts of phage were liberated either under pressure or explosively when pressure was released to make the assays. Hydrostatic pressure at 6, 000 p. s. i. had little effect on the rate or amount of macroscopic clearing with T 7 in relatively high multiplicity of infection, when applied at the start of lysis, but slowed the rate and reduced the amount of clearing when applied shortly after infection...|$|E

Research on motor learning suggests that augmented feedback may provide a beneficial effect for training movement. This study {{examined the effects of}} the presence and frequency of online augmented visual kinematic feedback (AVKF) and clinician-provided perceptual feedback on speech accuracy in 2 adults with acquired AOS. Within a single-subject multiple-baseline design, AVKF was provided using electromagnetic midsagittal articulography (EMA) in 2 feedback conditions (50 or 100 %). Articulator placement was specified for speech motor targets (SMTs). Treated and baselined SMTs were in the initial or final position of single-syllable words, in varying consonant-vowel or vowel-consonant contexts. SMTs were selected based on each participant's pre-assessed erred productions. Productions were digitally recorded and online perceptual judgments of accuracy (including segment and intersegment distortions) were made. Inter- and intra-judge reliability for perceptual accuracy was high. Results measured by visual inspection and effect size revealed positive acquisition and generalization effects for both participants. Generalization occurred across vowel contexts and to untreated probes. Results of the frequency manipulation were confounded by presentation order. Maintenance of learned and generalized effects were demonstrated for 1 participant. These data provide support for the role of augmented feedback in treating speech movements that result in perceptually accurate speech production.

25|$|After formation, a hypercycle reaches {{either an}} {{internal}} equilibrium or {{a state with}} oscillating concentrations <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> chain <b>I,</b> but with the total concentration of all chains remaining constant. In this way, the system consisting of all chains can be expressed as a single, integrated entity. During the formation of hypercycles, several {{of them could be}} present in comparable concentrations, but very soon, a selection of the hypercycle with the highest fitness value will take place. Here, the fitness value expresses the adaptation of the hypercycle to the environment, and the selection based on it is very sharp. After one hypercycle wins the competition, it is very unlikely that another one could take its place, even if the new hypercycle would be more efficient than the winner. Usually, even large fluctuations in the numbers of internal species cannot weaken the hypercycle enough to destroy it. In the case of a hypercycle, we can speak of one-for-ever selection, which is responsible for the existence of a unique translation code and a particular chirality.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} design and {{implementation}} of a new technique, called the Layered Hybrid ARQ/FEC, for increasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of MPEG video bitstreams while they are transmitted over networks and enduring data loss. This new technique, which is the major focus of this thesis, {{can be achieved by}} first combining the two error control methods: Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) with RS-FEC (the Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction method), and second by defining different layers <b>of</b> protection for <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> frame in the MPEG video stream. This thesis starts by explaining the structure of MPEG video bitstreams and the different levels <b>of</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> frame (<b>I,</b> P, or B frames). Also, the thesis explains in details some ARQ and FEC techniques, focusing on Reed-Solomon mechanism. The thesis then introduces the Layered Hybrid ARQ/FEC technique being applied on MPEG video; the method is first theoretically detailed and then implemented as a server/client application-layer software using C language. Data are collected, and analysed, and compared with other methods. Finally, conclusions are derived and suggestions for future improvements are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|In {{order for}} an organ {{to develop and}} function, {{different}} cell types and tissues must be specified and integrated in a tightly controlled manner. An {{example of this is}} the C. elegans hermaphrodite egg-laying system, which requires coordination between the vulva, uterus, neurons, and musculature. The specification of the first three components are well understood from a genetic standpoint, however, very {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms responsible for the specification of the egg-laying musculature. The egg-laying muscles are non-striated in nature and consist of sixteen cells, four <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II vulval muscles and uterine muscles. These sixteen non-striated muscles possess unique morphology, location, synaptic connectivity and function. Through the use of an RNAi screen targeting the putative transcription factors in the C. elegans genome, I identified a number of novel factors important for the diversification of these distinct types of egg-laying muscles. In particular, I discovered that RNAi knockdown of lag- 1, which encodes the sole C. elegans ortholog of the transcription factor CSL (CBF 1, Suppressor of Hairless, LAG- 1), an effector of the LIN- 12 /Notch pathway, led to the production of extra <b>type</b> <b>I</b> vulval muscles. Similar phenotypes wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) {{with or without}} {{exercise}} (ladder climbing) in countering the effects of unweighting on fast muscles of hypophysectomized rats during 10 days of hindlimb suspension were determined. Compared with untreated suspended rats, muscle weights were 16 - 29 % larger in GH-treated and 5 - 15 % larger in IGF-I-treated suspended rats. Exercise alone {{had no effect on}} muscle weights. Compared with ambulatory control, the medial gastrocnemius weight in suspended, exercised rats was larger after GH treatment and maintained with IGF-I treatment. The combination of GH or IGF-I plus exercise in suspended rats resulted in an increase in size <b>of</b> <b>each</b> predominant fiber <b>type,</b> <b>i.</b> e., <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> I + IIa and IIa + IIx, in the medial gastrocnemius compared with untreated suspended rats. Normal ambulation or exercise during suspension increased the proportion of fibers expressing embryonic myosin heavy chain in hypophysectomized rats. The phenotype of the medial gastrocnemius was minimally affected by GH, IGF-I, and/or exercise. These results show that there is an IGF-I, as well as a GH, and exercise interactive effect in maintaining medial gastrocnemius fiber size in suspended hypophysectomized rats...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the authors keep on {{developing}} the approach to a problem of the determination of sound sources and their localization in a turbulent jet. This approach was proposed in [1 - 2] and {{was based on the}} azimuthal decomposition of the far sound field via one 6 -microphones array around jet, moving step by step along the jet axis. The directivities of the azimuthal component radiation in the frequency band 600 - 1350 Hz is investigated by making use of this system. The method of sound source localization developed in [1 - 2] was based on the minimization of the directivity functional in the space of the functions corresponding to the noise directivities of vortex rings and moving quadruples acting in the equivalent point source locations and lip noise dipoles respectively. Following this approach we take into account the effect of the noise refraction to meet better the experimental data for small downstream angle to the jet axis. It gives the new model curves, determining the new locations of the radiating vortex rings and the small-scaled turbulence in frequency bands. The fact of better agreement in turn guarantees better reliability of the source localization and the values of relative input <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> source. <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|Binocular rivalry {{can occur}} when {{incompatible}} stimuli are presented separately to the eyes. Since {{the invention of}} the stereoscope by Wheatstone in 1838, binocular rivalry has been intensively investigated with visual stimuli, which are differentiated from the background by variations in luminance, so-called luminance-modulated stimuli. However, it is also possible to perceive stimuli for which luminance of the target does not differ from that of the background but instead varies in contrast: so-called contrast-modulated (CM) stimuli. The main aim of this thesis is to investigate CM and noisy luminance-modulated (LM) stimuli under binocular rivalry conditions as the gained knowledge would enhance our understanding of both CM processing, as well as binocular rivalry. Perceptual change rates, proportions of exclusive visibility, mixed percepts (i. e. piecemeal and superimposition), as well as changes of these proportions across time and distributions of perceptual phases were calculated and compared between various CM and LM stimulus conditions. To compare those stimulus <b>types</b> with <b>each</b> other, the detection threshold was measured in one experiment to determine the visibility <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stimulus <b>type,</b> <b>i.</b> e. multiples above threshold. LM stimuli engage in significantly more exclusive visibility and trigger more alternation even when CM stimuli are of comparable visibility. Lower proportions of exclusive visibility and numbers of perceptual alternation for CM stimuli were due to greater proportions of superimposition. When comparably visible LM and CM stimuli compete with each other under binocular rivalry conditions, CM exclusive visibility predominates over LM exclusive visibility. Even if LM visibility is many times above CM visibility, LM stimuli never reach perceptual predominance. This result suggests that CM stimuli are processed unlike LM stimuli by neurones that receive initial binocular input. The results obtained were integrated into models concerning alternation dynamics and underlying processing sites for LM and CM stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Cytokeratins are {{expressed}} in different types of epithelial cells in certain combinations of polypeptides of the acidic (<b>type</b> <b>I)</b> and basic (<b>type</b> II) subfamilies, showing "expression pairs. " We have examined in vitro the ability of purified and denatured cytokeratin polypeptides of human, bovine, and rat origin to form the characteristic heterotypic subunit complexes, as determined by various electrophoretic techniques and chemical cross-linking, and, subsequently, intermediate-sized filaments (IFs), as shown by electron microscopy. We have found {{that all of the}} diverse <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cytokeratin polypeptides examined can form complexes and IFs when allowed to react with equimolar amounts of any of the type II polypeptides. Examples of successful subunit complex and IF formation in vitro include combinations of polypeptides that have never been found to occur in the same cell type in vivo, such as between epidermal cytokeratins and those from simple epithelia, and also heterologous combinations between cytokeratins from different species. The reconstituted complexes and IFs show stability properties, as determined by gradual "melting" and reassociation, that {{are similar to those of}} comparable native combinations or characteristic for the specific new pair combination. The results show that cytokeratin complex and IF formation in vitro requires the pairing of one representative <b>of</b> <b>each</b> the <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II subfamilies into the heterotypic tetramer but that there is no structural incompatibility between any of the members of the two subfamilies. These findings suggest that the co-expression of specific pair combinations observed in vivo has other reasons than general structural requirements for IF formation and probably rather reflects the selection of certain regulatory programs of expression during cell differentiation. Moreover, the fact that certain cytokeratin polypeptide pairs that readily form complexes in vitro and coexist in the same cells in vivo nevertheless show preferential, if not exclusive, partner relationships in the living cell points to the importance of differences of stabilities among cytokeratin complexes and/or the existence of extracytokeratinous factors involved in the specific formation of certain cytokeratin pairs...|$|R
40|$|Opaque or nonvitreous phenotypes {{relate to}} the seed {{architecture}} of maize (Zea mays) and are linked to loci that control the accumulation and proper deposition of storage proteins, called zeins, into specialized organelles in the endosperm, called protein bodies. However, {{in the absence of}} null mutants <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> zein (<b>i.</b> e. α, β, γ, and δ), the molecular contribution of these proteins to seed architecture remains unclear. Here, a double null mutant for the δ-zeins, the 22 -kD α-zein, the β-zein, and the γ-zein RNA interference (RNAi; designated as z 1 CRNAi, βRNAi, and γRNAi, respectively) and their combinations have been examined. While the δ-zein double null mutant had negligible effects on protein body formation, the βRNAi and γRNAi alone only cause slight changes. Substantial loss of the 22 -kD α-zeins by z 1 CRNAi resulted in protein body budding structures, indicating that a sufficient amount of the 22 -kD zeins is necessary for maintenance of a normal protein body shape. Among different mutant combinations, only the combined βRNAi and γRNAi resulted in drastic morphological changes, while other combinations did not. Overexpression of α-kafirins, the homologues of the maize 22 -kD α-zeins in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), in the β/γRNAi mutant failed to offset the morphological alterations, indicating that β- and γ-zeins have redundant and unique functions in the stabilization of protein bodies. Indeed, opacity of the β/γRNAi mutant was caused by incomplete embedding of the starch granules rather than by reducing the vitreous zone...|$|R
