50|$|The {{shape of}} the semiintegral {{can be used as}} an easy method to measure the amount of <b>ohmic</b> <b>drop</b> of an {{electrochemical}} cell in cyclic voltammetry. Essentially the semiintegral of a cyclic voltammogram at a planar electrode (an electrode that obeys to the rules of planar diffusion) has the shape of a sigmoid while the original data is gauss-sigmoid convoluted. This enables the operator to optimize parameters necessary for positive feedback compensation in an easy manor. If <b>ohmic</b> <b>drop</b> distortion is present the two sigmoids for the forward and the backward scan are far away from congruence, the <b>ohmic</b> <b>drop</b> can be calculated from the deviation from congruence in these cases.

The FWHM of the curve is approximately 100 mV for a system that behaves in the described manor. The maximum is found at the value of the formal potential, this is quivalent to the 1.5th order semiderivative hitting the abszissa at this potential. Moreover the semiderivative scales linearly with the scanrate, while the current scales linearly with the square root of the scanrate (Randles-Sevcik equation). Plotting the semiderivatives produced at different scanrates gives a family of curves that are linearly related by the scanrate quotient in an ideal system.|$|E

Current distribution is more uniform at lower C rates and lower temperatures.

The particular case of voltammetry of a self-assembled monolayer carrying one redox site per molecule is investigated here. In addition, the effect of an uneven distribution of the effective electrochemical potential on the possibility of electron hopping (EH) contributions is examined.
