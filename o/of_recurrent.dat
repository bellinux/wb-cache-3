Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin.

5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature is a history <b>of</b> <b>recurrent,</b> self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrent</b> biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E

5|$|Treatment was {{initially}} limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrent</b> HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.|$|E
5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrent</b> VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in}} the length of treatment.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem for {{exponential}} stability <b>of</b> switched <b>recurrent</b> neural networks with interval time-varying delay. The time delay is a continuous function belonging to a given interval, but not necessarily differentiable. By constructing a set of argumented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals combined with the Newton-Leibniz formula, a switching rule for exponential stability <b>of</b> switched <b>recurrent</b> neural networks with interval time-varying delay is designed via linear matrix inequalities, and new sufficient conditions for the exponential stability <b>of</b> switched <b>recurrent</b> neural networks with interval time-varying delay via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived.

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining <b>of</b> <b>recurrent</b> oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to describe the various anatomical relations <b>of</b> the <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery in a Central African population. Patients and methodsA prospective study was conducted between January 2012 and December 2012 in 5 otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery departments in Cameroon and Gabon. All patients undergoing total or subtotal thyroidectomy or loboisthmectomy with recurrent laryngeal nerve dissection, with no history of previous thyroid surgery, RLN dissection or tumour infiltration of the RLN, were included. ResultsFifty-six patients were included, corresponding to 36 loboisthmectomies and 20 total or subtotal thyroidectomies. A total <b>of</b> 62 <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerves were identified: 32 on the right and 30 on the left. The course <b>of</b> the <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve in relation to branches of the inferior thyroid artery (ITA) was retrovascular in 53. 1 % of cases on the right and 76. 6 % of cases on the left; transvascular in 15. 6 % of cases on the right and 13. 4 % of cases on the left. The course <b>of</b> the <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve was modified by thyroid disease in 12. 9 % of cases. Six cases (9. 7 %) of extralaryngeal division <b>of</b> the <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve were observed. No case of non-recurrent nerve was observed in this series. ConclusionThe anatomical relations <b>of</b> the <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve with the inferior thyroid artery were very inconstant in this series and were predominantly retrovascular or transvascular in relation to the branches of the artery. The presence of extralaryngeal branches and modification of the course of the nerve by thyroid disease also introduced additional difficulties during recurrent laryngeal nerve dissection. The anatomical relations <b>of</b> the right <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve in this African population differ from the classically described prevascular course...|$|R
