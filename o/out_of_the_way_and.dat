5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the road, making it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to Burnout 3: Takedown, titled Burnout Revenge. Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather than just recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E

5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{returns to}} town, and angrily drags Jex {{to face the}} Gunslinger. Amy asserts that the Doctor has changed for the worse from months of {{travelling}} on his own.

As he dies, Isaac gives the Doctor his marshal badge and has him promise to protect Mercy. The Gunslinger departs, warning he will return for Jex at noon tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest {{a man who}} had daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was the tag team match between John Cena and Batista versus {{the team of}} King Booker and Finlay. Batista {{wrestled}} the match with his left arm taped up due to a previous injury. Both teams wrestlers inconclusively until Cena applied the STFU on Booker. Finlay broke the submission hold, and The Little Bastard ran into the ring. Little Bastard attempted to kick Cena, but accidentally kicked himself in his head when Cena {{moved out of the}} way. Then, Booker tried to superkick Batista, but Batista moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> Booker accidentally hit Finlay. Batista then delivered a Batista Bomb and pinned Booker to earn the victory for his team.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who was laying on his back in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a flying clothesline. However, Van Dam moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled {{out of the ring}} to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} an in-ring segment featuring Raw General Manager William Regal and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, who awarded the WWE Championship to Randy Orton due to John Cena's injury, causing Cena to vacate the title. McMahon informed Orton {{that he would}} have to defend the title that night; Triple H then came to the ring and challenged Orton to a match for the title, which Orton rejected. McMahon, however, relented to Triple H's request and made the match, which became the opening contest of the event. The first match, therefore, pitted WWE Champion Randy Orton defending his title against Triple H. During the match, Orton attempted an RKO, but the move was countered by Triple H into a Pedigree attempt, only for Orton to counter with a back body drop. The match ended shortly after when Orton placed Triple H in the ring turnbuckle and tried to tackle him; Triple H moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> rolled up his opponent for the pinfall. In result, Triple H became WWE Champion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{as he did}} so, the front-running pair of Rubens Barrichello's Jordan and Nigel Mansell's Williams came up to lap him.

25|$|As {{in their}} conquest of Pernambuco, the Dutch West India Company {{was content to}} allow the Portuguese to remain inland.

With the Portuguese <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> an end to Dutch pursuits of troops, Garcia II could finally turn his attention to the growing threat posed by the Count of Soyo.|$|E
