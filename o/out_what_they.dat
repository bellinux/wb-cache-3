5|$|The company {{focuses on}} {{creating}} video games that provoke emotional responses from players. Its employees have stated that, {{while they are}} not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want the player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} {{after the completion}} of Shin Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei If..., but was delayed as the team worked <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted for the game, including making it appeal to a wider audience than previous Megami Tensei games. Unlike the science fiction setting of Shin Megami Tensei II, Nocturne returned to a contemporary setting similar to the original game. The setting and characters were inspired by multiple elements, including Gnosticism, Mahayana Buddhism, and modern popular culture. Among the things the team changed from previous entries were the camera perspective, which was switched from a first- to a third-person camera perspective, and using a cel-shaded art style to distinguish it from other games of the time. The music, primarily composed by Shoji Meguro, paid homage to earlier Megami Tensei titles while drawing on music styles from the 1980s.|$|E

The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin.

Learning the FBI are conducting {{an investigation into the}} Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> know. When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before fleeing. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo he knew there was an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to smoke out the culprit. Aldo pursues Monk, who explains he became disillusioned in the Corleones after Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Furious with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him.|$|E

Meanwhile, he reads the {{newspaper}} in hope that his stock has gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the man who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he will go and visit Wilkinson to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally.|$|E

25|$|The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 {{provided}} the right opportunity and {{circumstances in which}} to establish Canada's first order: the Order of Canada. The system was officially established in 1972 and has since expanded, mostly through the 1990s, and generally attracted little criticism; indeed, the orders, decorations, and medals of Canada inspired other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, to adopt similar approaches in their respective jurisdictions, as did each of Canada's provinces. However, some experts in the field, such as Christopher McCreery, have pointed <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see as deficiencies in the construct: At the 2006 conference on Commonwealth Honours, the concern was raised that Canada {{does not have a}} way to recognize the nation's very best; the three grades of the Order of Canada being insufficient to do so. It was suggested that either two more levels be added to the Order of Canada, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders, or create a new single class but limited-membership order, similar to the Order of New Zealand. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders, contrary to international practice. McCreery echoed these comments in 2010 and added that the Canadian honours system was lacking a polar medal, such as those issued in other northern nations, as well as a public service order, akin to the Imperial Service Order, and honours to specifically recognise protective services other than the police forces.|$|E
500|$|Many historians, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have {{suggested}} that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries were a consequence of the religious struggles of the period, with both the Catholic and Protestant Churches determined to stamp <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> regarded as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as [...] "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", and even as a show-trial, to demonstrate that Lancashire, considered at that time to be a wild and lawless region, was being purged not only of witches but also of [...] "popish plotters" [...] (i.e. recusant Catholics).|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot {{for the life of me}} make <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E

500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it.... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
500|$|On , Rainer Plaga, a German astrophysicist, {{posted a}} {{research}} {{paper on the}} arXiv Web archive concluding that LHC safety studies have not definitely ruled out the potential catastrophic threat from microscopic black holes, including the possible danger from Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. In a follow-up paper posted on the arXiv on , Steven Giddings and Michelangelo Mangano, {{the authors of the}} research paper [...] "Astrophysical implications of hypothetical stable TeV-scale black holes", responded to Plaga's concerns. They pointed <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see as a basic inconsistency in Plaga's calculation, and argued that their own conclusions on the safety of the collider, as referred to in the LHC safety assessment (LSAG) report, remain robust. Giddings and Mangano also referred to the research paper [...] "Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC", which relies on a number of new arguments to conclude that there is no risk due to mini black holes at the LHC. On 19 January 2009 Roberto Casadio, Sergio Fabi and Benjamin Harms posted on the arXiv a paper, later published on Physical Review D, ruling out the catastrophic growth of black holes in the scenario considered by Plaga. In reaction to the criticisms, Plaga updated his paper on the arXiv on 26 September 2008 and again on 9 August 2009. So far, Plaga's paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.|$|E

Prince being another main influence, Usher said [...] "every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres." [...] In Time magazine's [...] "100 Most Influential People" [...] issue, he explained [...] "I was interested in music {{and trying to find}} a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be." [...] In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that [...] "they figured <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they were and what they had to say". Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.|$|E
