5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|The plot <b>of</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Ruin is {{considerably}} darker than, and unrelated to, the plots of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E

The book is interspersed with interviews with several individuals as well as monographs capturing the devastation caused to people and the environment by unchecked post-industrial free market capitalism in the United States, in so called 'sacrifice zones'.|$|R

25|$|Altogether, {{there were}} 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close {{relation}} conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and {{the cycles of}} the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented {{the number of days}} that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1 days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.|$|E

25|$|The {{subject matter}} of the oldest Dutch folk songs (also called ballads, popular songs or romances) is very old and can go back to ancient fairy tales and legends. In fact, apart from ancient tales {{embedded}} in the 13th century Dutch folk songs, and some evidence of Celtic and Germanic mythology in the naming <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the week and landmarks (see for example the 2nd century inscription to goddess Vagdavercustis), the folk tales of the ancient Dutch people were not written down in the first written literature of the 12th century, and thus lost to us.|$|E
25|$|Viking burial rituals were {{complex and}} dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala {{describes}} the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces {{and putting them}} in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, {{it could not have}} solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.|$|E

25|$|This kind {{of damage}} made life in Fort Jackson a misery when {{combined}} with constant flooding from high water within the fort. The crew could be safe from mortar fragments and falling debris only within the dank and partially flooded casemates. Lack of shelter, food, blankets, sleeping quarters, drinkable water, along with the depressing effects <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> heavy, unanswered shelling were hard to bear. When combined with sickness and the ever-present corrosive fear, conditions were definitely a drain on morale. These factors contributed to the mutiny of the Fort Jackson garrison on April 28. This mutiny began a subsequent collapse of resistance downriver from the city. Fort St. Phillips was also surrendered, the CSS Louisiana blown up and even the Confederate fleet on Lake Pontchartrain was destroyed to avoid capture. The general collapse of morale began with the mutiny and greatly simplified the occupation of New Orleans by the Union navy.|$|E
25|$|In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for Days of Our Lives on his TV, {{and went}} on to praise the writers <b>of</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> our Lives for coming up with such good storylines; Days, at that time, was under the helm of James E.

In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that {{it was the kind of}} black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which Passions repeats aired in 2006. Tabitha then told him stick with NBC (Passions network). In an episode later in September 2006, Siren tried to get Miguel into bed by singing her Siren's song. Miguel told her that she should not {{audition}} for America's Got Talent, which airs on NBC. In another episode, Tabitha talked about The Biggest Loser season finale, which was also aired on NBC.
