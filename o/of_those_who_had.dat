With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E

America's Health Rankings Health <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Have</b> Served Report reflects United Health Foundation's commitment to offering data-driven insights that can stimulate dialogue and action that continues to advance the health <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served, and builds upon the United Health Foundation's philanthropic initiatives to support members of the U. S. Armed Forces, veterans, and their families across the country. America's Health Rankings, in partnership with Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), collaborated with an advisory steering group of leading military and veterans and public health organizations to develop a holistic study of the health <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served in the U. S. Armed Forces compared with the health of civilians. The report establishes a baseline portrait of the health <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served, analyzing 24 health measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) –the world's largest, annual population-based telephone survey of more than 400, 000 people...|$|R

5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was trained on the officer.

Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E

S. military compared with the health of civilians in the same age and demographic groups. The report focuses on the health <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> ever served on active duty in the United States Armed Forces, either in regular military or in a National Guard or military reserve unit. Within the sample, the age distribution <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not was adjusted to reflect the U. S. population and provide comparisons for the same age and demographic groups of both populations. The Health <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Have</b> Served Report establishes a national baseline portrait of the health <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> ever served in active duty, analyzing 24 health measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)  the world's largest, annual population-based telephone survey of over 400, 000 people. The measures include indicators of health behaviors, health outcomes and utilization of key health care services. United Health Foundation also produces the annual America's Health Rankings Annual Report and has recently expanded its reporting series to include a number of spotlight reports focused on important markers of the nation's health, including prevention and the impacts of unhealthy behaviors, and population reports {{on the health of}} seniors and the health of women and children...|$|R

5|$|On November 21, 2010 Microsoft {{sold the}} game {{including}} its two expansion packs {{as a part}} of its relaunch of its Games for Windows Live platform for 10 cents or 10 Microsoft points. The overwhelming and unanticipated demand created a shortage of account keys leaving some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> purchased the game through the promotion unable to install the game. Microsoft remedied this issue by assuring all customers who purchased the game that account keys would be generated within one week and automatically uploaded to each profile. As a result of this promotion the overall sales of the game have sharply increased.|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, denouncing the move.

Shortly afterwards, the residence permit {{of one of}} the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.|$|E

5|$|Since the 14th century, the Ming {{court had}} {{enforced}} the maritime prohibition laws that strictly forbade all private maritime activities {{in order to}} prevent contact with foreigners by sea. When the Manchu Qing dynasty took over China, Hong Kong was directly affected by the Great Clearance decree of the Kangxi Emperor, who ordered the evacuation of coastal areas of Guangdong from 1661 to 1669. Over 16,000 inhabitants of Xin'an County including those in Hong Kong were forced to migrate inland; only 1,648 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> evacuated subsequently returned.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|While La Salle was gone, six <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{remained}} on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors {{did not know how}} to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, who was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald {{is known to have}} become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after {{she had told him}} she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
