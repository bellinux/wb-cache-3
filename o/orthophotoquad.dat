40|$|A {{simulated}} {{data set}} {{was used to}} evaluate techniques for extracting topography from side-looking satellite systems for an area of northwest Washington state. A negative transparency <b>orthophotoquad</b> was digitized at a spacing of 85 microns, resulting in an equivalent ground distance of 9. 86 m between pixels and a radiometric resolution of 256 levels. A bilinear interpolation was performed on digital elevation model data to generate elevation data at a 9. 86 -m resolution. The nominal orbital characteristics and geometry of the SPOT satellite were convoluted with the data to produce simulated panchromatic HRV digital stereo imagery for three different orbital paths and techniques for reconstructing topographic data were developed. Analyses with the simulated HRV data and other data sets show that the method is effective...|$|E
40|$|To make aerial imagery {{products}} {{more useful}} and timely the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team (FHTET) has recently integrated an Applanix Airborne POS system into its image acquisition procedures. This automated aerial triangulation system (without ground control) eliminates {{the time and}} expense of collecting ground control points for every image and results in rapid project turnaround. To assess {{the performance of the}} Applanix system 15 random images were selected from images taken during recent missions over Mississippi and Texas in response to hurricane forest damage. From each of the images 10 random points are compared to the equivalent location on USDA Forest Service <b>orthophotoquads</b> and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) orthoimagery. A statistical comparison was made to test how closely images processed through automated aerial triangulation match traditional USDA Forest Service digital <b>orthophotoquads</b> and NAIP imagery...|$|R

40|$|Utilization of {{new sources}} of statewide remote sensing data, taken from high-altitude {{aircraft}} and from spacecraft is discussed along with incorporation of information extracted from these sources into on-going land and resources management programs in Arizona. Statewide cartographic applications of remote sensor data taken by NASA high-altitude aircraft include {{the development of a}} statewide semi-analytic control network, the production of nearly 1900 <b>orthophotoquads</b> (image maps) that are coincident in scale and area with the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7. 5 minute topographic quadrangle map series, and satellite image maps of Arizona produced from LANDSAt multispectral scanner imagery. These cartographic products are utilized {{for a wide variety of}} experimental and operational earth resources applications. Applications of the imagery, image maps, and derived information discussed include: soils and geologic mapping projects, water resources investigations, land use inventories, environmental impact studies, highway route locations and mapping, vegetation cover mapping, wildlife habitat studies, power plant siting studies, statewide delineation of irrigation cropland, position determination of drilling sites, pictorial geographic bases for thematic mapping, and court exhibits...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} demonstrated that urbanization has negative environmental consequences, the conversion of land to urban use is increasing worldwide and {{is not likely to}} abate. We tested the hypothesis that different urban typologies, i. e., distributions of human population and infrastructure, differentially influence the water quality and ecological functionality of emergent marsh wetlands in New York State&# 039;s Hudson River Valley. Wetlands were studied in two watersheds, defined as landscapes bounded by ridge lines, containing traditional small-town development and two watersheds containing suburban typologies. Land cover attributes were evaluated by analyzing ground-truthed, <b>orthophotoquad</b> data with a GIS. Water quality, the cover and biomass of emergent vascular plants, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton biomass, and planktonic trophic transfer efficiency were measured in the wetlands during the fall of 2000, the summer and fall of 2001, and the summer and fall of 2002. Of the 13 variables measured, five exhibited typological differences according to the results of student t-tests. The interactions between these variables were quantified by least squares regression. Two key attributes of urban systems, i. e., the amount of vegetated buffer between the urban landscape and receiving waters and the amount of land in urban use, appeared to strongly influence water quality and ecosystem function in the wetlands studied. Nonpoint source loading and the success of exotic emergent macrophytic invasions varied directly with urban land use and inversely with buffer width. Trophic transfer efficiency declined with urban land use and increased with buffer width. The amounts of buffer and urban land use in a watershed appear to vary systematically with urban typology. Thus, watersheds that were developed in accordance with suburban design criteria exhibited more urban land use and less riparian buffering than did watersheds containing comparably scaled traditional small-town typologies...|$|E
40|$|Currently, digital soils {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} many sources. Numerous websites serve digital soils information but often users need their own GIS software and considerable knowledge to view the data. A planned IMS Web Soil Survey site will eliminate the need for GIS software, but will rely on a fairly fast internet connection. The Indiana Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office has published more than 200 project areas on CD-ROM utilizing a customized run-time version of ArcView accessible to novice computer users and most available computers. Using a customized ArcView application on CD-ROM, the user can access information easily through many unique tools, without needing web access. Future plans for this project include migrating to an ArcGIS format. SoilView History The first effort to provide tools making ESRI-format Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) data easier to use resulted from discussions with the Illinois National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) staff with input from soil survey users. Their vision was to make this information more easily accessible to the general public. An agreement was made between ESRI and the Illinois Soil Conservation Service (now NRCS) to produce a viewer of soils information that could be distributed freely to the general public. In the mid 1990 s, the Illinois Soil Conservation Service GIS Specialist worked with ESRI programmers to create a viewer using ArcView Data Publishing (AVDP) that would allow users to view digital soils information over an <b>orthophotoquad</b> image base without requiring the user to obtain proprietary GIS software. The name “SoilView ” was coined, and the first county publication using AVDP was distributed on CD-ROM in 1999. The first viewer used a runtime version of ArcView that could be operated independently and distributed freely on a CD-ROM. Initial versions were designed to be installed on the user’s computer hard drive while later versions ran directly from the CD-ROM. Modern versions of SoilView can be run from th...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{mapping of}} stream channel {{networks}} {{is important for}} measuring hydrologic parameters, for site plan-ning in construction projects, and for use in hydrologic models. This article compares five existing and two new methods for extracting stream channel networks for use in topographic mapping. In order of increasing accuracy, these methods are: (1) blue lines on USGS 1 : 24, 000 topographic maps (64. 6 percent underrepresentation), (2) placing stream heads using a constant flow-accumulation area to mimic USGS blue lines (47. 8 percent under-representation), (3) constant flow-accumulation area equal to the mean for identified channel heads (30. 3 per-cent combined under- and overrepresentation), (4) variable flow-accumulation area estimated by multiple linear regression (28. 9 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), (5) variable flow-accumulation area esti-mated by a slope-power relationship (23. 6 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), (6) identifying stream cells using logistic regression (12. 7 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), and (7) extracting stream channel head locations from digital <b>orthophotoquads</b> (DOQs) (nearly 100 percent accurate, but only applicable under ideal conditions). Methods 2 – 6 require 10 m resolution digital elevation models that can be acquired directly in many areas or {{can be derived from}} 1 : 24, 000 hypsography where available; Methods 4 and 6 are new methods developed in this paper. Using DOQs, while extremely accurate, is labor intensive and can be applied only in a small minority of locations where vegetation cover does not obscure channel head locations. We conclude that identifying stream cells using logistic regression has the broadest applicability because it can be implemented in an automated fashion using only DEMs while still achieving accuracies for mapping low-order streams that are far superior t...|$|R
