40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{equilibrium}} of after-tax {{rates of return}} described in Miller (1977) by investigating whether a change in tax rates affects the return of an investment asset that is not directly taxed by the rate being changed. Using a model of after-tax investment returns I predict the yields of Treasury bills, which are subject only to ordinary tax rates, have an inverse reaction {{to changes in the}} <b>capital</b> gains <b>tax</b> rate. In a sample of daily Treasury bill data, yields appear to increase in response to the surprise reduction in <b>capital</b> gains <b>tax</b> rates on May 7, 1997. While small, this increase is statistically significant and is robust to other macroeconomic determinants. These findings contribute to the accounting literature on taxes and investment pricing by providing evidence of Miller's after-tax equilibrium in a potentially cleaner setting than is used in previous studies. Evidence that a financial instrument subject to ordinary rates alone may be affected by the announcement of a change in the <b>capital</b> gains <b>tax</b> rate suggests that shareholder-level taxes are capitalized into prices in ways not investigated by existing research. Accounting researchers will find these results useful because they suggest that the effects of changes in tax rates on asset prices are likely misstated in studies using settings where both the <b>ordinary</b> and <b>capital</b> gains <b>tax</b> rates change. Since the Treasury bill yield forms the basis of many consumer contracts, such as credit card agreements, policy makers should also be interested in these findings because they suggest changes to the <b>capital</b> gains <b>tax</b> rate may have unintended market consequences...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{uncertainty}} is often {{claimed to be}} harmful for investments. <b>Capital</b> <b>taxes,</b> such as property and wealth taxes, are particularly exposed to <b>tax</b> uncertainty. <b>Capital</b> <b>tax</b> un- certainty emerges from expected tax reforms, the unclear outcome of future tax audits, and simplified estimates of <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> bases in investment models. Uncertain returns on investment as well as stochastic taxation contribute to overall uncertainty and may significantly affect investment decisions. Hitherto, it is unknown how <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> uncertainty affects investment timing. However, {{it is well known}} that both uncertainty and <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> may be harmful for investment and decelerate investment activities. We are the first to study the investment timing effects of stochastic <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> in a real options setting with risky investment opportunities. Our results indicate that even risk neutral investors are sensitive with respect to <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> risk and may react in a surprising manner to a newly introduced stochastic <b>capital</b> <b>tax.</b> As an apparently paradoxical investment e¤ect, we find that increased <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> uncertainty can accelerate risky investment if such {{uncertainty is}} such ciently low compared to cash flow uncertainty. In contrast, high <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> risk delays high-risk innovative investment projects. To reduce unintended consequences of uncertain tax policy, tax legislators and tax authorities should avoid high levels of cap- ital tax uncertainty. Broadening the <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> base or increasing the <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> rate induces ambiguous timing effects. Furthermore, high-growth investments are likely to be postponed if they experience a <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> cut.

We do so by emphasising two {{previously}} neglected implications of non-cooperative <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> setting in a fully dynamic environment. First, in a truly-dynamic environment, the returns to the non-capital factors of production and thereby disposable income and savings depend on predetermined capital stock. Thus, capital-market clearing interest rates depend also on past rates and taxes. Hence, taxes affect future interest rates, and thereby future consumption levels, <b>capital</b> stocks and <b>tax</b> revenues abroad. Second, in an overlapping generations economy, the effect of <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> on the current income of different generations {{is not the same}} across generations. The reason is that for old generations <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> affect the returns to their savings, while for younger generations <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> affect their non-capital income.

40|$|What are the {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} tax adjustments {{in response to}} large public debt shocks in highly integrated economies? The answer from standard closed-economy models is deceptive, because they underestimate the elasticity of <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> revenues and ignore crosscountry spillovers of tax changes. Instead, we examine this issue using a two-country model that matches the observed elasticity of the <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> base by introducing endogenous capacity utilization and a partial depreciation allowance. Tax hikes have adverse effects on macro aggregates and welfare, and trigger strong cross-country externalities. Quantitative analysis calibrated to European data shows that unilateral <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> increases cannot restore fiscal solvency, because the dynamic Laffer curve peaks below the required revenue increase. Unilateral labor tax hikes can do it, but have negative output and welfare effects at home and raise welfare and output abroad. Large spillovers also imply that unilateral <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> hikes are much less costly under autarky than under free trade. Allowing for one-shot Nash tax competition, the model predicts a "race to the bottom" in <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> and higher labor taxes.
