5000|$|Wine on tap {{utilizes}} {{cost savings}} at all levels, from the manufacturer, retailer and consumer. Traditionally, wine retailers have served wine {{by the glass}} by opening and resealing individual bottles. With wine on tap, bottle, cork, and carton costs are eliminated. Costs of waste from throwing away <b>oxidized</b> <b>wine</b> are also decreased and fresher unoxidized wine is delivered to the consumer. Transport costs are significantly reduced as well, as {{the same amount of}} wine weighs significantly more in bottles than in a keg. Further, the disposable one way kegs require even less transportation than the steel kegs because they are disposable and recyclable ...|$|E
25|$|The use of oak {{in white}} wine has {{declined}} significantly {{in recent times}} when before the norm was traditionally 2–5 years in oak. This created slightly <b>oxidized</b> <b>wines</b> with flavors of caramel, coffee, and roasted nuts that did not appeal to a large market of consumers {{with some of the}} more negative examples showing characteristics of rubber and petrol flavors. Today the focus of white wine makers has been to enhance the vibrancy and fruit flavors of the wine.|$|R
25|$|Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid) {{is present}} in the grape and the must up to 50 milligrams per litre. It is a {{protection}} in the wort against the oxidation phenomenon. In the presence of oxygen it produces hydrogen peroxide; by this reaction it deprives the enzymes in the wort of oxygen that is necessary to <b>oxidize</b> the <b>wine.</b> Since 1962 the addition of vitamin C in the wine has been allowed to a maximum of 15 grams per hectolitre at the time of packaging to stabilize the wine. Experiments in the late 2000s tried to determine a method to add it to fresh harvests or in the wort.|$|R
5000|$|Verdejo is {{a variety}} of wine grape {{that has long been}} grown in the Rueda region of Spain. The grape {{originated}} in North Africa, and was spread to Rueda in about the 11th Century, possibly by Mozarabs. Verdejo was generally used to make a strongly <b>oxidized,</b> Sherry-like <b>wine.</b> In the 1970s, the winemaking company Marqués de Riscal began to develop a fresher style of white wine based on Verdejo with the help of French oenologist Émile Peynaud. In 1980, white wines from the Rueda region were recognized by a Denominación de Origen (DO). Wines labeled Rueda must contain 50% Verdejo; the remainder is typically Sauvignon blanc or Macabeo. Wines designated [...] "Rueda Verdejo" [...] must contain 85% Verdejo, and are often 100% Verdejo.|$|R
40|$|During the wine-making {{process and}} ageing, the {{formation}} of various groups of pyranoanthocyanins leads to enhance and to stabilize the red wine colour. Although their chemical properties and their formation kinetics have been well-described, data about their sensory impact are scarce. Micro-oxygenation {{can be used to}} favor {{the formation of}} pyranoanthocyanins and also to improve wine quality. For this study, both analytical and sensory aspects were used. Purification steps applied on an <b>oxidized</b> red <b>wine</b> lead to characterize three new original compounds. Sensory analysis was declined into two aspects. First the purification of an A-type vitisin-rich fraction will be used for evaluating the possible sensory impact of pyranoanthocyanins; then the correlation between the tasting of micro-oxygenated red wines and the concentrations of these wine samples in pyranoanthocyanins will determine if these pigments could enhance aroma characteristics...|$|R
25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation {{in as much as}} it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to <b>oxidize.</b> The resulting <b>wine</b> has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|R
25|$|For {{the most}} part the Chileans ignored these restrictions, preferring their {{domestic}} production to the <b>oxidized</b> and vinegary <b>wines</b> that didn't fare well during the long voyages from Spain. They were even so bold as to start exporting some of their wines to neighboring Peru with one such export shipment being captured at sea by the English privateer Francis Drake. When Spain heard of the event rather than being outraged at Drake, an indictment was sent back to Chile with the order to uproot most of their vineyards. This order, too, was mostly ignored.|$|R
40|$|Heterocyclic acetals from {{acetaldehyde}} and glycerol {{have been}} proposed as markers of age and oxidation in fortified wines. Here the analysis of these acetals (cis- and trans- 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxane and cis- and trans- 4 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane) by liquid–liquid extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was optimized for rapid monitoring of these compounds in aged and <b>oxidized</b> table <b>wines.</b> The method provides {{a wide range of}} linearity and reproducibility below 3. 0 % RSD, while the detection limits, 2. 85 – 13. 5 μg/L, were significantly lower than typical levels measured in wines. Stable isotope dilution improved the accuracy of the method. Oxidation of red wines was shown to correlate with increased levels of the acetals. The accuracy and speed of the new method will allow for quantifying oxidation in large experiments such as wine aging or micro-oxygenation trials, and to assess the potential value of these substances as markers of wine oxidation...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{wines are}} {{packaged}} in thick plastic bags within corrugated fiberboard boxes, and are called [...] "box wines", or [...] "cask wine". Tucked inside {{the package is}} a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh {{for up to a}} month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled <b>wine</b> <b>oxidizes</b> more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.|$|R
50|$|Jura's {{most famous}} and {{distinguishable}} wine is the sherry-like vin jaune. The wine is produced by picking the Savagnin as ripe as possible, in some cases becoming a sort of late harvest wine, and after fermentation storing it in Burgundian aging barrels for over 6 years. The barrels are filled {{up to the top}} and allowed to evaporate, reducing the volume in the barrel and a creating an air pocket {{at the top of the}} barrel. During this time the <b>wine</b> <b>oxidizes</b> and grows a film of yeast that is similar, but not the same strain, as the Jerez region flor. The wine is then bottled in a signature clavelin wine bottle that holds 62 cL. Vin jaune is an intensely flavored wine that often requires decanting prior to drinking.|$|R
2500|$|The {{taste of}} most of the wine world was still geared towards sweet and strong wines, and the Portuguese were seeing great success in adding brandy to make their port wines stronger. The Jerezanos began to {{experiment}} with adding brandy to Sherry and discovered that the increased alcohol content also had the effect of killing off the flor, which then made the <b>wine</b> <b>oxidize</b> more and develop into another style of wine. The merchants began to call this wine oloroso meaning [...] "pungent". The Sherry makers in Sanlúcar were a little more restrained in the use of their brandy, finding that the unique aspect of flor took on new distinction amid the salty sea breezes that cooled most of the area's bodegas. The finos produced here were even lighter and more delicate with a freshness reminiscent of apples. They began to call these wines manzanilla or [...] "little apple".|$|R
2500|$|Heat damaged {{wines are}} often casually {{referred}} to as cooked, which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. [...] The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13°C (55°F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible {{along the length of}} the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged <b>wines</b> often become <b>oxidized,</b> and red <b>wines</b> may take on a brick color.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{fermentation}} {{phase of}} sherry production the flor yeast work anaerobically, converting sugar into ethanol. When all the sugar has been consumed, the physiology of the yeast change {{to where they}} begin an aerobic process of breaking down and converting the acids into other compounds such as acetaldehyde. A waxy coating appears on the cells' exterior, causing the yeast to float {{to the surface and}} form a protective [...] "blanket" [...] thick enough to shield the wine from oxygen. This process drastically lowers the acidity of the wine and makes Sherries one of the most aldehydic wines in the world. Studies have shown that for the flor to survive and thrive the wine must stay between the narrow alcohol range of 14.5 to 16% ABV. Below 14.5%, the yeast do not form their protective waxy cap and the <b>wine</b> <b>oxidizes</b> to the point of becoming vinegar. Above 16% and the flor can not survive, the wine essentially becoming an oloroso.|$|R
50|$|During the Spanish rule, {{vineyards}} were {{restricted in}} production with the stipulation that the Chilean should purchase {{the bulk of}} their wines directly from Spain itself. In 1641, wine imports from Chile and the Viceroyalty of Peru into Spain were banned, severely damaging the wine industry in the colony. The market loss caused the huge surplus of grapes to be made into pisco and aguardiente. The concentration solely on pisco production, nearly eliminated wine production in Peru.For the most part the Chileans ignored these restrictions, preferring their domestic production to the <b>oxidized</b> and vinegary <b>wines</b> that didn't fare well during the long voyages from Spain. They were even so bold as to start exporting some of their wines to neighboring Peru with one such export shipment being captured at sea by the English privateer Francis Drake. When Spain heard of the event rather than being outraged at Drake, an indictment was sent back to Chile with the order to uproot most of their vineyards. This order, too, was mostly ignored.|$|R
40|$|Empirical thesis. Spine title: Botrytis protease. Bibliography: pages 42 - 46. Introduction/ Literature review [...] Methods [...] Results [...] Discussion. Protein haze in wine {{is caused}} by plant {{pathogenesis}} related (PR 0 proteins that precipitate when heated, cause the wine to look cloudy and render it unsaleable. Advancements {{have been made to}} reduce the economic, environmental and wine quality impacts that come with traditional bentonite stabilisation. Enzymatic treatment with recombinant proteins has shown some promise, however genetically modified organisms cannot be used in Australian commercial winemaking. In order to find a non-genetically modified alternative for protein haze removal, 99 isolates of Botrytis cinerea were initially screened for strong growth and sporulation, with 55 of these isolates selected and screened for protease production by skim milk plate clearing assay. These results coupled with guaiacol plate assays to assess laccase production from these isolates, which would <b>oxidize</b> the finished <b>wine,</b> resulted in 6 B. cinerea isolates that were assessed for protease secretion in liquid culture. Analyses of the protease and laccase production of these isolates by fluorescence microplate and syringaldazine assays identified 6 B. cinerea isolates that secrete high levels of protease, to be used in continuing research.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{during the}} vinification {{is an important}} problem {{for the production of}} wine because it affects to the organoleptic propertys of wine, it changes the flavour and the colour. A research study is made from La Vinyeta winery about its wine-making procedures strating from the barrel to the bottle following the steps of transfer, clarification, estabilization (with CMC or in cold temperature) and filtration with the intention de find possible mistakes that causes an important oxidation in wine. The selected sample is the wine called Llavors, a red aged wine. To be able to study the oxidation on every step of the process, different experiments are performed: – The dissolved oxygen is analyzed because of its capacity to <b>oxidize</b> the <b>wine</b> if it isn't controlled. The analysis is performed with two different sounding lines. – The amount of free SO 2 is analyzed because it is the main character to protect the wine from oxidation thanks to its antioxidant properties. The analysis is perfomed with an automatic titrator. – The wine browning is analyzed to control if the oxidation is enough to cause changes in the colour. The analysis is performed with an spectrophotometer UV-VIS. – Volatil esters that can be used as reference of oxidation are analyzed using a gas cromatography connected to a mass spectrometer with an ion trap and using head space solid phase microextraction as an extraction technique. Except the estabilitzation procedure, the wine-making procedures have proved its fiability. This procedures aren't affected by a huge oxidation. The dissolved oxygen levels remain constant throught the process as the levels of free SO 2 do, that proves a good protection for the wine. The suffering oxidation isn't enough to change the coulour of the wine. Volatil esters that decrease their own concentration when the oxidation is growing up are determined like the hexanoic acid ethyl ester or the isoamyl acetate. In the end, this study has been compared to other similar studies watching differences on the results due to the different variety of the grapes and in the followed procedur...|$|R
