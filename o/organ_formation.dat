50|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the embryo-fetal development, including the maternal-fetal interactions during gestation, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of toxicity and test the toxic effect in more than two species before confirming the substance to be a developmental toxicant. Embryo have different critical periods for the <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> from day 15 to day 60 and hence the susceptibility to toxicant injury is directly related to the period of development.|$|E
50|$|Though {{each plant}} grows {{according}} to a certain set of rules, each new root and shoot meristem can go on growing {{for as long as}} it is alive. In many plants, meristematic growth is potentially indeterminate, making the overall shape of the plant not determinate in advance. This is the primary growth. Primary growth leads to lengthening of the plant body and <b>organ</b> <b>formation.</b> All plant organs arise ultimately from cell divisions in the apical meristems, followed by cell expansion and differentiation. Primary growth gives rise to the apical part of many plants.|$|E

5000|$|The dust-like {{seeds of}} orchids have no endosperm. Orchid {{seedlings}} are mycoheterotrophic {{in their early}} development. In some other species, such as coffee, the endosperm also does not develop. Instead, the nucellus produces a nutritive tissue termed [...] "perisperm". The endosperm of some species is responsible for seed dormancy. Endosperm tissue also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo, it acts {{as a location for}} gene imprinting, and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents. In angiosperms, the endosperm contain hormones such as cytokinins, which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic <b>organ</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Conium maculatum is {{poisonous}} to animals. In a short time, the alkaloids {{produce a}} potentially fatal neuromuscular blockage when the respiratory muscles are affected. Acute toxicity, if not lethal, may resolve in the spontaneous {{recovery of the}} affected animals provided further exposure is avoided. It has been observed that poisoned animals tend to return to feed on this plant. Chronic toxicity affects only pregnant animals. When they are poisoned by C. maculatum during the fetus' <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> period, the offspring is born with malformations, mainly palatoschisis and multiple congenital contractures (MCC; frequently described as arthrogryposis). Chronic toxicity is irreversible and although MCC can be surgically corrected in some cases, most of the malformed animals are lost. Such losses may be underestimated, {{at least in some}} regions, because of the difficulty in associating malformations with the much earlier maternal poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Haploinsufficiency of the TBX1 gene (T-box {{transcription}} factor TBX1) {{is thought to}} be the cause of some of the symptoms observed. Point mutations in this gene have also been observed in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. TBX1 is part of the T-box family of genes which have an important role in tissue and <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> during embryonic development and it may have a role in the regulation of differentiation of post migration neural crest cells. The neural crest forms many of the structures affected in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, including the skull bones, mesenchyme of the face and palate, the outflow tract of the heart, and the thymus and parathyroid stroma. When there is a loss of expression of FGF18 during the development of the pharyngeal arches, neural crest cell death is seen. Although neither FGF18 or TBX1 are expressed in the neural crest cells, TBX1 might have a role in the regulation of FGF18 expression, ensuring that the differentiation of these cells in the pharyngeal region is correct. Therefore, dysfunction of TBX1 may be responsible for some of the symptoms in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.|$|E

Populations of Polyalthia coffeoides and P. korinti have been studied in dry and intermediate zone forests of Sri Lanka. The petals separate early in development, but subsequently close to form a pollination chamber over the reproductive <b>organs.</b> <b>Formation</b> of the chamber is coincident with elevated internal temperatures and scent production over a twoday period. GC-MS analysis of the odour reveals the presence of volatiles that mimic beetle sex pheromones. The primary effective pollinator of both species is an Endaeus weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), with pollen grains generally observed around the mouthparts and legs. The weevils are abundant and active around the flowers in the late evening and overnight. The flowers are protogynous, and studies of pollen/ovule ratios suggest that both species are facultatively xenogamous; this is corroborated by controlled pollination experiments, which reveal greater fruitset following cross-pollination than self-pollination. Variation in ISSR molecular markers indicates that both species have a mixed mating system...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTransplantation of in-vitro-generated organ buds is a {{promising}} approach toward regenerating functional and vascularized organs. Though {{it has been}} recently shown {{in the context of}} liver models, demonstrating the applicability of this approach to other systems by delineating the molecular mechanisms guiding <b>organ</b> bud <b>formation</b> is critical. Here, we demonstrate a generalized method for <b>organ</b> bud <b>formation</b> from diverse tissues by combining pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue-specific progenitors or relevant tissue samples with endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The MSCs initiated condensation within these heterotypic cell mixtures, which was dependent upon substrate matrix stiffness. Defining optimal mechanical properties promoted formation of 3 D, transplantable organ buds from tissues including kidney, pancreas, intestine, heart, lung, and brain. Transplanted pancreatic and renal buds were rapidly vascularized and self-organized into functional, tissue-specific structures. These findings provide a general platform for harnessing mechanical properties to generate vascularized, complex organ buds with broad applications for regenerative medicine...|$|R

40|$|The {{plant cell}} wall has a {{somewhat}} paradoxical mechanical {{role in the}} plant: it must {{be strong enough to}} resist the high turgor of the cell contents, but at the right moment it must yield to that pressure to allow cell growth. The control of the cell wall's mechanical properties underlies its ability to regulate growth correctly. Recently, we have reported on changes in cell wall elasticity associated with <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> at the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana. These changes in cell wall elasticity were strongly correlated with changes in pectin matrix chemistry, and we have previously shown that changes in pectin chemistry can dramatically effect <b>organ</b> <b>formation.</b> These findings point to a important role of the cell wall pectin matrix in cell growth control of higher plants.

40|$|Research {{support by}} DE-FG 02 - 96 ER 20227 {{focused on the}} CLV loci and their {{regulation}} of <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> at the Arabidopsis shoot meristem. Shoot meristem function is central to plant development as all of the above-ground organs and tissues of the plant are derived post-embryonically from the shoot meristem. At the shoot meristem, stem cells are maintained, and progeny cells undergo a switch toward differentiation and <b>organ</b> <b>formation.</b> The CLV loci, represented by three genes CLV 1, CLV 2 and CLV 3 are key regulators of meristem development. Each of the CLV loci encode a putative receptor-mediated signaling component. When this work began, virtually nothing was known about receptor-mediated signaling in plants. Thus, {{our goal was to}} both characterize these genes and the proteins they encode as regulators of meristem development, and to investigate how receptor-mediated signaling might function in plants.

40|$|Postembryonic {{development}} in higher plants {{is marked by}} repetitive <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> via a self-perpetuating stem cell system, the shoot meristem. Organs are initiated at the shoot meristem periphery, while a central zone harbors the stem cells. Here we show by genetic and molecular analyses that the ZWILLE (ZLL) gene is specifically required to establish the central-peripheral organization of the embryo apex and that this step is critical for shoot meristem self-perpetuation. zll mutants correctly initiate expression of the shoot meristem-specific gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS in early embryos, but fail to regulate its spatial expression pattern at later embryo stages and initiate differentiated structures in place of stem cells. We isolated the ZLL gene by map-based cloning. It encodes a novel protein, and related sequences are highly conserved in multicellular plants and animals but are absent from bacteria and yeast. We propose that ZLL relays positional information required to maintain stem cells of the developing shoot meristem in an undifferentiated state during the transition from embryonic development to repetitive postembryonic <b>organ</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The plant {{rhizosphere}} harbors {{many different}} microorganisms, ranging from plant growth-promoting bacteria to devastating plant parasites. Some of these microbes {{are able to}} induce de novo <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> in infected roots. Certain soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, form a symbiotic interaction with legumes, leading {{to the formation of}} nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Sedentary endoparasitic nematodes, on the other hand, induce highly specialized feeding sites in infected plant roots from which they withdraw nutrients. In order to establish these new root structures, it is thought that these organisms use and manipulate the endogenous molecular and physiological pathways of their hosts. Over the years, evidence has accumulated reliably demonstrating the involvement of the plant hormone auxin. Moreover, the auxin responses during microbe-induced de novo <b>organ</b> <b>formation</b> seem to be dynamic, suggesting that plant-associated microbes can actively modify their host's auxin transport.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the in vitro preservation of yam genetic resources through reduction of the number of subcultures. Effects of different concentrations of activated charcoal (1 g. l- 1, 2 g. l- 1 and 3 g. l- 1) and temporary darkness were tested on the in vitro morphogenesis of three beninese yam accessions (Dcr 28, Dcr 164 and Da 93 G 1). Galzy glutamine was used as basis culture medium and explants were microcuttings obtained from four months old plantlets. The results indicated that the activated charcoal, alone or combined with temporary darkness has an inhibitory effect on the aerial <b>organs</b> <b>formation</b> but favors root development with a greater mean number of root shoots (9. 3 ± 1. 67 with 3 g. l- 1 of activated charcoal) than the subtract without activated charcoal (2. 5 ± 0. 17).
