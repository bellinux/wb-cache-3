60|$|Growling savagely, he {{continued}} his walk. One of the turns to the left, which he had to make, led him through a dark and narrow street. Here, keeping carefully {{in the middle of}} the road for security, he looked sharply on either side, having his hands out of his pockets now, and clenched, for he fully expected another yell. He was wrong, however, in his expectations. The Bloater happened to know of a long ladder, whose nightly place of repose was on the ground in a certain dark passage, with its end pointing across that street. Taking up a position beside this ladder, with Little Jim--who followed him, almost bursting with delight--he bided his time and kept as quiet as a mouse. Just in the nick of time the ladder was run <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> Mr Sparks <b>tripping</b> <b>over</b> it, fell violently to the ground. He sprang up and gave chase, of course, but he might as well have followed a will-o'-the-wisp. The young scamps, doubling like hares, took refuge in a dark recess under a stair with which they were well acquainted, and from that position they watched their enemy. They heard him go growling past; knew, a moment or two later, from the disappointed tone of the growl, that he had found the opening at the other end of the passage; heard him return, growling, and saw him for a moment in the dim light of the entrance as he left the place. Then, swiftly issuing from their retreat, they followed.|$|R
