40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{construction}} design and practical realisation of experimental apparatus for investigation of wheel <b>flange</b> track vehicle <b>lubrication.</b> Experimental apparatus in full-scale uses optical interferometry for investigation of lubrication behaviour in wheel flange contact. It is an innovative approach {{which has not}} been used for such experiments so far. The aim of the following measurement with this apparatus is to determine the minimal amount of ecological <b>lubrication</b> in wheel <b>flange</b> contact under certain conditions when there is no lubrication film interruption.

40|$|Railway <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> can be unreliable, {{resulting}} in intermittent rather than continuous lubrication. Twin-disc contact simulation tests {{were carried out}} to investigate the influence of intermittent lubrication on rail steel fatigue life, using both a colloidal suspension of molybdenum disulphide in an oil carrier fluid (similar to a commercial <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> product) and water. A brief interruption of the lubricant supply during molybdenum disulphide lubrication produced rapid surface failure of the rail steel, which was followed by rapid contact fatigue crack growth upon reapplication of the lubricant. During water lubrication the interruption of the lubricant (water) supply did not produce such rapid crack growth. The results {{were found to be}} in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the three-mechanism model of rolling contact fatigue, which combines the mechanisms of ratchetting (accumulation of unidirectional plastic strain until the critical failure strain of the material is reached) and the fracture mechanics-based mechanisms of shear stress driven and tensile fluid assisted crack growth. Analysis of the test results using this model revealed crack face friction to be an important factor controlling crack growth, which may be responsible for the difference in behaviour between contacts lubricated with the molybdenum disulphide-based lubricant and those lubricated by water...|$|R
50|$|Eight six-car trains {{supplied}} by CAF Beasain were imported from Spain. CAF holds 5% {{equity in the}} DAME project and Reliance Infrastructure holds the remaining 95%. The trains on this line are of a premium standard and have in-built noise reduction features for a noise-free ride with padded fabric seats. The coaches are equipped with LCD screens for entertainment of the passengers and also provide flight information for convenience of air travellers. The trains are fitted with an event recorder which can withstand high levels of temperature and impact and the wheels have <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> system for less noise and better riding comfort.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{the aim is}} for {{trains to}} run without flange contact, which also depends on the tyre profile of the wheels. Allowance {{has to be made}} for the {{different}} speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment. Many high-speed lines do not permit slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the impact is reduced by the use of <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication.</b>|$|R

50|$|The allowed {{unbalanced}} superelevation {{will cause}} trains {{to run with}} normal flange contact. The points of wheel-rail contact {{are influenced by the}} tire profile of the wheels. Allowance has to be made for the different speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment if speeds and superelevation are not within the permitted limits. Many high-speed lines do not permit the use of slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads.

40|$|Twin-disc contact {{simulation}} tests {{were carried out}} to investigate the influence of contact pressure variation on rail steel fatigue life. Both a colloidal suspension of molybdenum disulphide in an oil carrier fluid (similar to a commercial <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> product) and water were used as lubricants. It {{was found that the}} reduction from 1500 to 900 MPa of the maximum Hertzian contact pressure (at which a molybdenum-disulphide-lubricated and previously worn rail sample was tested) extended the fatigue life of the rail steel by over five times. For water lubrication a similar reduction in contact pressure produced only a marginal increase in fatigue life. The results were found to be in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the newly developed Three Mechanism (TM) model of rolling contact fatigue, which is introduced here. This model combines the mechanisms of ratcheting and the fracture mechanics-based mechanisms of both shear stress- and tensile stress-driven, fluid-assisted, crack growth...|$|R
40|$|The wheel wear {{prediction}} is a key-topic {{in the field}} of railway research as it has big impact on economical and safety aspects of trainset design, operation and maintenance. The aim of this work was to implement a flexible and pre-dictive railway wheel wear tool that, starting from a specific vehicle mission, provides the wheel profile evolution {{as a function of the}} distance run. The we-ar estimation tool consists of the use of a sequence of pre and post-processing packages, in which the methodologies now presented are implemented, inter-faced with a commercial multibody software that is used to study the railway dynamics. The computational tool is applied here to several simulation sce-narios. The purpose is to demonstrate its capabilities on wear prediction by evaluating the influence of trainset design and of track layout on the wheel wear growth. Special attention is also given to study how the wear evolution is affected by the friction conditions between the wheel and rail.

40|$|The acting {{forces and}} {{resulting}} material degradation at the running surfaces of wheels and rail {{are determined by}} vehicle, track, interface and operational characteristics. To effectively manage the experienced wear, plastic deformation and crack development at wheels and rail, the interaction between vehicle and track demands a system approach both in maintenance and in design. This requires insight into the impact of train operational parameters on rail- and wheel degradation, in particular at switches and crossings due to the complex dynamic behaviour of a railway vehicle at a turnout. A parametric study {{was carried out by}} means of vehicle-track simulations within the VAMPIRE® multibody simulation software, performing a sensitivity analysis regarding operational factors and their impact on expected switch panel wear loading. Additionally, theoretical concepts were cross-checked with operational practices by means of a case study in response to a dramatic change in lateral rail wear development at specific switches in Dutch track. Data from train operation, track maintenance and track inspection were analysed, providing further insight into the operational dependencies. From the simulations performed in this study, it was found that switch rail lateral wear loading at the diverging route of a 1 : 9 type turnout is significantly influenced by the level of wheel–rail friction {{and to a lesser extent}} by the direction of travel (facing or trailing). The influence of other investigated parameters, being vehicle speed, traction, gauge widening and track layout is found to be small. Findings from the case study further confirm the simulation outcome. This research clearly demonstrates the contribution <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> can have in preventing abnormal lateral wear at locations where the wheel–rail interface is heavily loaded. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{conduct a}} {{research}} and find out the causes of defects appearing on the wheel thread of freight locomotives 2 М 62 and SIEMENS ER 20 CF. Methodology. To find the ways {{to solve this problem}} comparing the locomotive designs and their operating conditions. Findings. After examining the nature of the wheel wear the main difference was found: in locomotives of the 2 M 62 line wears the wheel flange, and in the locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF – the tread surface. After installation on the 2 M 62 locomotive the <b>lubrication</b> system of <b>flanges</b> their wear rate significantly decreased. On the new freight locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF the <b>flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems of the wheel set have been already installed at the factory, however the wheel thread is wearing. As for locomotives 2 M 62, and on locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF most wear profile skating wheels of the first wheel set. On both locomotive lines the 2 М 62 and the SIEMENS ER 20 CF the tread profile of the first wheel set most of all is subject to the wear. After reaching the 170 000 km run, the tread surface of some wheels begins to crumble. There was a suspicion that the reason for crumb formation of the wheel surface may be insufficient or excessive wheel hardness or its chemical composition. In order to confirm or deny this suspicion the following studies were conducted: the examination of the rim surface, the study of the wheel metal hardness and the document analysis of the wheel production and their comparison with the results of wheel hardness measurement. Practical value. The technical condition of locomotives is one of the bases of safety and reliability of the rolling stock. The reduction of the wheel wear significantly reduces the operating costs of railway transport. After study completion it was found that there was no evidence to suggest that the ratio of the wheel-rail hardness could be the cause of the wheel surface crumbling...|$|R

40|$|Rail {{and rail}} wheel flange wear {{on the rail}} track {{has been a problem}} of {{attention}} for the last 30 years. The problems arise in curves and depend on increased traffic volume, heavier axle load and also higher speed. Axle loads of 22, 5 - 25 ton is common nowadays and the trend is towards heavier axle loads where the next step is 30 - 35 ton. Flange wear includes both wheel and rail flanges and is therefore a problem for the operating company as well as the infrastructure owner. The flange wear depend mainly on the number of passed axles, type of traffic, speed and curve radius but also the axle load contributes. <b>Flange</b> <b>lubrication</b> on high rail is a well known way to reduce wear since the middle of 70 th and a number of techniques to lubricate the rail flange are developed as grease, aerosol of oil and dry stick with solid lubricants. The trackside lubricator can not apply the grease on the rail flange when the climate is during the winter. The infrastructure owner in Sweden was interested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the track side lubricator. The investment in trackside lubricators over 20 years was about 75 Mkr (7, 6 USD) and also an additional yearly costs to operate 3000 apparatuses. The work to evaluate effectiveness of the lubrication started 1997 there one of the important matter concern the possibility to use environmentally adapted lubricants without hazard the rail. This licentiate thesis concern effectiveness of trackside lubricators to reduce wear in sharp railroad curves. Also the environmentally aspects have been considered and therefore natural esters synthetic esters and additives suited for those kind of lubricants have been evaluated. The research proved that environmentally adapted lubricants could lubricate as good as earlier used greases. Some amount of metal removal is probably healthy for this kind of application. Lubricants as synthetic esters can be designed get those qualities. It was also found significant difference between the seasons concerning flange wear. This difference depends on the problem to apply grease on the rail flange during the winter...|$|R
