5|$|Eragon is {{the first}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second year {{rewriting}} and fleshing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish Eragon; Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. By chance, the book was discovered by Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing Timelash, Tat Wood {{described}} it as [...] "a grindingly dull story only memorable for being made as a school panto with belated New Romantic 80s fashion errors". Wood singled <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>storys</b> script, production and costumes for particular criticism.|$|R

5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Derviš Korkut, who saved {{the book from}} the Nazis, was told in an article by Geraldine Brooks in The New Yorker magazine. The article also sets <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the young Jewish girl, Mira Papo, whom Korkut and his wife hid from the Nazis as they were acting to save the Haggadah. In a twist of fate, as an elderly woman in Israel, Mira Papo secured the safety of Korkut's {{daughter}} during the Bosnian war in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During the telling of the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E

60|$|Gwen {{made the}} little ones comfortable, and they were off in five minutes. The others kept up bravely till nine o'clock, then the bits of candles were burnt <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> all told, nuts and apples had lost their charm, and weariness and hunger caused spirits to fail perceptibly.|$|R
50|$|In Hammond, New York, in {{the early}} 1950s, a young girl named Iris Courtney and her black friend Jinx Fairchild are united by a murder that they commit in self-defense. From this central moment, this novel weaves <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of two {{families}} that intercross across divisions of race and class.|$|R
25|$|Homeschooled by his parents, Christopher Paolini {{graduated}} from high school at the age of fifteen, but felt he was not yet mature enough for college, so he wrote Eragon in his spare time. After writing the first draft for a year, he spent a second year rewriting it and fleshing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and characters, and then presented it to his parents. They had it self-published by the family publishing company, Paolini International, and Paolini then travelled to various schools advertising his novel. In 2002, author Carl Hiaasen discovered the book while his stepson was reading it, and brought it to the attention of his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. It was republished by Knopf in 2003.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Project #9 {{was brought}} back to the table, after {{catching}} the interest of Michael Bennett, then {{in the midst of his}} success with A Chorus Line. Ralph and Devine returned, and Bennett had Eyen, who was to direct, begin workshopping Big Dreams, as the musical was now known. Joining the cast at this time were Ben Harney, Obba Babatunde, Cleavant Derricks, and twenty-year-old gospel singer Jennifer Holliday as Carter's replacement (after Carter accepted an offer from NBC to star in Gimme a Break). However, Holliday left the project during the workshopping phase, as she disliked the material and was upset that her character, Effie White, died at the conclusion of the first act. Eyen, Bennett, and Krieger continued to iron <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and songs. Cheryl Gaines and Phyllis Hyman were both considered as replacements for Holliday.|$|E
25|$|After {{the merger}} between Square and Enix in 2003, many rookie staff members {{had to be}} trained and there were more new {{platforms}} to develop for {{with the release of}} the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Toriyama decided to assemble and direct a team of scenario writers and joined various game projects. He later collaborated with Final Fantasy X main programmer Koji Sugimoto and supervisor Yoshinori Kitase to create a Final Fantasy VII tech demo for the PlayStation 3. Development of this took around 6 weeks. During the first year after the development start of Final Fantasy XIII in April 2004, Toriyama thought up a story premised on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology created by Kazushige Nojima. In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together and lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team, Toriyama showed him a rough outline of what he had written and asked him to flesh <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and to correct how everything would connect.|$|E

5000|$|The novel also {{received}} the following praise from The Hamilton Spectator: “Glory Days explores real issues facing young adults without ever {{taking on a}} preachy, parental tone [...] [...] [...]Chan never settles for <b>the</b> easy, perfect <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> are intricate, as is life, and the characters are flawed, as are all of us.” ...|$|R
25|$|Though Broadchurch {{was first}} {{conceived}} of in 2003, creator and writer Chris Chibnall first began fleshing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and writing scripts {{for the first}} episodes in 2011. He approached ITV in autumn 2011 with the series, and the network quickly approved it for production. The role of Reverend Paul Coates was written for Arthur Darvill, and leads David Tennant and Olivia Colman were the first cast. Other roles were cast using auditions. Principal photography began on 13 August 2012 in Dorset. Most scenes were shot on location, {{with the majority of}} filming in and around Clevedon and West Bay. Soundstages were used for some interior scenes. Dialogue rarely departed from the scripts, but other aspects of the performances were improvised. A documentary visual style and an emphasis on first takes were used to heighten the realism of the series and acting. Few of the crew and none of the actors knew the identity of the murderer when filming began. A number of steps were taken to maintain this secret. Only those cast and crew with an absolute need to know were told the identity of the murderer once filming began on the final three episodes.|$|E
500|$|Variety also singled <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> line {{as well as}} the cast, stating [...] "the danger sign is in {{the story}} and cast. Substitute Alice Brady for Helen Broderick and it's the same lineup of players as was in The Gay Divorcée. Besides which the {{situations}} in the two scripts parallel each other closely". Nevertheless, it concluded that Top Hat was a film [...] "one can't miss".|$|E
500|$|The iceberg {{theory has}} been termed the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway {{believed}} a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different. In [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>story</b> is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break.|$|E

500|$|... "The Rain King" [...] was {{the first}} episode written by new X-Files writer Jeffrey Bell. Bell, who never {{intended}} to work in television, sent the production staff three script ideas {{because he was a}} fan of the show. The staff agreed to buy one—which eventually became [...] "The Rain King"—as a freelance script. Bell worked with Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban, and Vince Gilligan to edit the script by [...] "boarding" [...] it, a process where note cards are used to flesh <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The group of men pitched the story idea to series creator Chris Carter in August, and Bell was later hired as a show writer.|$|E
500|$|The body of [...] "Major Martin" [...] {{was found}} at around 9:30am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge. Haselden, as Vice-Consul, was officially {{informed}} by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found. A series of pre-scripted diplomatic cables were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days. The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were encrypted, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the writers}} {{developed}} two potential plotlines for the episode: {{one in which}} Clark and Lana would get married, and another in which one of Clark's parents would die. The producers eventually chose only to kill one of the parents. The producers also debated the idea of other characters dying, but realized that none would have as much resonance as one of Clark's parents. Once the basic plot was decided, a group of Smallville writers used whiteboards to flesh <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> and the details were arranged. After the main story line was developed, the supervising producers presented it to several of the executive vice presidents at The WB Television Network. The executives enjoyed the story: Michael Roberts, a senior executive, called the episode's plot [...] "great" [...] and noted that [...] "the conceit is really cool".|$|E
50|$|Writer/artist John Stanley's {{work on the}} Little Lulu {{comic book}} is highly regarded. He did the initial Lulu comics, later working with artists Irving Tripp and Charles Hedinger (Tripp inking Hedinger before {{eventually}} assuming both duties), writing and laying <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> He continued working on the comic until around 1959. Stanley {{is responsible for the}} many additional characters in <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> After Stanley, other writers produced <b>the</b> Lulu <b>stories</b> for Gold Key Comics, including Arnold Drake.|$|R
50|$|Our own {{reactions}} are questioned, because, after all, {{what is it}} in us that makes us seek <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of another's grief? Or, even more problematically, what makes us follow <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of <b>the</b> torturers? We follow Ubu's history, are drawn into his family drama, are confronted with his logics of self-justification. We as audience are also implicated because we laugh at his sometimes absurd antics, and this very laughter accuses us.|$|R

500|$|Writer Brannon Braga {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the episode as centered on Captain Picard, rather than Worf. It was only when planning <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> that he realised that {{there would not be}} a great deal of personal differences across realities with Picard. As such, he decided to include Worf as the main character, and chose to place him in a romance with Troi as he felt that most people would not have expected it. Braga considered writing Tasha Yar into the episode, but he felt that this would have copied [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", so he replaced her with Wesley Crusher, played by Wil Wheaton. Further changes were made to the script as Braga had intended for Worf to be sung [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in the Klingon language, but the cost for the rights to the song would have been prohibitive and so the idea was dropped.|$|E
500|$|While Chahi had a {{clear idea}} of how to {{implement}} his game engine, he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game, allowing the game to develop [...] "layer by layer without knowing where it was going." [...] He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to Karateka and Impossible Mission. Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game. Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through GFA BASIC coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.|$|E
500|$|Koechlin {{also worked}} in Rajat Kapoor's What's Done, Is Done, an {{adaptation}} of Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth. She played Lady Macbeth and doubled up {{as one of the}} witches for the play. The first show of the play was staged on 5 June 2016 in Mumbai. Koechlin's other stage appearances include Atul Kumar's Trivial Disasters, The Real Inspector Hound, Ajay Krishnan's Hair, where she plays Rapunzel, and Kapoor's Hamlet, The Clown Prince. In 2015, she made her directorial debut on stage with a play entitled Living Room. Development of the play began in 2014, when Koechlin wrote a four-page conversation between Death and an old woman who is in a strange surreal space, about to die but unwilling to exit the world. She further worked on the script of the play in 2015. In a 2016 interview with Mumbai Mirror she said, [...] "Last year, when I was unemployed for six months, I started fleshing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> It turned into a comedy on life and death". The play was staged at the Ranga Shankara Hall, Bangalore, on 24 July 2015.|$|E
