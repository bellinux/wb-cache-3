25|$|Locking pliers, Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an <b>over-center</b> action. One side of the handle {{includes}} a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first locking pliers with a locking handle that Petersen called the Vise-Grip was patented.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major types of fasteners: cam, <b>over-center,</b> and ratchet.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of <b>over-center</b> mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful <b>over-center</b> characteristic.|$|E
50|$|For the 1965 model year, Wheel Horse Products, Inc., of South Bend, Indiana, USA, {{introduced}} the first garden tractors {{equipped with an}} hydraulic CVT. The models 875 and 1075 included an Eaton-manufactured variable-displacement swash-plate pump and fixed-displacement gear-type hydraulic motor combined into a single compact package, which attached directly to the patented Wheel Horse Unidrive™ transaxle. Reverse was produced by reversing {{the flow of the}} pump through <b>over-centering</b> of the swash plate. Acceleration was limited and smoothed through use of pressure accumulator and relief valves located between the pump and motor, to prevent the sudden changes in speed possible with a direct hydraulic coupling. Subsequent versions included fixed swash plate motors, and ball pumps and were sourced from both Eaton and Sundstrand Corp.|$|R
5000|$|An {{even more}} common {{example of an}} <b>over-center</b> device is an {{ordinary}} electric wall switch. These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off" [...] position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.|$|E
50|$|Mercury {{switches}} {{were once}} common in bimetal thermostats. The {{weight of the}} movable mercury drop provided some hysteresis by a degree of <b>over-center</b> action. The bimetal spring had to move further to overcome {{the weight of the}} mercury, tending to hold it in the open or closed position. The mercury also provided positive on-off switching, and could withstand millions of cycles without contact degradation.|$|E
50|$|In one mechanism, two {{opposing}} coils with an <b>over-center</b> spring or permanent magnet hold the contacts in position after the coil is de-energized. A pulse to one coil turns the relay on and a pulse {{to the opposite}} coil turns the relay off. This type is widely used where control is from simple switches or single-ended outputs of a control system, and such relays are found in avionics and numerous industrial applications.|$|E
5000|$|Counterbalance valves, {{also called}} load holding valves or <b>over-center</b> valves, serve as {{hydraulic}} {{resistance to the}} actuating cylinder when the load weight is required {{to be held in}} position for a period of time. These come in two distinct configurations, both highly effective in improving load handling safety during a loss of hydraulic pressure: essentially locking the lift/dump cylinder in-place, preventing potential free fall of the load in the event of hydraulic failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Over-center</b> {{fasteners}} {{require a}} slightly more complex threading procedure to start the webbing through the fastener. The tensioning method provided by this fastener makes it easier than the cam fastener to get more tension into the strap and to keep it there. When the fastener is “open” you can feed the excess webbing through the fastener. When all of the slack is removed, the act of “closing” the fastener will add tension to the webbing and hold the tension tightly in place.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke {{introduced}} the buckle boot, using <b>over-center</b> levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across {{a number of}} eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering {{the front of the}} boot.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Atkinson [...] "Cycle Engine"== The next engine {{designed}} by Atkinson in 1887 {{was named the}} [...] "Cycle Engine" [...] This engine used poppet valves, a cam and an <b>over-center</b> arm to produce four piston strokes for every revolution of the crankshaft. The intake and compression strokes were significantly shorter than the expansion and exhaust strokes. The [...] "Cycle" [...] engines were produced and sold for several years by the British Engine Company. Atkinson also licensed production to other manufacturers. Sizes ranged from a few up to 100 horsepower.|$|E
5000|$|Locking pliers, mole grips (mole wrench) or vise-grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an <b>over-center</b> action. One side of the handle {{includes}} a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle (especially in larger models) often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. [...] "Mole" [...] and [...] "Vise-Grip" [...] are trade names of different brands of locking pliers, yet locking pliers are generically referred to as [...] "Vise-Grips" [...] by mechanics and do-it-yourself hobbyists and craftspeople.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of buckles found in tie down straps. The two most common are {{threaded}} buckles and snap buckles. Threaded buckles work like those found on backpacks and duffel bags {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of the tie down strap. Snap buckles are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading buckle providing tension and the snap buckle providing fastening. While threading buckles come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like <b>over-center</b> and ratchet fasteners, snap buckles are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|E
50|$|The {{probe head}} {{located in the}} CSM was {{self-centering}} and gimbal-mounted to the probe piston. As the probe head engaged in {{the opening of the}} drogue socket, three spring-loaded latches depressed and engaged. These latches allowed a so-called 'soft dock' state and enabled the pitch and yaw movements in the two vehicles to subside. Excess movement in the vehicles during the 'hard dock' process could cause damage to the docking ring and put stress on the upper tunnel. A depressed locking trigger link at each latch allowed a spring-loaded spool to move forward, maintaining the toggle linkage in an <b>over-center</b> locked position. In {{the upper end of the}} Lunar Module tunnel, the drogue, which was constructed of 1-inch-thick aluminum honeycomb core, bonded front and back to aluminum face sheets, was the receiving end of the probe head capture latches.|$|E
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an <b>over-center</b> arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E
5000|$|More technically, [...] "suicide clutch" [...] {{can refer}} to clutch {{controls}} lacking a detent on the foot clutch, which would otherwise allow the rider to lock the clutch in the disengaged position. Early foot-clutch motorcycles, such as those from Harley-Davidson and Indian, allowed the rider to lock the clutch foot pedal due to its <b>over-center</b> geometry plus a helper spring (aka [...] "sissy spring"), so they could place both {{feet on the ground}} when stopped. These standard clutches are called a [...] "rocker clutch". If this device was disabled, or a custom foot clutch was installed that had no detent, it was referred to as a [...] "suicide clutch" [...] because stopping the motorcycle in-gear required the rider to keep his foot on the pedal. Should he lose his balance and put the left foot down, the motorcycle could lurch forward into cross traffic. The suicide clutch, especially on a chopper with no front brake, also made stopping at a red light on a hill especially precarious.|$|E
50|$|The White Knight carrier {{airplane}} {{was designed}} around the twin afterburning J-85 engines, which {{were selected for}} their availability and low cost. The aircraft was a completely new independent design. White Knight and SpaceShipOne shared the same forward fuselage outer mold line (OML) to reduce development costs and with the original intent to allow for White Knight {{to act as a}} flying simulator for training SpaceShipOne pilots. White Knight first flew on August 1, 2002. The flight was aborted shortly after takeoff due to a problem with the outboard wing spoilers. These trailing edge spoilers were designed to greatly increase the glide slope so that the White Knight vehicle could act as a flying simulator for training of SpaceShipOne pilots. During the first flight, the mechanical <b>over-center</b> torque was insufficient to maintain the spoilers in the closed position. The spoilers deployed into the free stream and began a limit cycle forcing the pilot (Mike Melvill) to abort. The spoilers were subsequently disabled completely and the desire for a steep glide slope matching SpaceShipOne was abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Atkinson {{produced}} {{three different}} designs {{that had a}} short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The first Atkinson-cycle engine, the differential engine, used opposed pistons. The second and most well-known design, was the cycle engine, which used an <b>over-center</b> arm to create four piston strokes in one crankshaft revolution. The reciprocating engine had the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle in a single turn of the crankshaft, and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines. Atkinson's third and final engine, the utilite engine, operated much like any two-stroke engine. The common thread throughout Atkinson's designs is that the engines have an expansion stroke that is longer than the compression stroke, and by this method the engine achieves greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. Atkinson's engines were produced by the British Gas Engine Company and also licensed to other overseas manufacturers. Many modern engines now use unconventional valve timing to produce {{the effect of a}} shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, Miller applied this technique to the four-stroke engine, so it is sometimes referred as the Atkinson/Miller cycle, US patent 2817322 dated Dec 24, 1957. In 1888, Charon filed a French patent and displayed an engine at the Paris Exhibition in 1889. The Charon gas engine (four- stroke) used a similar cycle to Miller, but without a supercharger. It {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Charon cycle" [...] Modern engine designers are realizing the potential fuel-efficiency improvements the Atkinson-type cycle can provide.|$|E
5000|$|The suicide clutch is {{sometimes}} incorrectly called a suicide shifter. The suicide clutch is a foot-operated clutch that {{is mounted on}} the left side of the motorcycle's forward foot controls. The suicide-clutch moniker has derived from difficulties in operating this form of clutch and shifter. On a motorcycle equipped with a conventional hand clutch and foot shifter, the rider places the left foot on the ground when stopped and holds the motorcycle in place with pressure on the rear brake pedal with the right foot, while engaging the clutch with the left hand. On a motorcycle equipped with a suicide clutch, the clutch is held in with the left foot, requiring the right foot to hold the bike in place, with the right hand applying pressure to the front brake. Early Harley Davidson foot clutches used an <b>over-center</b> spring to hold the clutch pedal in the disengaged position and used a friction disc to allow the rider to adjust the sensitivity of the return. Often riders removed the spring to keep the clutch pedal from returning to the disengaged position while riding. While this spring removal allowed for the clutch to stay engaged better, it also removed the safety feature of the clutch pedal holding itself in the disengaged position. With the pedal not returning to its natural disengaged position, the rider must either shift into neutral or hold the clutch pedal with the left foot when coming to a stop. Early Harley Davidson racers removed the clutch return spring to ensure the clutch stayed in the engaged position throughout the race. This practice soon caught on with other riders. The term [...] "suicide clutch" [...] was coined by those who could not operate the foot clutch proficiently enough to ride a tank shift (or hand shift) motorcycle in normal traffic.|$|E
5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an <b>over-center</b> spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Aircraft and the definitive published version is available at [URL] {{key part of the}} main landing gear (MLG) of a civil aircraft is its locking mechanism that holds the gear in the deployed or down-locked state. The locking is driven by a spring mechanism and its release by the unlock actuator. This paper considers this mechanism in terms of its stability and the locking and unlocking forces required for down-locking. To study this an analytical model was developed. The equations, consisting of geometric constraints and force/moment equilibriums, were derived using the coordinate transformation method. Using numerical continuation to solve these equations, the effect of the unlock force on the MLG retraction cycle was analyzed. The variation of a fold bifurcation point, which indicates the transition between the locked state and the unlocked state, gives further insight into the required unlock force that governs the sizing of the unlock actuator. Moreover, some important information, such as the critical position for the lock-links’ stops, the unlock position and the unlock force, are discussed using the bifurcation diagrams for the MLG retraction/extension cycle. Then, the effect of three key geometry parameters of the locking spring (the spring stiffness, unstrained spring length and spring attachment point) on the critical <b>over-center</b> angle and the unlock force are investigated. Finally, an optimization of the critical unlock force is carried out with a constraint on the initial <b>over-center</b> angle. The results show that the spring parameters have significant effects on the MLG’s retraction performance. A 37 % reduction of the required unlock force is obtained through optimizing for the gear considered here...|$|E

40|$|A Seat Track Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a seat track, then actuating a locking lever to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an <b>over-center</b> locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a seat track, without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|E

40|$|Topology {{optimisation}} has for {{a considerable}} time been applied successfully in the automotive industry, but still has not commonly become a mainstream technology in the aerospace industry. The aircraft manufactures have already been achieving benefits with optimisation for some areas where as the bottom layer suppliers in the aerospace industry are still following conventional design techniques. Most of metal fittings which are widely used in the aerospace industry with safety nets and straps are identified as bulky and heavy as {{they are based on}} conventional designing techniques. 5000 lb <b>over-center</b> buckle (OCB) {{is one of the most}} frequently used tightening devices having the aforementioned characteristics. The purpose of this study is to formulate a mechanism for a strength-based weight reduction on standard 5000 lb OCB which is used in the aerospace industry and consequently, to propose a light-weight design. First objective was to identify the relevant design considerations of existing 5000 lb OCB. Design specifications and standards related to 5000 lb OCB and 5000 lb safety strap were collected and reviewed for collecting necessary strength, functionality and other requirements of 5000 lb OCB. Second objective was to develop a finite element methodology for static structural analysis of 5000 lb OCB. 5000 lb OCB samples were carefully examined to identify the functionality and other necessary requirements of the OCB. OCBs were then subjected to a detail measurement check and the dimensions were used to build a computer aided design (CAD) model for the study. Engineering drawings were also created from the model for future reference. Then OCB samples with polyester webbing parts were subjected to various kind of strength tests using tensile testing machine. Purposes of these tests were to identify the failure loads and failure modes of the OCB itself and the OCB with safety strap in the operational conditions. These experimental results showed that the 5000 lb OCB used in the aerospace industry is an over-design. Last objective was to optimise the 5000 lb OCB using an effective optimisation scheme. Having reviewed on optimisation procedures and current trends in the aerospace industry, Altair HyperMesh software was selected as the numerical simulation tool to setup the finite element model and ‘Topology Optimisation’ was selected as optimisation method for the study. The finite element model was validated using simulation results and experimental results and the validated methodology was used to setup optimisation problem with aim of reducing weight. In formulating the topology optimisation problem, the minimum averaged compliance of the buckle was taken as the objective, and element density was used as the design variable. Topology optimisation results were analysed and the elements in the critical regions were derived as geometries to compare those with original OCB model. Considering other functionality requirements with the topology optimisation results, a light-weight design was proposed with step-by-step modifications. Subsequently, FE simulations were repeated for the proposed light-weight design. Comparing the results of the light-weight design with the original model results, the proposed light-weight design can be noted as a better alternative. Nearly 7 % (41 g) weight reduction could be achieved for 5000 lb OCB using the proposed optimisation procedure...|$|E
