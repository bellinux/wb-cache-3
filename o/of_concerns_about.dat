An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> enough food and its association with other sociodemographic and health characteristics at the state level. METHODS: Adult respondents participating in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey provided information on <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> enough food from nine states from 1996 through 1999. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> enough food ranged from 3. 1 % to 11. 8 % for individual states. Across states, low household income was the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> enough food. The odds <b>of</b> being <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> enough food were generally higher among respondents who were female, younger, and without health care coverage.

5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige {{had been}} a royal clerk prior to his {{appointment}} to York in 1051, although the monks of Peterborough Abbey maintained that he {{had been a}} monk in their house. It is possible he was both a monk and a royal clerk. He delayed his visit to Rome to receive his pallium until 1055, when he was given it by Pope Victor II. During his time as archbishop he was claimed to have consecrated both John and Magsuen as Bishops of Glasgow, although the two bishops probably never lived in their diocese. John may have ended up as the Bishop of Mecklenburg in Germany. Cynesige dedicated the church of the Abbey of Waltham Holy Cross in the presence of King Edward the Confessor around 3 May 1060. This was at the invitation of Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex. The chronicle of Waltham Abbey states that Cynesige did the consecration because the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant. However, there was an occupant of Canterbury, Stigand, but his election to Canterbury was not considered canonical by the papacy, and Harold may have excluded him because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> Stigand's canonical status.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, the 27th Brigade {{was sent}} to Malaya to {{reinforce}} the 22nd, which had been serving there in a garrison role since February, having been dispatched while the 2/4th Machine Battalion had been forming. With this, the only 2nd AIF troops remaining in Australia were those of the 23rd Brigade. As a result <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> Japanese intentions in the region, {{the decision was made}} to move the brigade north to bolster the defences around Darwin in the Northern Territory. In the event of fighting in the Pacific, the government planned to split infantry battalions, to defend the island chain to Australia's north, dispatching forces to Rabaul, Ambon and Timor. The role of the corps troops from the 2/4th Pioneers and 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion remained uncertain. The 8th Division's commander, Major General Gordon Bennett, unhappy with the dispersal of his command, had been agitating for the dispatch of the machine gunners to Malaya to support his two infantry brigades, arguing that they would be valuable for beach defence. Bennett's request had been rejected initially in March, due to the limited numbers of recruits enlisting but by mid-September, elements at Army headquarters in Melbourne had also begun to advocate for it. In early October, following a War Cabinet decision to split the command of the 8th Division in two, removing the elements in Australia from Bennett's command, the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion received orders to move north to Darwin, where it was to serve in a home defence role in case of a Japanese attack.|$|E

5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and {{a separation of}} powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most {{human and animal}} herpesviruses, the trunk secretions may {{be a source of}} transmission for EEHVs. Because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the Japanese {{model of}} Lesson Study was {{introduced}} {{as a teacher}} professional development programme to nine low-performing primary schools in Malaysia. The objectives {{of this study were}} to examine to what extent Lesson Study can improve low-performing primary mathematics and science teachers' stages <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the implementation <b>of</b> Lesson Study in their schools and their teaching quality as well as student learning performance. The sample consisted of 97 primary mathematics and science teachers from three types of primary schools: the National School (SK); the National Type Chinese School (SJKC) and the National Type Tamil School (SJKT). Before the implementation of Lesson Study, a workshop was conducted in every school to introduce participating teachers to the concepts of Lesson Study and the research procedure. After the workshop, the participating teachers were asked to complete the Stages <b>of</b> <b>Concern</b> Questionnaire (SoCQ) in order to identify their initial stages <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the implementation <b>of</b> Lesson Study in their schools. The SoCQ was developed based on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM). It consists of 35 items, categorising teachers' concerns into seven stages: Stage 0 (Awareness); Stage 1 (Informational); Stage 2 (Personal); Stage 3 (Management); Stage 4 (Consequence); Stage 5 (Collaboration) and Stage 6 (Refocusing) (George, Hall & Stiegelbauer, Measuring implementation in schools: The stages <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> questionnaire (2006)). The same SoCQ was also given to the participating teachers after every Lesson Study cycle to determine whether their stages <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> changed before and after the implementation of Lesson Study cycles. In this paper, only the data collected from the first SoCQ given were analysed. The results showed that the profiles of the SK, SJKC and SJKT teachers' initial stages <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the implementation <b>of</b> Lesson Study in their schools were quite similar. The SK, SJKC and SJKT teachers' concerns were the highest in Stage 0 and the lowest in Stage 4, indicating that these teachers had a high level <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> a number <b>of</b> other initiatives, tasks, and activities besides Lesson Study and they had quite a low level <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the consequences <b>of</b> implementing Lesson Study for their students, respectivel...|$|R
