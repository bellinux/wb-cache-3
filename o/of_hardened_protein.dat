25|$|Arthropods (class Athropoda) {{are covered}} with a tough, {{resilient}} integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or <b>hardened</b> <b>proteins.</b> This happens {{in parts of the}} body where {{there is a need for}} rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various <b>proteins</b> <b>hardened</b> by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the <b>hardened</b> <b>proteins</b> are called sclerotin.|$|R

The effect <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening</b> on the contact behaviour of a non-adhesive frictionless elastic-plastic contact is analyzed using commercial finite element software ANSYS. To study the strain hardening effect we have taken different values of tangent modulus. The result <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening</b> effect clearly shows that a generalized solution can not be applicable for all kind of materials as the effect <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening</b> differently influenced the contact parameters.

For higher value <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> parameter the effect <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening</b> is severe on contact parameters. With the increase in strain hardening the resistance to deformation of a material is increased and the material becomes capable of carrying higher amount of load in a smaller contact area. I...|$|R

40|$|High-protein snack bars (protein bars) contain {{high-quality}} protein, sugars {{and other}} {{low molecular weight}} polyhydroxy compounds (PHCs), high-energy confectionary fats, and a minimum of water (water activity ≤ 0. 65). The consequence of the intimate mixing of these components in protein bars {{is that they can}} react together, creating sensory characteristics that are unacceptable to consumers. This study examined the changes occurring in a model protein bar during storage for 50 days at 20 °C. Over this time, fracture stress increased from 20. 1 +/- 1. 8 Pa to 201 +/- 75 Pa at a rate that decreased slightly over time. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased dramatically over the first 5 days as the batter set into a solid bar. Over the first 17 hours after manufacturing, protein particles became more clustered, and soluble protein appeared to precipitate, as shown by confocal microscopy. Reactive lysine fell 38 % in the first 10 days of storage and was approximately constant thereafter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed little change in protein molecular weights. Following the initial ‘setting’ phase of 5 - 10 days, fracture stress continued to increase and the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased. Changes in PHC molecular mobility were consistent with glucose crystallisation. Chemical changes were minimal during this phase, which suggests that chemical reactions play little part in the <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> bars and that changes in molecular mobility and changes in microstructure driven by moisture migration may be more important...|$|R
