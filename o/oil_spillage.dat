5|$|There were a {{few major}} {{accidents}} {{in the history of}} the MRT that raised safety concerns among the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an <b>oil</b> <b>spillage</b> on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the <b>oil</b> <b>spillage.</b> Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the <b>oil</b> <b>spillage.</b> The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ecological effects of mixed pollution in Eastern Obolo communities in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria. There have been several debates on {{the subject matter of}} the interaction of the people of the Niger Delta with the oil firms over the past few years. The core of the debate often, is the hazard of oil and gas pollution on the environment. This study attempted to find other possible contributory sources of the pollution problems in the area. Five variables were selected namely; household waste disposal, human bodily waste, <b>oil</b> <b>spillages,</b> gas flaring, seismic and dredging activities. A population of 301 subjects was selected from 13 towns and villages between January 2009 and January 2011, using the stratified random sampling. Structured questionnaires were used. The model for analysis was the multiple regression models of Aldrich (2005) and Fisher (1922). The study finds that the ecological pollution of Eastern Obolo is not only caused by the activities of the oil firms (that is, gas flaring, seismic activities, dredging, and <b>oil</b> <b>spillages)</b> but also caused by the contributory effects of human bodily waste including faeces and household waste that are unreasonably and routinely being dumped in the environment by the natives. The study concludes by recommending for the inclusion of the natives in environmental decisions and policy formulations...|$|R

Most industrial designs can never be made without taking into consideration the effect of corrosion on the life span of the equipment. Recent industrial catastrophes have it that many industries have lost several billions of dollars as a result of corrosion. Reports around the world have confirmed that some oil companies had their pipeline ruptured due to corrosion and that <b>oil</b> <b>spillages</b> are experienced which no doubt created environmental pollution; in addition, resources are lost in cleaning up this environmental mess, and finally, large-scale ecological damage resulted from corrosion effects [6]. The possibility of occurrence of corrosion in an industrial plant has been posing a lot of concern to petroleum, chemical, and mechanical engineers and chemists. It is now known that corrosion can have some effects on the chemistry of a chosen process, and the product of corrosion can affect reaction and purity of the reaction products.|$|R

50|$|Government {{encouragement}} in {{the form}} of subsidies and tax incentives for energy-conservation efforts has increasingly fostered the view of conservation as a major function of the energy industry: saving an amount of energy provides economic benefits almost identical to generating that same amount of energy. This is {{compounded by the fact that}} the economics of delivering energy tend to be priced for capacity as opposed to average usage. One of the purposes of a smart grid infrastructure is to smooth out demand so that capacity and demand curves align more closely.Some parts of the energy industry generate considerable pollution, including toxic and greenhouse gases from fuel combustion, nuclear waste from the generation of nuclear power, and <b>oil</b> <b>spillages</b> as a result of petroleum extraction. Government regulations to internalize these externalities form an increasing part of doing business, and the trading of carbon credits and pollution credits on the free market may also result in energy-saving and pollution-control measures becoming even more important to energy providers.|$|R
