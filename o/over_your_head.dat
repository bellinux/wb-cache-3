500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult. GamePro contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as [...] "pulling teeth, lifting a car <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> or performing open-heart surgery" [...] are all significantly easier than beating Mega Man 3. Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state}} of delicious near-panic as you wait to see what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills." [...] The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once. The writers mentioned that it detracted from the normally crisp graphics the few times it was noticed.|$|E
500|$|In her youth, Wintour {{was educated}} at the {{independent}} North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against {{the dress code}} by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing {{her hair in a}} bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from the United States. [...] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion," [...] she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.|$|E

[...] He then apologized to Colbert, in a {{conversation}} via satellite, for inadvertently smashing him {{over the head with}} a beer bottle during the brawl, amid the confusion. [...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and encouraged Conan to hit you with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the mass}} {{success of the}} band's self-titled album, author Dick Porter wrote that the {{anticipation}} for a follow up was intense. Prior to its release, drummer Jordison proclaimed: [...] "Wait till you hear our fuckin' next record. It smokes our first album. The shit's twice as technical, three times as heavy." [...] Iowa generally received favorable reviews from music critics. The College Music Journal reviewed it as [...] "brutal, unrelenting, scorching..." [...] Many reviews noted its heavy themes; Alternative Press stated, [...] " [...] like having a plastic bag taped <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag.... is over the top...you're {{going to be left}} in stitches." [...] NME said that it is [...] "Exhilarating, brutal and good." [...] Rolling Stone credited the album for its originality, stating that [...] "nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal." [...] Producer Robinson was also praised for his work on the album; Uncut noted, [...] "The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert." [...] Reviewing for Yahoo, John Mulvey said, [...] "They're an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reinforcement, a key {{concept of}} behaviorism, {{is the primary}} process that shapes and {{controls}} behavior, and occurs in two ways, [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "negative." [...] In The Behavior of Organisms (1938), Skinner defined [...] "negative reinforcement" [...] to be synonymous with punishment, that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in Science and Human Behavior (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> on a rainy day {{is reinforced by the}} cessation of rain falling on you).|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that. [...] But there's still a pretty big revelation there." ...|$|E
