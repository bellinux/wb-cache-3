5|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems {{of this type}} concern collections <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> need to be updated, such as the cells of a spreadsheet {{after one of the}} cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> can be easily divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> remain invariant even under deformation, properties {{such as their}} connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{contains}} non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables {{players to}} insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects {{can be placed}} and moved on maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time. A budget limits the amount <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> can be placed. Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie's official website, Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3.|$|E
25|$|The Amerindian {{collection}} includes Native North American art and Mesoamerican and Andean works. From pottery to textiles, {{the collection}} brings together {{a wide array}} <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> seek to illustrate the thematic and aesthetic focuses of art spanning the Americas.|$|E
25|$|The Sorolla Museum (Museo Sorolla) {{is located}} in the {{building}} in which the Valencian Impressionist painter had his home and workshop. The collection includes, in addition to numerous works by Joaquín Sorolla, a large number <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> the artist possessed, including sculptures by Auguste Rodin.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> sinks (is totally submerged), the volume <b>of</b> the <b>object</b> is {{displaced}}. In the case <b>of</b> an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> floats, {{the amount of}} fluid displaced will be equal in weight to the displacing object.|$|R
50|$|Many Native American languages, {{such as the}} extinct Atsugewi, do not select verbs {{of motion}} based on path or manner. Instead, verbs of motion are {{specific}} to the kind <b>of</b> <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is moving or being moved.|$|R
50|$|The lathe is {{so named}} because it {{produces}} the same type <b>of</b> <b>object</b> <b>that</b> a real lathe would produce: an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is symmetrical about an axis of rotation. However, unlike objects produced by a real lathe, the object can have an axis of rotation through a hole (e.g. a torus).|$|R
25|$|Chapter Two (seven mishnayot) {{deals with}} {{precautions}} against {{the violence and}} immorality of idolaters, and the items that are forbidden/permitted to be bought from idolaters. These include categories <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> may be by-products of idolatrous services, as well as foods with a difficult to identify kashrut status.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy is the {{technical}} field of using microscopes to view objects and areas <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> cannot {{be seen with}} the naked eye (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye). There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy.|$|E
25|$|A lathe is {{a machine}} tool which spins {{a block or}} {{cylinder}} of material so that when abrasive, cutting, or deformation tools are applied to the workpiece, it can be shaped to produce an object which has rotational symmetry about an axis of rotation. Examples <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> can be produced on a lathe include candlestick holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and bearing mounts.|$|E

25|$|Bjarne Stroustrup {{originally}} observed, in {{his book}} The Design and Evolution of C++, that pointer placement new is necessary for hardware that expects a certain object at a specific hardware address. It is also required for the construction <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> need to reside in a certain memory area, such as {{an area that is}} shared between several processors of a multiprocessor computer.|$|E
25|$|PD {{patients}} often demonstrate {{difficulty in}} updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not {{keep track of}} spatial contextual information {{in the same way}} that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, art {{photographer}} Christian Patterson released Redheaded Peckerwood, {{a collection}} of photos made each January from 2005 to 2010 along the 500-mile route traversed by Starkweather and Fugate. The book includes reproductions of documents and photographs <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> belonged to Starkweather, Fugate, and their victims, several of which Patterson discovered while making his photographs and had never been seen publicly before. Comic book series Northlanders referenced the story in its 2010 story arc Metal.|$|E

25|$|Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) — Austrian {{psychologist}} and philosopher, who wrote Gegenstandstheorie ("The theory of objects"), where he wrote {{at length about}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> exist only in our minds. He is referred to by his surname in the story; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the Northern Hemisphere of Tlön. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he {{got the idea for}} this imaginary family of languages.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|E
25|$|Raising the forelegs {{and holding}} the abdomen to one side {{are by no means}} {{specific}} to courtship. This display occurs to a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are approaching too close to the spider: other spiders - regardless of sex, houseflies or other large prey, models of prey that are {{about the size of the}} spider, such as 9–12mm spheres, or even the end of a finger or a pencil. In these situations, however, the spider with its forelegs raised and waving backs off while facing the moving object and, when 5–8cm away, turns away and flees.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit it, {{either directly or}} indirectly. <b>Of</b> those <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. <b>Of</b> the <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|R

25|$|Cubist {{sculpture}} {{developed in}} parallel with Cubist painting, beginning in Paris around 1909 with its proto-Cubist phase, and evolving through the early 1920s. Just as Cubist painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids; cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. Presenting fragments and facets <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> could be visually interpreted in different ways {{had the effect of}} 'revealing the structure' of the object. Cubist sculpture essentially is the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of non-Euclidean geometry by shifting viewpoints of volume or mass in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, finders <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are not {{treasure}} or {{treasure trove}} {{are encouraged to}} voluntarily report them under the Portable Antiquities Scheme to finds liaison officers at county councils and local museums. Under the scheme, which started in September 1997, the officers examine finds and provide finders with information on them. They also record the finds, their functions, dates, materials and locations, and place this information into a database which can be analysed. The information on the findspots {{may be used to}} organize further research on the areas. Non-treasure finds remain the property of their finders or landowners, who are free to dispose of them as they wish.|$|E
25|$|These two {{conditions}} imply convergence. All cooperating sites converge {{in a state}} {{in which there is}} a same set <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are in the same order. Moreover, the ordering is effectively determined by the effects of the operations when they are generated. Since the {{two conditions}} also impose additional constraints on object ordering, they are actually stronger than convergence. The CA model and the design/prove approach are elaborated in the 2005 paper. It no longer requires that a total order of objects be specified in the consistency model and maintained in the algorithm, which hence results in reduced time/space complexities in the algorithm.|$|E
