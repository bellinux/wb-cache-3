5|$|The style <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> writing, in {{this passage}} and {{throughout}} the piece, was alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing.

The piece employed techniques like scenes, dialogue and third-person narrative that were common in fiction, but still rare in journalism.|$|E

Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> and cinematic presentation.|$|E
5|$|Ebner has {{additionally}} written narrative fiction (novels, short stories, short prose), {{essays and}} poems. His poetry {{is written in}} German and Catalan. Supported by a subsidy for literature from the Austrian government, he went to Andorra in 2007 to write an essay about {{the country in the}} Pyrenees. He also translated the novel L'Absent written by the Catalan author Josep Navarro Santaeulàlia, into German. Ebner's cultural essays about Catalan culture, such as that of Barcelona and Andorra, have been published by the magazines Literatur und Kritik and Zitig. His first collection of short stories, Lose (Destinies), was published in 2007. Of its 45 stories, twenty-two had already been printed in newspapers, literary magazines or anthologies. In 2008, Ebner published two other books <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> fiction, among them the short novel Hominide.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> in British English conversation.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the various forces that have shaped the form, content, utilization and emergence <b>of</b> abortion <b>narratives</b> [...] both within a historical context and for political value. By comparing the themes that emerge within and across three sets <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> [...] anti-abortion narratives, pre-Roe narratives that support abortion rights, and post-Roe abortion-rights narratives [...] and by identifying both gaps and influxes in the use <b>of</b> <b>narratives,</b> this thesis argues that the content and utilization <b>of</b> abortion <b>narratives</b> is directly connected to broader discursive strategies and political ideologies of reproductive rights organizations...|$|R
5000|$|... {{also related}} to the {{sociology}} of stories approach {{that focuses on the}} contexts in which narratives are constructed. This approach attends to the [...] "embodied nature" [...] of the person telling the narrative, the context from which the narrative is created, the relationships between the narrative teller and others within the narrative, historical continuity, and the chronological organization of events. A story with a clear beginning, middle, and end is constructed from the narrative data. Polkinghorne makes the distinction between narrative analysis and analysis <b>of</b> <b>narratives.</b> Narrative analysis utilizes [...] "narrative reasoning" [...] by shaping data in a narrative form and doing an in-depth analysis <b>of</b> each <b>narrative</b> on its own, whereas analysis <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> utilizes paradigmatic reasoning and analyzes themes across data that take the form <b>of</b> <b>narratives.</b>|$|R
5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems {{concerning}} events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew who had gone to the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the found footage style <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E

In this paper the transcripts <b>of</b> audio-taped illness <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> six enrolled patients (three with righthemisphere lesions and three with left ones, matched by age and sex) were analyzed by means of two different methods: Semantic Networks Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

5|$|There {{is as yet}} no universally {{accepted}} diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the Attachment Q-sort and a variety <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> techniques using stem stories, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, {{it does not}} use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before the development of continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> by {{eighteen}} children 10 to 13 years old who live in an Algonquin community <b>of</b> Quebec. The <b>narratives,</b> primarily <b>of</b> children's personal experiences, were collected in peer groups, and were told in English, the children's second language. The specific contributions of children to each other's narratives were investigated and are described. The structural properties of a subset <b>of</b> the <b>narratives</b> were also examined using high point analysis (Peterson & McCabe, 1983). Findings resembled those reported for non-Aboriginal children {{with respect to the}} inclusion <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> elements <b>of</b> orientation, actions, and evaluation. However, the positioning of these elements and the low incidence of others resulted in differences in the structure <b>of</b> the <b>narratives.</b> Other aspects <b>of</b> the <b>narratives</b> considered include theme, narrator role, and the use of reported speech. The characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>narratives</b> are discussed as means by which the children in the study constructed and co-constructed narrative meaning. Information on the functional dimensions <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> in the community and on the sociocultural context in which the children live is also provided in order to facilitate the reader's appreciation of factors that influence children's narrative production...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the key elements}} of traditional and new emerging socio-linguistic approaches to the analysis <b>of</b> <b>narratives,</b> focusing speci?cally on narrative networks. It illustrates how a narrative networks approach examines narratives not only as texts, but also as representative of an array of social processes in their own contexts of production and consumption. The chapter ?rst reviews the main de?nitions <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> and illustrates traditional analytical perspectives,namely the componential and functional analyses. It then presents narrative net-works: its origins and theoretical principles. It outlines a step-by-step procedure for designing and analysing networks, showing how they can facilitate the critical analysis <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> as sociolinguistic manifestations...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> {{and stories}} {{has been growing}} in {{popularity}} in the field <b>of</b> knowledge management. <b>Narratives</b> {{may be used as}} useful vehicles for several knowledge-based activities within organisational (and other) contexts.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study <b>of</b> the 112 <b>narratives</b> {{collected from the}} Corpus Iuris Hibernici. The selection <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> is based on criteria informed by modern narratological theories. The significant presence <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> in early Irish law tracts appears {{at odds with the}} normal conception of law texts as consisting solely of provisions, and therefore needs to be accounted for. Since no systematic study has been conducted <b>of</b> these legal <b>narratives,</b> this thesis serves as an introduction by giving firstly an index <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> and secondly a categorisation of them in terms of distribution, dates and functions. It then carries out a general analysis of the relationship between legal narratives and early Irish literature, and a selected case study of the relationship between legal narratives and the legal institutions in the context <b>of</b> which the <b>narratives</b> are located. It has become clearer, with the progress of argument, that the use <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> {{was an integral part of}} legal writing in medieval Ireland; and the narratives, though having many idiosyncratic features of themselves, are profoundly connected with the learned tradition at large. The legal narratives reveal the intellectual background and compositional concerns of medieval Irish jurists, and they formed a crucial part of the effort to accommodate law tracts into the dynamic tradition of senchas. Two appendices are included at the end: one consists of translations <b>of</b> 34 <b>narratives</b> from the index, and the other is a critical edition of one <b>of</b> the <b>narratives</b> discussed in detail, together with translations of some relevant passages...|$|R
