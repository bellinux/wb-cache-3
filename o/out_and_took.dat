5|$|Miller {{then took}} 5/84 against Surrey, before leading the team against Warwickshire. He had {{received}} death threats in the lead-up to the game, ordering him to lose. He scored 46 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 2/13 as Australia won by an innings. He then took 5/29 {{in the second}} innings against Lancashire and made 50 and took match figures of 5/78 against Essex.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000–01 season, Pathan was {{immediately}} back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team.|$|E
5|$|Macartney struck form immediately, scoring 80 and 120 in {{the opening}} match against Wellington. He {{followed}} this with 100 (in a non-first-class match), 120 against Otago and 221 in the next match against Canterbury, all in consecutive innings. He added match figures of 4/38 as New South Wales defeated Canterbury by an innings. Macartney then scored 36 and 55 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> match figures of 4/55 in an eight-wicket win over New Zealand. He made only two and seven in the remaining first-class matches, and ended with 13 wickets at 20.92.|$|E

5|$|Tallon {{made his}} Test debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946, {{although}} the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of Bill O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack. Tallon made a stumping, a run <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During {{the tour of}} New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Ebsary was chosen in an Australian Under-23 team that played a two-innings match against the touring England team. Ebsary scored nine not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 4/35 and 0/4 from a total of 20 overs. She was {{somewhat}} more successful in the WNCL than in previous years, bowling 28 overs and taking five wickets at 17.00 at an economy rate of 3.03 with a best of 2/19 in the last match of the season with Victoria. She scored 91 runs at 15.16, her highest season aggregate and average to date, with a best of 26. This brought Ebsary's career average above 10 for the first time. South Australia won four of their matches and another was washed out, failing to make the final. She played in three matches for Australia Youth against New Zealand A {{at the end of the}} season, scoring 29 runs at 29.00 and taking three wickets at 16.66 at an economy rate of 4.54.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E

5|$|On {{his first}} {{overseas}} trip, McCabe struggled badly {{in his first}} four weeks in England. In six matches in that time, he scored only 51 runs at 7.28 and failed to take a wicket after being asked to bowl only 18 overs. After being dismissed {{in the last of}} these matches, McCabe came off the field and despondently said {{that he was going to}} retire. Teammate Clarrie Grimmett suggested that McCabe play with a fuller face of the bat, advice that the batsman accepted. McCabe's fortunes changed in the next match against Oxford University; he scored 91 and took 1/5 in an innings win. He added 65 in the next match against Hampshire and starred with both bat and ball against Cambridge University, the final tour match before the First Test. McCabe scored 96 before being run <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 4/25 and 4/60, which would remain his career best match bowling figures, as Australia completed a commanding innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1926–27, Kilner {{declined}} an invitation to tour India by the MCC. The 1927 season, which proved to be Kilner's last, was his least effective {{for several years and}} a disappointing summer for Yorkshire. The county fell to third in the Championship behind Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He failed to achieve a century, scoring 1,004 runs (average 33.46), and did not reach 100 wickets {{for the first time since}} 1921, taking just 86 wickets at an average of 23.68. Wisden said his bowling had lost its effectiveness and was no longer dangerous even when the pitch was helpful to spinners. In the Yorkshire averages, he finished fifth in both batting and bowling. In Kilner's final County Championship match, he scored 91 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> eight wickets, including five for 21 in the second innings, helping Yorkshire to a nine wicket victory. In his final first-class match, for Yorkshire against MCC, Kilner scored an unbeaten 51 to guide Yorkshire to an eight wicket win. He ended his first-class career with 14,707 runs at an average of 30.01 and 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45.|$|E
5|$|The Australian team {{joined the}} MCC cricketers {{on the journey}} to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some {{newspapers}} suggested Fender should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that Fender was overlooked. Fender began the season poorly and was not picked {{for the first three}} Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players {{in the course of the}} summer, many of whom critics did not consider to be of suitable quality. Fender began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. Fender scored 44 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; Fender retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a great deal from Warwick Armstrong's captaincy of the Australians.|$|E

5|$|The Third Test was Johnston's first Test {{in front}} of his home crowd of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, he scored his first runs at Test level, adding five before being run out. He removed both of India's openers, Chandu Sarwate and Mankad, and ended with 2/33 as Australia took a 103-run first innings lead. In the second innings, he did the same, bowling both players, and ended with 4/44 as Australia won by 233 runs. Johnston missed the Fourth Test in Adelaide due to injury but {{returned}} for the Fifth Test in Melbourne where he scored 23 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> match figures of 2/29 in another innings victory and Australia ended the summer with a 4–0 win. He headed the series averages with 16 wickets at 11.37. This ensured his selection for the 1948 tour of England as part of Bradman's Invincibles. However, Johnston was less successful outside the Tests, ending the summer with 20 wickets at 21.08.|$|E
25|$|He {{moved to}} Gisborne in 1909. In {{consecutive}} matches {{for the local}} Wanderers club in 1910-11, he scored 91 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 5 for 33 and 3 for 8 in an innings victory over YMCA, then scored 226 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 1 for 3 and 6 for 14 as Wanderers scored 551 for 2 declared to defeat Taruheru, who made 43 and 34, by an innings and 474 runs. In the local 1911-12 season, he scored 698 runs {{at an average of}} 349, his scores being: 30 not out, 2, 85 not out, 108 not out, 131 not out, 135 not out, 161 not out and 46. At {{the end of the season}} he made 122 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> five wickets when Gisborne's representative team, Poverty Bay, beat Hawke's Bay by 110 runs in their annual match. Wanderers won the Gisborne cricket competition for five years running, from 1909-10 to 1913-14.|$|E
