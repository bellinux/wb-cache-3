40|$|In corruption, a {{group of}} players gain an {{economic}} advantage without providing any socially beneficial services in return, therefore corruption {{is considered to be}} a form of rent-seeking. Similar to other forms of rent-seeking, corruption causes losses on a societal level, due to the less efficient allocation of resources, as well as the costs of operation and prosecution. Fighting corruption is important not just because of ethical but also economic considerations. Contributions from the European Union are making possible the use of more funds than ever, and spending the full amount of this money is a priority preference of the government. The abundance of funds and the pressure on absorption increase corruption, by the managers of the funds overplanning the amount of money to be allocated to individual tender invitations, setting generous rules on eligible costs, and specifying low rates of own contribution wherever possible. As a result, the opportunities for rent-seeking are increased, as it is worth it for beneficiaries to carry out the project even after relinquishing part of the funds they have been awarded. Thus, the abundance of funds generates a sphere of corruption in which rent-seekers may appear on various levels of the system, often even without the knowledge <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> on higher decisionmaking levels...|$|E
40|$|Feminist {{analyses}} largely {{consist of}} applying political, sociological, psychological, biological, and ethical analysis {{to the role}} of women in society. Just as individuals differ in their preferred political and ethical values, feminists differ in their analyses of women’s roles, their <b>approval</b> <b>or</b> disapproval <b>of</b> <b>those</b> roles, and their recommendations for changing those roles (I- 19). This diversity of views makes it impossible to state categorically that feminists as a group will approve or disapprove a particular application of a particular noncoital reproductive technique. Nevertheless, certain broad areas of agreement exist among most feminists (15), including the following: ● Women have been and are subordinated to men, a phenomenon rooted in women’s roles as childbearer...|$|R

To work the possibility of overlap between one area and another in educational affairs, we investigated the processes of subsidy granted by the state, between the years 1870 and 1880, the private schools of the Imperial Court in order to promote primary education for boys and girls in “extreme poverty”. We analyzed the procedures filed, the authorities concerned, the reasons that warranted <b>or</b> not, the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> grants, the amounts sought for payments and people who claimed them. Indeed, reflection allowed us to envisage a system of rules which the grant was part of and links {{between public and private}} benefits thereof...|$|R
