5|$|Exploration of salt domes {{across the}} plains of the Texas Gulf Coast took off with major oil fields opening at Sour Lake in 1902, Batson in 1903, Humble in 1905, and Goose Creek (modern Baytown) in 1908. Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious <b>offshore</b> <b>exploration</b> did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, {{for a total of}} 3.2 million acres.

25|$|Oil {{extraction}} {{is simply}} the removal of oil from the reservoir (oil pool). Oil is often recovered as a water-in-oil emulsion, and specialty chemicals called demulsifiers are used to separate the oil from water. Oil extraction is costly and sometimes environmentally damaging. <b>Offshore</b> <b>exploration</b> and extraction of oil disturbs the surrounding marine environment.|$|E

In 2001, Morocco granted exploration contracts to Total and Kerr-McGee, angering Premier Oil and Sterling Energy, which previously had obtained licenses from the Polisario government. In 2005, the government-in-exile of the Western Sahara invited foreign companies to bid on 12 contracts for <b>offshore</b> <b>exploration,</b> with hopes of awarding production sharing contracts {{by the end of}} 2005.|$|E

500|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>exploration</b> {{for natural}} gas began in 1970. The first major {{discovery}} was the Kinsale Head gas field in 1971. Next was the smaller Ballycotton gas field in 1989, and the Corrib gas field in 1996. Exploitation of the Corrib project has yet {{to get off the}} ground because the controversial proposal to refine the gas onshore, rather than at sea has been met with widespread opposition. Gas from these fields is pumped ashore and used for both domestic and industrial purposes. The Helvick oil field, estimated to contain over [...] of oil, is a 2000 discovery. Ireland is the largest European producer of zinc with three operating zinc-lead mines at Navan, Galmoy and Lisheen. Other mineral deposits with actual or potential commercial value include gold, silver, gypsum, talc, calcite, dolomite, roofing slate, limestone aggregate, building stone, sand and gravel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>exploration</b> and {{drilling}} {{were first}} {{undertaken in the}} early 1970s, and it became more widespread and advanced as the decade progressed. Chinese and foreign oil experts believed that offshore deposits were extensive and could equal onshore reserves. Offshore operations relied heavily on foreign technology. In 1982 thirty-three foreign oil companies submitted bids for offshore drilling rights; twenty-seven eventually signed contracts. By the mid-1980s, when <b>offshore</b> <b>exploration</b> results were disappointing and {{only a handful of}} wells were actually producing oil, China began to emphasize onshore development. To continue <b>offshore</b> <b>exploration,</b> China established the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to assist foreign oil companies in exploring, developing, extracting, and marketing China's oil.|$|E
