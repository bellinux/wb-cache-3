5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's {{characteristics}} are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. The inability to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics is a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E

5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, {{there are several}} reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

Though a pop culture phenomenon {{in the first half of}} the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action {{fought on}} 2 September 1595 {{on the banks}} of the Lippe river, in Germany, between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de Córdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry, {{supported}} by English troops, led by Philip of Nassau. The Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau, taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France, besieged the town of Groenlo in Gelderland, but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp, Cristóbal de Mondragón, organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege. Mondragón next moved to Wesel, positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack. Maurice aimed then, relying on his superior army, to entice Mondragón into a pitched battle, planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap. However, the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander, who organized a counter-ambush.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of Banagher {{as a military}} position on the Shannon and on the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht was early appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about {{the middle of the}} 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was {{in the hands of the}} MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against all comers for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King's County in honour of Philip, but it is doubtful if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
