Dilatometry experiments along 3 directions reveal anisotropic shrinkages, {{which are in}} correlation with different activation energy for sintering. Mullite growth is strongly anisotropic, inducing {{the formation of an}} <b>organized</b> <b>microstructure,</b> where larger mullite crystals are mainly oriented in plane of layer and perpendicular to alumina fibers. Kinetic data from thermal transformations show that the starting reaction mechanism is mullite nucleation, and it is continued by a strongly anisotropic grain growth. It is explained by topotactic transformations at phyllosilicate faces and along alumina arrangements. Mullite growth kinetics is also favored perpendicularly to fiber main dimension by the anisotropy of alumina diffusion coefficient. It shows the limited importance of mullite crystallization in microstructural transformation, but it also shows that controlled mullite growth is central in microstructural arrangement...|$|E

Custom assembly of nucleated grains, aligned in the field direction, has been observed by means of high resolution transmission microscopy. The <b>organized</b> <b>microstructure</b> was obtained {{on the basis of}} the appropriate choice of composition, annealing temperature, related to the initial stages of nanocrystallization process, and magnetic field intensity.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a nonlocal {{extension of the}} elastic-damage interface mechanical model, which is able to describe {{the effects of the}} spatially extended microstructure on the decohesion (or fracture) process along a surface. The key feature of the proposed model is an integral constitutive relation between tractions and displacement jumps at the interface. The presence of an integral kernel brings in the model an internal length measure, which characterizes the transition from the microscale, dominated by heterogeneities and discontinuous media, to the mesoscale, characterized as an enhanced homogenized continuum with nonlocal features. The motivations and the fields of applications of the presented approach are rooted on the observation that, in many micromechanical circumstances, the potential process zone, where decohesion might develop, involves a spatial extended and <b>organized</b> <b>microstructure,</b> that produces complex elastic bridging spatial effects. The present model is a generalization of the classical (local) interface and should be adopted when the size of the microstructure, in the interface, is comparable {{to the size of the}} process zone. Typically, spatial constitutive interactions can be well modeled by means of integral (nonlocal) relations. In nonlocal constitutive equations, the stress at a point is related to the strain field at the neighboring points, by means of an integral weighting relation. The nonlocal interface constitutive relations are developed following a thermodynamically consistent approach. The damage development along the interface is driven by a nonlocal damage activation function, where the damage driving force is related to a nonlocal strain measure. Namely, a spatial average energy release rate is responsible for the local decohesion development. The model has been implemented in a finite element code, and some numerical applications of microfracture are examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{importance of}} the cysteine-rich γ-prolamin in kafirin and zein functionality has been neglected. The role of γ-kafirin in <b>organized</b> <b>microstructures</b> was investigated in microparticles. Residual kafirin (total kafirin minus γ-kafirin) “microparticles” were non-discrete (amorphous mass of material), as viewed by electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Adding 15 % γ-kafirin to residual kafirin resulted {{in the formation of}} a mixture of non-discrete material and nanosize discrete spherical structures. Adding 30 % γ-kafirin to the residual kafirin resulted in discrete spherical nanosize particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that γ-kafirin had a mixture of random-coil and β-sheet conformations, in contrast to total kafirin, which is mainly α-helical conformation. γ-Kafirin also had a very high glass transition temperature (Tg) (≈ 270 °C). The conformation and high Tg of γ-kafirin probably confer structural stability to kafirin microstructures. Because of its ability to form disulfide cross-links, γ-kafirin appears to be essential to form and stabilize <b>organized</b> <b>microstructures.</b> Joseph Anyango is grateful for the provision of a University of Pretoria Postdoctoral Fellowship.

To achieve such hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>microstructures,</b> composition engineering has been considered to be an efficient strategy. In this work, such a panoscopic concept has been extended to demonstrate {{for the first time in}} the case of half-Heusler based thermoelectric materials via a composition engineering route. A series of new off-stoichiometric n-type Zr 0. 7 Hf 0. 3 Ni 1 +xSn (0 <= x <= 0. 10) HH compositions have been modified to derive HH(1 - x) /full-Heusler (FH) (x) composite with an all scale hierarchically modified microstructure with FH inclusions within the matrix to study the temperature dependent thermoelectric properties.

40|$|Developing {{thermoelectric}} {{materials with}} high ZT revolves around various processing techniques, such as doping, substitution chemistry, and band structure engineering near the Fermi level due to embedded nanoscale precipitates and/or quantum dots, {{and more recently}} introduced compositionally alloyed hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>microstructures.</b> In this work, we have extended atomic scale structural engineering combined with an overarching panoscopic approach enabling the development of hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>microstructures</b> at multiple length scales to Hf-free p-type half-Heusler thermoelectric materials for the first time. A series of compositions ZrCo 1 +xSb 0. 9 Sn 0. 1 have been synthesized employing a fast processing technique of arc melting followed by conventional hot pressing revealing composites of half-Heusler (HH) and full-Heusler (FH) at multiple length scales. Such microstructural modifications at various length scales lead to controlled tuning of the hole density, effective mass and band engineering. Interestingly, a simultaneous large enhancement of the power factor (72 % >) {{and a reduction in}} thermal conductivity (30 % >) of the resulting ZrCo 1 +xSb 0. 9 Sn 0. 1 composites were observed. The enhancement in the power factor was primarily due to the increased Seebeck coefficient which resulted from a reduction in the effective hole carrier density via low energy electron filtering coupled with an increase in the hole carrier's effective mass (m*) due to band off-set minimization. The reduction in thermal conductivity can be ascribed to the enhanced phonon scattering by different frequency heat-carrying phonons due to various grain sizes at multiple length scales, such unique specific design strategies of materials described here result in superior thermoelectric properties which have been compared with several state-of-the-art p-type half Heusler materials. The Bergman-Fel model is used to calculate the effective thermoelectric parameters of these composites for comparing the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMechanical {{deformation}} {{applied at}} the joint or tissue level is transmitted through the macroscale extracellular matrix to the microscale local matrix, {{where it is}} transduced to cells within these tissues and modulates tissue growth, maintenance, and repair. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how applied tissue strain is transferred through the local matrix to the cell and nucleus in meniscus, tendon, and the annulus fibrosus, as well as in stem cell-seeded scaffolds engineered to reproduce the <b>organized</b> <b>microstructure</b> of these native tissues. To carry out this study, we developed a custom confocal microscope-mounted tensile testing device and simultaneously monitored strain across multiple length scales. Results showed that mean strain was heterogeneous and significantly attenuated, but coordinated, at the local matrix level in native tissues (35 – 70 % strain attenuation). Conversely, freshly seeded scaffolds exhibited very direct and uniform strain transfer from the tissue to the local matrix level (15 – 25 % strain attenuation). In addition, strain transfer from local matrix to cells and nuclei was dependent on fiber orientation and tissue type. Histological analysis suggested that different domains exist within these fibrous tissues, with most of the tissue being fibrous, characterized by an aligned collagen structure and elongated cells, and other regions being proteoglycan (PG) -rich, characterized by a dense accumulation of PGs and rounder cells. In meniscus, the observed heterogeneity in strain transfer correlated strongly with cellular morphology, where rounder cells located in PG-rich microdomains were shielded from deformation, while elongated cells in fibrous microdomains deformed readily. Collectively, these findings suggest that different tissues utilize distinct strain-attenuating mechanisms according to their unique structure and cellular phenotype, and these differences likely alter the local biologic response of such tissues and constructs in response to mechanical perturbation...|$|E
40|$|The {{dislocation}} microstructure of mantle {{materials can}} account simultaneously for long-term steady-state creep, and for stress wave attenuation at seismic frequencies. The hypothesis {{that a single}} microstructural model explains the rheology for characteristic times ranging from 1 to 10 ^(10) seconds {{can be used to}} restrict the class of permissible rheological models for the mantle. We review steady-state dislocation damping models in order of increasing complexity, and reject those which do not satisfy laboratory data or geophysical constraints. This elimination procedure leads us to consider an <b>organized</b> <b>microstructure,</b> in which most dislocations are found inside subgrain walls. The cells contain relatively few dislocation links. These are free to bow under small, i. e. seismic, stresses. The time constant of this mechanism is controlled either by the diffusion of kinks or of point defects bound to the dislocation line. The glide of intragrain dislocations explains the magnitude and frequency range of seismic attenuation. Steady-state creep is governed by recovery through climb and annihilation in cell walls. Under conditions of jog undersaturation, climb is controlled by jog formation in addition to self-diffusion, and the model requires a higher creep activation energy than for self-diffusion, in agreement with observations on olivine. Quantitative agreement with laboratory data is achieved if the density of cell-wall dislocations is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the density of intracell dislocations. Self-diffusion is probably controlled by silicon diffusion at low pressure and by oxygen diffusion at high pressure. The long-term tectonic stress is the dominant factor determining scale lengths; as a result, the total strength of the relaxation associated with bowing of intracell dislocation links is fixed by the geometry and is of the order of 10 %. This limits the width of the seismic absorption band to 2 - 3 decades in frequency for each mantle mineral. The actual position of the seismic absorption band is determined primarily {{as a result of a}} trade-off between temperature, pressure and tectonic stress. This model provides a physical framework within which the quality factor Q and viscosity are related via the dislocation microstructure...|$|E

Three shapes of microstructure grooves were investigated, with same groove height (600 μm) and five spacing dimensions (600, 750, 1000, 1500 μm), in water flows with velocities of up to 0. 4 m/s. This was done for all selected types of riblet, which are fixed with the direction aligned with the flow.

The presence of a natural hierarchical architecture of different length scales in the composite samples is confirmed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Detailed characterization reveals that in the composite samples there is a slight migration of Cu into the Ag site. Composite samples exhibit extremely low thermal conductivity similar to 2 mW cm(- 1) K- 1 at 773 K, which is nearly one third of the pure AgCrSe 2 and CuCrSe 2. The composite samples exhibit a high ZT similar to 1. 4 at 773 K, which is attributed to the scattering of heat carrying phonons of all wavelengths via the natural hierarchical architecture of the material.

During sintering, typical nucleation and growth processes of mullite produce specific microstructural characteristics, such as bulk zones, oriented fibers and large interfacial zones between the fibers and the bulk.

They evolved within the metazoa as an adaptation for <b>organizing</b> membrane <b>microstructure</b> and directing membrane traffic. Molecular cloning has identified one Caenorhabditis elegans (unc- 44), two Drosophila (Dank 1, Dank 2) and three mammalian (Ank 1, Ank 2, Ank 3) genes. We have previously identified a 76 amino acid alternatively spliced sequence that is present in muscle polypeptides encoded by the rat Ank 3 gene. A closely related sequence in a muscle Ank 1 product binds the cytoskeletal muscle proteins obscurin and titin. This Obscurin/Titin-Binding-related Domain (OTBD) contains repeated modules of 18 amino acids: three are encoded by Ank 1 and Ank 2, two by Ank 3; this pattern is conserved throughout vertebrate ankyrin genes. The Caenorhabditis elegans ankyrin, UNC- 44, contains one 18 amino acid module, as does the ankyrin gene in the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, but the insect ankyrins contain none. Our data indicate that an ancestral ankyrin acquired a 18 amino acid module which was preserved in the ecdysozoa/deuterostome divide, but it was subsequently lost from arthropods. Successive duplications of the module led to a gain of function in vertebrates as it acquired obscurin/titin binding activity.

This material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in periodontal surgical procedures. In a study done with 45S5 Bioglass, control biofilms of S. sanguis were grown on inactive glass particulates and the biofilm grown on the Bioglass was significantly lower than those that were on the inactive glass. It was concluded that Bioglass can reduce surface bacterial formation, which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound healing. The most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is S53P4, which has exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it. Bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived, such as CaPSiO and CaPSiO II, have also exhibited antibacterial property. Studies done with S. epidermidis and E. coli cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the 45S5 bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance.

We have defined mouse and human cardiac 4. 1 transcripts; other than 4. 1 B in humans, all genes show activity. Cardiac transcripts constitutively include conserved FERM and C-terminal domains; both interact with membrane-bound signaling/transport/cell adhesion molecules. Variable splicing within and adjacent to the central spectrin/actin-binding domain enables regulation of cytoskeleton-binding activity. A novel heart-specific exon occurs in human 4. 1 G, but not in mouse. Immunofluorescence reveals 4. 1 staining within mouse cardiomyocytes; thus, both at the plasma membrane and, interdigitated with sarcomeric myosin, across myofibrils in regions close to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

We propose that progressive orientation {{is a result of}} competition between nacre crystals at the growth front of lamellae, which favours selection of crystals whose fastest growth axis (b-axis) is oriented parallel to the direction of propagation of the lamella. A theoretical model has been developed, which simulates competition of rhombic plates at the lamellar growth front as well as epitaxial growth of crystals onto those of the preceding lamella. The model predicts that disordered nacre progressively produces bivalve-like oriented nacre. As growth fronts become diffuse (as is the common case in bivalves) it takes longer for nacre to become organized. Formation of microdomains of nacre platelets with different orientations is also reproduced. In conclusion, not only the organic matrix component, but also the mineral phase plays an active role in <b>organizing</b> the final <b>microstructure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The use {{of ceramic}} {{processes}} inducing a microstructural organization at the grain scale favors {{the improvement of}} strength and toughness. With layered structures, {{it is possible to}} design the microstructural characteristics of materials, leading to increased threshold strength. Layered structures can be arranged to control the local residual stresses causing elastic mismatches between dissimilar materials and crack deflection at interfaces. In this way, multilayer composites from kaolinite and alumina or mullite fibers were shaped by tape casting and staked by thermo-compression, or by centrifugation. During sintering, they show at strong anisotropic behavior, which is in correlation with different activation energy for sintering. Mullite growth is also anisotropic, inducing the formation of an <b>organized</b> micro composite <b>microstructure.</b> The mechanical and elastic properties are correlated with the organization degree of mullite crystals, due to the formation of an interconnected mullite network in the microstructure. It is also shown that variations of mechanical and elastic properties are correlated with the texture index obtained by Quantitative Texture Analysis from X-ray data. The anisotropy of the elastic properties is evidenced by different values of Young’s modulus in directions parallel and perpendicular to the casting direction. Beside, the crack growth resistance is governed by discontinuities along layer boundaries and fiber interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineered}} scaffolds {{must have}} an <b>organized</b> and repeatable <b>microstructure</b> which enables cells to assemble in an ordered matrix that allows adequate nutriental perfusion. In this work, to evaluate the reciprocal cell interactions of endothelial and osteoblast-like cells, human osteoblast-like cells (MG 63) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were co-seeded onto 3 D geometrically controlled porous poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and cultured {{by means of a}} rotary cell culture system (RCCS- 4 DQ). In our dynamic co-culture system, the lack of significant enhancement of osteoblast ALP activity and ECM production indicated that the microgravity conditions of the rotary system affected the cells by favoring their proliferation and cellular cross-talk. These results emphasize how osteoblasts increase endothelial cell proliferate and endothelial cells amplify the growth of osteoblasts but decrease their differentiation. This dynamic seeding of osteoblasts and endothelial cells onto a 3 D polymeric scaffold may represent a unique approach for studying the mechanisms of interaction of endothelial and osteoblast cells as well as achieve a functional hybrid in which angiogenesis, furnished by neo-vascular organization of endothelial cells may further support osteoblasts growth. Furthermore, this in vitro model may be useful in examining the applicability of novel material structures for tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|Manual {{wheelchair}} uses rely {{on their}} upper limbs for mobility and activities of daily living. Unfortunately {{more than half of}} manual wheelchair users will experience shoulder pain, due in part to repetitive loading during wheelchair propulsion and transfers. While chronic upper extremity pathology has been well documented, no research has investigated acute rotator cuff changes that occur as a result of wheelchair propulsion. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, convenient method to examine soft tissue structures of the shoulder, but tendinosis is rated subjectively by the operator. Here we apply image analysis techniques to quantify tendon size, echogenicity, and greyscale texture. We have developed a standardized protocol, and custom reference marker, to maximize reliability of these measures. Further, content validity was established by relating greyscale-based quantitative ultrasound measures to known risk factors for shoulder pain and pathology including increased age, duration of wheelchair use, and body weight. Quantitative ultrasound measures also correlated to clinically graded tendinosis and discriminated between people with and without symptoms on physical examination. Sixty-seven manual wheelchair users underwent quantitative ultrasound examinations of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons before and after an intense wheelchair propulsion task. Biceps tendon greyscale texture post-propulsion was significantly impacted by clinically graded tendinopathy, duration of wheelchair use, resultant force, and stroke frequency when controlling for pre-propulsion ultrasound image texture. Subjects with tendinopathy or a longer duration of wheelchair use tended to have a darker, less <b>organized</b> tendon <b>microstructure</b> following propulsion likely due to the presence of inflammatory factors or other fluid. In contrast, subjects who used a higher stroke frequency or resultant force showed a brighter, more aligned tendon fibrillar structure due to mechanical loading of the tendon. In a subsample of subjects, we found that increased shoulder forces and moments during propulsion correlated with more severe supraspinatus tendinopathy. These subjects also experienced a larger decrease in supraspinatus tendon width and greyscale variance following the intense propulsion task. Quantitative ultrasound measures describe tendon microstructure and are sensitive to risk factors for shoulder pain and pathology. This technique may help identify the best interventions to reduce an individual's risk of developing upper limb pathology...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiomyocytes are <b>organized</b> in <b>microstructures</b> termed {{sheetlets}} that reorientate during {{left ventricular}} thickening. Diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) may enable noninvasive interrogation of in vivo cardiac microstructural dynamics. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) {{is a condition}} of abnormal myocardium with unknown sheetlet function. Objectives: This study sought to validate in vivo DT-CMR measures of cardiac microstructure against histology, characterize microstructural dynamics during left ventricular wall thickening, and apply the technique in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM. Methods: In vivo DT-CMR was acquired throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy swine, followed by in situ and ex vivo DT-CMR, then validated against histology. In vivo DT-CMR was performed in 19 control subjects, 19 DCM, and 13 HCM patients. Results: In swine, a DT-CMR index of sheetlet reorientation (E 2 A) changed substantially (E 2 A mobility ∼ 46 °). E 2 A changes correlated with wall thickness changes (in vivo r 2 = 0. 75; in situ r 2 = 0. 89), were consistently observed under all experimental conditions, and accorded closely with histological analyses in both relaxed and contracted states. The potential contribution of cyclical strain effects to in vivo E 2 A was ∼ 17 %. In healthy human control subjects, E 2 A increased from diastole (18 °) to systole (65 °; p < 0. 001; E 2 A mobility = 45 °). HCM patients showed significantly greater E 2 A in diastole than control subjects did (48 °; p < 0. 001) with impaired E 2 A mobility (23 °; p < 0. 001). In DCM, E 2 A was similar to control subjects in diastole, but systolic values were markedly lower (40 °; p < 0. 001) with impaired E 2 A mobility (20 °; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Myocardial microstructure dynamics can be characterized by in vivo DT-CMR. Sheetlet function was abnormal in DCM with altered systolic conformation and reduced mobility, contrasting with HCM, which showed reduced mobility with altered diastolic conformation. These novel insights significantly improve understanding of contractile dysfunction {{at a level of}} noninvasive interrogation not previously available in humans...|$|R
40|$|Carbon-carbon (C/C) {{composites}} are notable among engineering {{materials in}} aerospace and defense industries possessing excellent specific mechanical, thermal, frictional and wear properties. C/C maintain their properties at temperatures {{where most of}} the high end alloys give in, and maintain their dimensional stability at temperatures above 2000 oC. C/C is frequently used in aircraft and automotive industries as brake materials. However, frictional performance is dependent on various parameters: microstructure, fiber type, fiber orientation distribution, fiber/matrix interfacial bond, heat treatment, and oxidation. The present study in dissertation provides an insight into the impact of heat treatment, and oxidation on microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties. The heat treatment (performed at 1800, 2100, 2400 oC in argon) of two-directional (2 -D) pitch-fiber with charred resin carbon matrix, and three-directional (3 -D) PAN-fiber with CVI carbon matrix influenced microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties. Microstructure characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), XRD, and Raman spectroscopy changed with increasing heat treatment temperature. The RL microstructure of 3 -D C/C progressively highly <b>organized,</b> whereas ISO <b>microstructure</b> of 2 -D C/C 2 ̆ 7 s charred resin hardly organized into an ordered structure as evident from Raman spectroscopy and Raman profiling of polished samples. Pitch-fiber organized more than the ISO microstructure of charred resin matrix. On the other, PAN-fiber became more ordered, but was organization was lower than pitch-fiber. Thermal conductivity increased for both (2 -D, 3 -D C/C) materials in comparison to non-heat treated (NHT) C/Cs. Thermal conductivity of oxidized samples decreased significantly than non-oxidized samples. In-plane thermal conductivity of 3 -D C/C was much higher than that of 2 -D C/C, and was attributed to the rough laminar (RL) microstructure of carbon matrix and continuous PAN-fiber when compared to the short pitch-fiber in isotropic (ISO) carbon matrix. Mechanical properties (tensile, compressive, shear) deteriorated with increasing heat treatment. However, statistical analysis using ANOVA showed that there was not any significant difference between the NHT and heat treated C/C materials in terms of mechanical strength, modulus, failure strain and fracture energy. The oxidized samples of heat treated (1800 / 2100 / 2400 oC) C/C materials (2 -D, 3 -D) showed an appreciable decrease in mechanical strength and modulus than non-oxidized samples, with progressively heat treated C/C becoming more oxidation resistant than NHT C/C. The study demonstrated a highly inhomogeneous nature of C/C, and sample size is a very important parameter in governing mechanical properties. Since, the slightest change in the dimension of samples could bring about a radically different outcome in terms of mechanical properties, and can hardly be representative of the bulk properties. Therefore, in order to obtain a good estimate of the bulk properties, the sample size must be comparable to the bulk material. The research nonetheless showed the impact of sample size in estimating the mechanical properties of bulk properties, which are highly significant after statistical analysis, and, therefore, it {{must be taken into account}} to understand the processing-structure-property-analysis relationships...|$|R
