5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
25|$|A dome lounge {{is a type}} of domed {{railroad}} {{passenger car}} that includes lounge, cafe, dining or other space on the upper level or both levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Examples include both short (approximately half <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> with <b>the</b> dome located just forward or just rearward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> center) and full (taking almost <b>the</b> entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car).</b> Some examples include sleeping compartments or coach seating.|$|R
50|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Car</b> Allowance Rebate System bill made buyers {{eligible}} for <b>the</b> scrap value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> along with <b>the</b> rebate, with the dealers taking in $50 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value {{and to share}} <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value to the buyer. While some dealers and Car Dealer Associations have argued that buyers were not entitled to <b>the</b> scrap value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> advocacy groups and State Attorney's General argued that the law made the issue clear that buyers were entitled to <b>the</b> scrap value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Some dealers have claimed that they did pass on <b>the</b> scrap value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to buyers.|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{embedding}} formula <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra into <b>the</b> Cuntz algebra O 2 p, properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra are {{studied in}} detail by restricting those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cuntz algebra. Various ∗-endomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cuntz algebra are explicitly constructed, and transcribed into those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra. In particular, a set <b>of</b> ∗-endomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra into its even subalgebra are constructed. According to branching formulae, which are obtained by composing representations and ∗-endomorphisms, it is {{shown that a}} KMS state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra is obtained through the above even-CAR endomorphisms from the Fock representation. A U(2 p) action on O 2 p induces ∗-automorphisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra, which are given by nonlinear transformations expressed in terms of polynomials in generators. It is shown that, among such ∗-automorphisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAR</b> algebra, there exists a family of one-parameter groups of ∗-automorphisms describing time evolutions of fermions, in which <b>the</b> particle number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system changes by time while the Fock vacuum is kept invariant...|$|R
5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four cars were {{successfully}} overhauled for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> Thirty-three more cars were overhauled in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E

5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two {{of which}} will be {{remote-controlled}} from his master vehicle. Fireflash will be guided into a controlled landing on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.|$|E
5|$|Cars premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, and was theatrically {{released}} on June 9, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics. It {{was nominated for}} two Academy Awards including Best Animated Feature, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film was {{released on}} DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One Man Band for its theatrical and home media releases. Merchandise based on the film (including scale models of several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars)</b> broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney/Pixar film, bringing an estimated $10 billion for 5 years after the film's release. The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, {{who was killed in}} a car accident during the film's production.|$|E

5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved {{to have a}} superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot {{in an attempt to}} clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|The game's visuals and {{spectacle}} were lauded {{by critics}} who suspected {{that it would}} amaze players. Reed questioned {{whether it was the}} best looking game to have ever been made. Critics observed that the use high frame rate and motion blur helped convey an incredible sense of speed. Other aspects such particle effects, reflections, and real-time deformation drew praise as well. Critics expressed approval over the sound design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and collisions. However opinions of the licensed soundtrack and DJ were less favourable. Some writers found the DJ's enthusiastic dialogue to be annoying and had mixed opinions on the songs included in the soundtrack, but were thankful for the available audio customisation options.|$|E

5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a step forward in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E

5|$|The {{first order}} for {{electric}} multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being {{withdrawn from the}} Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 × 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on the busy circle and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.|$|E
