25|$|British {{infantry}} {{was brought}} forward to fortify and provide garrisons {{along the length}} of the railway. They formed a firm base for mobile operations and defence in depth for the huge administrative organisation advancing with the railway, in support of the Anzac Mounted Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The movement of the infantry across Sinai was eased by construction of wire netting roads also used by Egyptian Labour Corps, light vehicles, cars, and ambulances. This reasonably stable surface, which did not sink, was constructed from two or four rolls of rabbit wire; one inch mesh wire rolled <b>out</b> <b>side</b> by side, wired together with the edges fixed into the sand with long steel or wooden pegs to produce a reasonable track.|$|E
500|$|An EP {{containing}} [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] and {{the three}} other new soundtrack songs had been scheduled for September 1968, but a full album was created instead. With {{the addition of the}} previously issued [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] and [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] to fill <b>out</b> <b>side</b> one of the LP, George Martin's orchestral pieces from the film made up the second side. Viewed as a secondary release beside the band's recently issued double LP, The Beatles, the Yellow Submarine album appeared in January 1969, six months after the film's London premiere. In January 1996, [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] (backed by [...] "Only a Northern Song") was issued on a jukebox-only single, pressed on blue vinyl, as part of a series of Beatles releases by Capitol Records' CEMA Special Markets division.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{disagreement}} {{as to the}} exact definition of striking <b>out</b> the <b>side.</b> Some feel a pitcher should be credited with striking <b>out</b> the <b>side</b> when all three outs in the inning were obtained via the strikeout, regardless of what other hitters the pitcher has faced have done.

2500|$|In Nashville, Altman used sets with {{noticeable}} {{colors of}} reds, whites and blues. For The Long Goodbye, {{he insisted that}} Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects. Zsigmond states that Altman [...] "wanted to do something different" [...] in this film, {{and told him he}} [...] "wanted the camera to move—all the time. Up. down. In and <b>out.</b> <b>Side</b> to side." [...] Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, [...] "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working." ...|$|E

60|$|In fact, {{none of the}} idols in Benares are {{handsome}} or attractive. And what a {{swarm of}} them there is! The town is a vast museum of idols--and all of them crude, misshapen, and ugly. They flock through one's dreams at night, a wild mob of nightmares. When {{you get tired of}} them in the temples and take a trip on the river, you find idol giants, flashily painted, stretched <b>out</b> <b>side</b> by side on the shore. And apparently wherever there is room for one more lingam, a lingam is there. If Vishnu had foreseen what his town was going to be, he would have called it Idolville or Lingamburg.|$|E
60|$|It {{was the old}} story. There were so many drinks to be drunk, and as {{the warm}} magic poured through our veins and mellowed our voices and {{affections}} {{we knew it was}} no time to make invidious distinctions--to drink with this shipmate and to decline to drink with that shipmate. We were all shipmates who had been through stress and storm together, who had pulled and hauled on the same sheets and tackles, relieved one another's wheels, laid <b>out</b> <b>side</b> by side on the same jib-boom when she was plunging into it and looked to see who was missing when she cleared and lifted. So we drank with all, and all treated, and our voices rose, and we remembered a myriad kindly acts of comradeship, and forgot our fights and wordy squabbles, and knew one another for the best fellows in the world.|$|E

Well, we made a snow-house just like that one; and as we worked very hard, we had it up and were all snug under its shelter {{in little more than}} two hours. Meanwhile, the dogs were fed; and a small piece of wood, that we fortunately brought with us on the sled, was cut up, and a fire kindled. But this only served long enough to boil the kettle; and then it went out, leaving us to eat our supper in the dark, for by this time the sun had set. However, we did not mind that much; and when we had finished, and were stretched <b>out</b> <b>side</b> by side on the snow, smoking our pipes, while the dogs lay at our feet and kept us warm, I thought that a palace {{could not have been more}} comfortable than our snow-house.|$|E

'till there are left no feet upon our ponies. Thus far for sport.' He dropped one hand on his sword-hilt and his eye wandered to Dirkovitch lolling back in his chair.
