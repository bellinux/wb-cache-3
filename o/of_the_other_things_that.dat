6000|$|The {{history of}} one of these ragged clients is to our point. [...] "Among those," [...] he wrote to Madame Voland,[48] [...] "whom chance and misery sent to my address was one Glénat, who knew mathematics, wrote a good hand, and was in want of bread. I did all I could to extricate him from his embarrassments. I went begging for {{customers}} for him on every side. If he came at meal-times, I would not let him go; if he lacked shoes, I gave him them; now and then I slipped a shilling into his hands as well. he had the air of the worthiest man in the world, and he even bore his neediness with a certain gaiety that used to amuse me. I was fond of chatting with him; he seemed to set little store by fortune, fame, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> charm or dazzle us in life. Seven or eight days ago Damilaville wrote to send this man to him, for one of his friends who had a manuscript for him to copy. I send him; the manuscript is entrusted to him--a work on religion and government. I do not know how it came about, but that manuscript is {{now in the hands of}} the lieutenant of police. Damilaville gives me word of this. I hasten to my friend Glénat, to warn him to count no more upon me. 'And why am I not to count upon you?' 'Because you are a marked man. The police have their eyes upon you and 'tis impossible to send work to you.' 'But, my dear sir, there's no risk, so long as you entrust nothing reprehensible to my hands. The police only come here when they scent game. I cannot tell how they do it, but they are never mistaken.' 'Ah well, I at any rate know how it is, and you have let me see much more in the matter than I ever expected to learn from you,' and with that I turn my back on my rascal." [...] Diderot having occasion to visit the lieutenant of police, introduced the matter, and could not withhold an energetic remonstrance against such an odious abuse of a man's kindness of heart, as the introduction of spies to his fireside. M. de Sartine laughed and Diderot took his leave, vowing that all the wretches who should come to him for the future, with cuffs dirty and torn, with holes in their stockings and holes in their shoes, with hair all unkempt, in shabby overcoats with many rents, or scanty black suits with starting seams, with all the tones and looks of distressed worth, would henceforth seem to him no better than police emissaries and scoundrels set to spy on him. The vow, we may be sure, was soon forgotten, but the story shows how seriously in one respect the man of letters in France was worse off than his brother in England.|$|E

Despite a small population, residents of Monticello along with Napa County fought against the creation of the dam all the way to Washington D.C. All evidence of a little town in the valley were demolished; either removed or destroyed except for one. For reasons that is yet to be known the Bureau of Reclamation did leave behind a bridge crossing over Putah Creek although that bridge is far deep under water by now.|$|E

5000|$|Again using Europe Since Napoleon as an example, {{the scope}} of this work is Europe since 1815, but Thomson pointed out a [...] "necessary prologue" [...] {{consisting}} of four main phases {{since the beginning of the}} French Revolution in 1789. He listed these phases as [...] "Revolution, War, Dictatorship, Empire" [...] and set out to show how each gave place to the next and of how profound and permanent was their cumulative impact on later generations. Beginning with the situation in France in 1789, Thomson wrote of the paradox that no significant group wanted revolution, but revolution happened because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they did want. Much had been made by previous historians of an assumed [...] "revolutionary spirit" [...] abroad in France that had been generated by the likes of Voltaire and Rousseau. Thomson argued that a connection between their ideas and the revolution was remote and indirect. They did not preach revolution and were happy to be patronised by any aristocrat so willing. It was later that their ideas and doctrines were used to justify revolutionary events. Instead, Thomson argued, what mattered in 1789 was a [...] "revolutionary situation" [...] that turned people into revolutionaries in spite of themselves. The philosophes played no part in the creation of this situation which came about essentially because the King, and thereby the entire French State, was in dire financial straits. The state of the economy, not philosophical belief, caused the French Revolution.|$|E

5000|$|... "In 1971 Resources for the Future {{funded and}} {{published}} a book calling {{for the government to}} create a market for radio spectrum licenses, rather than just giving them away. After all, said the author, Harvey J. Levin, the airwaves are a scarce resource, and they are no less susceptible than rivers or roads to overuse or congestion. Because the Federal Communications Commission was allocating spectrum space bureaucratically, incumbent broadcasters had no reasons to economize or innovate, while newcomers were often locked out. Levin, an economist, proposed ‘a regulated market-type system with prices.’ And the government took Levin’s advice - in the mid-1990s, when the FCC finally began auctioning off broadcast frequencies. Well, it only took a generation."— Jonathan Rauch, National Journal"In the world of economists, his ideas were not radical, but in the world that would need to use them, they were... Levin concluded that market-like mechanisms, rather than administrative hearings, would better allocate the increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum, or airwaves, to their myriad uses (ranging from radio, TV, and everyday telecommunications to wildlife tracking, astronomy, garage door openers, and national defense). Levin’s research paved the way for a change of heart at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission auctioning portions of the spectrum. By 1997, auctions had brought in more than $22 billion and, more important, according to the Economic Report of the President for that year, the auctions got spectrum ‘quickly into the hands of service providers’ and ‘rapidly promoted the use of innovative, advanced telecommunications technologies throughout the country’… In 1997, the U.S. Congress included a demonstration program for space transportation vouchers in its appropriations bill for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Much of the inspiration… was inspired by Levin’s research. The field of space economics and policy has grown from one or two economists during Levin’s career to include scholars at Cal Tech, MIT, the Wharton School, and other institutions."— Molly K. Macauley, Senior Fellow, Resources for the Future"The classic overview of spectrum technology, economics, and public policy is Harvey J. Levin's The Invisible Resource... He was truly several decades ahead of his time... In some areas, people still haven't caught up to him. For example, I have yet to find anybody else provide a more thoughtful spectrum leasing analysis - a very timely topic here in D.C."— J. H. Snider, Senior Research Fellow, New America Foundation"He was... universally well thought of... The FCC sponsored a conference on spectrum called ‘The Invisible Resource.’ Harvey was a featured speaker… It was the 30th of April, 1991 - one year to the day he died… He had truly been one of the pioneers in broadcast regulation, and we both liked to think that I was following in his footsteps."— Thomas W. Hazlett, Chief Economist, Federal Communications Commission (1992)"He was a notable scholar... in ways that were an example for all of us: his commitment and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> went with it, his constant peregrinations in search of bringing his message to people all over this country {{and the rest of the}} world… With all his ways and his accomplishments, Harvey, above all, was a true original, and he was an original in a time that breeds all too many hollow men, if not stuffed men."— John E. Ullmann, Professor of Management and Quantitative Methods, Hofstra University School of Business"In his professional, civic and personal life, he strived to improve the rights, opportunities, facilities and technologies of the disadvantaged, in America as well as in his own backyard, and in third world countries. With zeal, optimism, humor and irony, he proposed innovative policies regarding orbit spectrum assignments and broadcast frequency auctions to skeptical and dismissing industry officials. In the face of industry and government laissez faire, he remained the true believer.

CCS {{is one of the more}} expensive and technically challenging carbon emissions abatement options available, and CCS must first and foremost be considered in the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can be done to reduce emissions, as a part of an overall optimally efficient, sustainable and economic mitigation plan. This elevates the analysis beyond a simple comparison of the cost per tonne of CO 2 abated—there are inherent tradeoffs with a range of other factors (such as water, NOx, SOx, biodiversity, energy, and human health and safety, among others) which must also be considered if we are to achieve truly sustainable mitigation. The full life-cycle cost of CCS must be considered in the context of the overall social, environmental and economic benefits which it creates, and the costs associated with environmental and social risks it presents. Such analysis reveals that all CCS is not create...|$|E
