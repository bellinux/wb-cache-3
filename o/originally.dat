5|$|Several taxa {{have been}} named as {{belonging}} to the genus Sarcosphaera over the years, but most lack modern descriptions and have not been reported since their original collections. For example, Sarcosphaera funerata was renamed by Fred Jay Seaver in 1930 based on the basionym Peziza funerata, <b>originally</b> described by Cooke in 1878. Sarcosphaera gigantea was a species collected from Michigan, <b>originally</b> described as Pustularia gigantea by Heinrich Rehm in 1905, and considered distinct from S.coronaria {{on the basis of}} its smaller spore size. Sarcosphaera ulbrichiana was described by Wilhem Kirschstein in 1943. Other taxa have been reduced to synonymy with S.coronaria, or transferred to other genera. Sarcosphaera eximia (<b>originally</b> Peziza eximia Durieu & Lév. 1848, and later transferred to Sarcosphaera by René Maire), Sarcosphaera crassa (considered by Zdeněk Pouzar in a 1972 publication to be the correct name for S.coronaria) and Sarcosphaera dargelasii (<b>originally</b> Peziza dargelasii Gachet 1829, transferred to Sarcosphaera by Nannfeldt) are now considered synonyms of S.coronaria. Sarcosphaera ammophila (<b>originally</b> Peziza ammophila Durieu & Mont.) and Sarcosphaera amplissima (<b>originally</b> Peziza amplissima Fr. 1849) have since been transferred back to Peziza. The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) considers Sarcosphaera to be monotypic, and Index Fungorum has only Sarcosphaera coronaria confirmed as valid.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were <b>originally</b> faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, <b>originally</b> only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall <b>originally</b> extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E
