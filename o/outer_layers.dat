5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|The blown-off <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> {{of dying}} stars include heavy elements, {{which may be}} {{recycled}} during the formation of new stars.

5|$|The {{characteristics}} of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} pressure {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses {{toward the center of the}} star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's <b>outer</b> <b>layers,</b> beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity.

5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>layers,</b> reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit.

5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core will increase {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant.
