5|$|To {{maintain}} morale, wartime censors minimized early {{reports of}} illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. However, papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This reporting dichotomy created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, Spanish Flu. In Spain, a different nickname was adopted, the Naples Soldier (Soldado de Nápoles), which came from a musical operetta (zarzuela) titled La canción del olvido (The Song <b>of</b> <b>Forgetting),</b> which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave. Federico Romero, one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, Naples Soldier, was as catchy as the flu.|$|E

An {{academic}} conference was held in New York in April 2011 to discuss the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports, resulting in a book, The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary (2011), edited by Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel and published by Columbia University Press. In 2014 historian Michael Fleming reappraised {{the impact of the}} Vrba–Wetzler report in Auschwitz, the Allies and Censorship of the Holocaust (Cambridge University Press, 2014).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he felt she was too busy, to the point <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court {{if he did not}} apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E

25|$|The normal {{endogenous}} compounds which {{block the}} activation of NMDA receptors prevent forgetting. Knowing this, researchers hypothesized that hyper-activating these receptors (instead of blocking them) would enhance their activity, and increase forgetting. D-cycloserine is a chemical which enhances (agonist) {{the activity of}} the NMDA receptors. When used in rats, D-cycloserine was shown to produce results which reflected this idea. Rats which had been administered it had enhanced levels <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> than rats who had not been.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifespan}} retrieval {{curve is}} a graph {{that represents the}} number of autobiographical memories encoded at various ages during the life span. The lifespan retrieval curve contains three different parts. From birth to five years old {{is a period of}} childhood amnesia, from 10 to 30 years old is the reminiscence bump and last is a period <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> {{from the end of the}} reminiscence bump to present time. The reminiscence bump has been observed on the lifespan retrieval curve in multiple studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{interference}} {{theory can}} be seen {{as one of the most}} important theories <b>of</b> <b>forgetting.</b> It indicates that prior, posterior or new learning information compete with already existing ones and therefore forgetting occurs. This inhibition can be divided into two types: the retroactive inhibition, where information acquired at a later point in time blocks the information that was acquired earlier. Proactive inhibition means that information acquired in the past can infer with new information. Hence, a blocking can occur that inhibits the acquiring of the new target item (Ecke 2004: 325).|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{researchers}} Saper and Stickgold {{point out}} that {{an essential part of}} memory and learning consists of nerve cell dendrites' sending of information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections. This process demands that no external information is presented to these dendrites, and it is suggested that this may be why it is during sleep that memories and knowledge are solidified and organized. Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli have focused on the process <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> by pruning weaker connections during sleep, to select important memories and enable future memory encoding. They further suggest that synaptic potentiation drives Process S (homeostatic need for sleep).|$|E
25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
25|$|Both East and West Paterson {{changed their}} names in hopes of dissociating {{themselves}} from the larger city of Paterson, which is significantly poorer and faces higher levels of crime, while preserving their E.P. and W.P. initials. In West Paterson, proponents of name change argued that their proposal would improve the borough's reputation and thus property values within the borough, as outsiders {{would be less likely}} to confuse it with Paterson. Opponents of the renaming saw no need to change, with businesses and the fire department citing the cost of changing references to the borough's name and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> the community's history as West Paterson. The name change has been marred with accusations of racism and discrimination due to the city of Paterson's lower quality of life and diverse minority demographics. Some Paterson residents and advocates have jokingly suggested renaming Paterson to East Woodland Park and West Elmwood Park.|$|E

500|$|In Spain, {{sources from}} the period {{explicitly}} linked the Spanish flu to the cultural figure of Don Juan.

Davis has argued the Spanish flu–Don Juan connection served a cognitive function, allowing Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through a familiar template, namely the Don Juan story.|$|E
500|$|Most notably, Weizsäcker {{spoke of}} the danger <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> and {{distorting}} the past. [...] "There {{is no such thing}} as the guilt or innocence of an entire nation.

[...] All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans must look truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{composition}} phase, Harris multitrack recorded the rehearsals, allowing the band {{to listen to}} the material and re-examine it, allowing them greater room to jam while writing [...] "without the worry <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> something or not fully understanding what [...] doing". This, coupled with the lack of a deadline, meant that the process was more open-ended for the band, allowing more freedom to abandon failed avenues and giving ideas time to evolve. This attitude was extended to {{the manner in which the}} vocals were tracked – until Wavering Radiant, the vocals had normally been recorded last. Instead, more time was spent recording them; this allowed Aaron Turner, who had steadily grown in confidence as a vocalist, to relax and enjoy the process.|$|E
500|$|After {{the liberation}} of Korea, writers were faced {{with the task of}} {{establishing}} a national literature. Some, like , sought to gather a wide range of both moderate and progressive writers to write [...] "democratic national literature". A writers' association called the [...] (MR: Chosŏn Munhak Kŏnsŏl Ponbu) was founded in 1945 immediately after the liberation by Kim and others. Han, however, disagreed with this approach, accusing it <b>of</b> <b>forgetting</b> class questions. Since the 1930s, Han had already had bad personal relations with these writers originally hailing from the south of Korea. The struggle for dominance in the North Korean literary bureaucracy made them worse. In retaliation Han, together with other writers including Yi Kiyŏng, founded the Korean Proletarian Literature Alliance (MR: Chosŏn P'ŭrollet'aria Munhak Tongmaeng). For Han's purposes his fellow writer Yi Kiyŏng, though respected, was not particularly interested in political matters and thus posed no threat to Han's own aspirations. The two organizations became merged to form [...] (MR: Chosŏn munhakka tongmaeng) in late 1945. Disapproving of this, Han moved {{to the north of the}} country, and was one of the first writers to do so.|$|E

There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E
