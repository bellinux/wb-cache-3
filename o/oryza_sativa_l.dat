50|$|Approximately 30 GRX isoforms are {{described}} in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and 48 in <b>Oryza</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> According to their redox-active centre, they are subgrouped in six classes of the CSYC/S-, CGFS-, CC-type and 3 groups with additional domain of unknown function. The CC-type GRXs are only found in higher plants. In Arabidopsis GRXs are involved in flower development and Salicylic acid signalling.|$|E
40|$|Oligonucleotides, {{corresponding}} to conserved regions of animal protein-serine/threonine kinases, {{were used to}} isolate cDNAs encoding plant homologs in the dicot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and the monocot rice (<b>Oryzae</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.).</b> The C-terminal regions of the deduced polypeptides encoded by the bean (PVPK- 1) and rice (G 11 A) cDNAs, prepared from mRNAs of suspension cultures and leaves, respectively, contain features characteristic of the catalytic domains of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine kinases, indicating that these cDNAs encode plant protein kinases. The putative catalytic domains are most closely related to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and the protein kinase C family, suggesting the plant homologs may likewise transduce extracellular signals. However, outside these domains, PVPK- 1 and G 11 A exhibit no homology either to each other or to regulatory domains of other protein kinases, indicating the plant homologs are modulated by other signals. PVPK- 1 corresponds to a 2. 4 -kb transcript in suspension cultured bean cells. Southern blots of genomic DNA indicate that PVPK- 1 and G 11 A correspond to single copy genes that form {{part of a family}} of related plant sequences...|$|R
30|$|Rice (<b>Oryzae</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> is an {{important}} food crop that feeds {{more than half of}} the world’s population (Khush 2005). Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a destructive disease of rice that reduces yields from 10 to 30  % annually (Skamnioti and Gurr 2009). The most effective and economical way to control the disease is via resistant cultivars (Hulbert et al., 2003). To date, more than 100 blast resistance (R) genes and about 500 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified (Ashkani et al., 2015), and 25 of them have been cloned (Wu et al., 2015; Zheng et al. 2016). However, rice cultivars often lose their resistance to M. oryzae within 3 – 5 years because of the high variability of the fungus in the field (Oliveira-Garcia and Valent 2015; Devi et al. 2015). In major production areas in China, for example, 174 resistant rice cultivars (disease index < 4 on a scale from 0 to 9) released from 2004 to 2008 lost their blast resistance (Feng et al. 2014). It is therefore necessary to identify new rice blast R genes that will be effective against M. oryzae field populations for extended periods.|$|R
40|$|Two {{long-grain rice}} (<b>Oryzae</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> cultivars (Wells and Francis) were {{harvested}} from Stuttgart, AR and Essex, MO at high (21. 0 – 22. 0 %) and low (12. 8 – 16. 3 %) moisture contents (MCs). Rice samples were soaked in distilled water, sodium phosphate buffer and sodium phosphate buffer with a 0. 2 % protease (PS) at 37 C for 30 min before cooking. A uniaxial compression test {{was performed to}} assess cooked rice texture properties. Results showed that protease treatment resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} cooked rice firmness for all cultivars across harvest locations and harvest MC. This indicated that proteins were involved in providing structural support to the rice kernel during cooking, restricting starch granule swelling and water hydration. The increase in cooked rice MC after PS treatment provides support for this finding. Sticki-ness significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by soaking either in water or buffer solutions. This was attributed to a greater solubilization of starch, especially amylose leaching, during cooking. Protease treatment did not significantly increase cooked rice stickiness over the buffer treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The structural integrity of a rice kernel {{plays an important role in}} deter-mining the textural properties of cooked rice. This study demonstrated that protein (i. e., through its disruption using protease) as well as lipid and starch (i. e., removal of starch and lipid during the draining and washing steps) all contribute in determining cooked rice texture properties. Results from this study indicated the possibility of reducing rice cooking duration to achieve texture properties similar to that with no protease treatment. Moreover...|$|R

50|$|The {{brown planthopper}} (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) is a planthopper species that feeds on rice plants (<b>Oryza</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.).</b> BPH {{are among the}} most {{important}} pests of rice, and rice is the major staple crop for about half the world's population. They damage rice directly through feeding and also by transmitting two viruses, rice ragged stunt virus and rice grassy stunt virus. Up to 60% yield loss is common in susceptible rice cultivars attacked by BPH.The BPH are distributed in: Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, North and South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.Their host plant other than rice is Leersia hexandra.|$|E

It is the purpose of this paper to present examples of experimental results obtained by rice research workers which support certain significant principles. Although this treatise will be confined to the rice plant (<b>Oryza</b> <b>sativa</b> L.),as Wittwer (1968) points out, the principles elucidated are applicable to many other crops, and particularly to the small grains, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum <b>L.),</b> oats (Avena <b>sativa</b> <b>L.),</b> barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and rye (Secale cereale L. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{maternal}} parents, diploid (L 202 - 2 x) and autotetraploid (L 202 - 4 x) of <b>Oryza</b> <b>sativa</b> cv. <b>L</b> 202 were crossed with O. officinalis. Embryo {{development and}} fertilization {{in these two}} crosses were comparatively studied. There were no mature hybrid seeds obtained because all the hybridized spikelets died 30 days after pollination. The main reasons for no seed set were abnormal fertilization {{and development of the}} embryos and endosperms in the interspecific hybrids. There were double-fertilization, egg cell single-fertilization and non-fertilization in these crosses. Although 59. 45 % and 54. 87 % of hybrid embryos produced in the crosses of L 202 - 2 x/O. officinalis and L 202 - 4 x/O. officinalis, respectively, hybrid embryos ceased to develop or degenerated and plenty of free endosperm nuclei were in disaggregating state without developing cellular endosperms three days after pollination. Besides, some embryological differences in these two crosses were found, that is, the rate of double-fertilization and total rate of double- and single-fertilization in L 202 - 2 x/O. officinalis were higher than those in L 202 - 4 x/O. officinalis. The embryo and endosperm of hybrids developed more slowly, and embryos and free endosperm nuclei were more severely degenerated in L 202 - 4 x/O. officinalis than in L 202 - 2 x/O. officinalis. Five days after pollination, a few of embryos in L 202 - 2 x/O. officinalis developed into pear-shaped ones, however, embryos in L 202 - 4 x/O. officinalis were all degenerated. Therefore, it is more difficult to obtain interspecific hybrids by wide crosses between autotetraploid of O. sativa and O. officinalis...|$|R

When the developed plants fresh weight was analyzed the treated seeds outperformed plants grown on saline and non-saline medium however when the dry weight was analyzed BR treated seeds only outperformed untreated plants that were grown on saline medium. When dealing with tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) under salt stress the concentration of cholophyll a and cholophyll b were decreased and thus pigmentation was decreased as well. BR treated rice seeds considerably restored the pigment level in plants that were grown on saline medium when compared to non-treated plants under the same conditions.|$|E
