She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume <b>of</b> <b>poetry.</b> Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

When they left, the gods decided {{that it should not}} be poured out, but rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Fortune's time in Wales, in part because {{throughout}} her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself. In later life she reported that {{from the age of}} four she had experienced visions of Atlantis, something which she believed were past life memories. The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900, although by 1904 Fortune was living in Somerset, south-west England. That year, she authored a book <b>of</b> <b>poetry,</b> titled Violets, which was likely published by her family. It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of The Girls' Room, in which it was accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune as a girl. In 1906, her second book <b>of</b> <b>poetry,</b> More Violets, was published.|$|E

5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection <b>of</b> <b>poetry</b> was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality <b>of</b> <b>poetry.</b> Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>poetry</b> often added meaning or depth.
