5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E

25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E
25|$|A {{claystone}} is lithified, and non-fissile mudrock. In {{order for}} a rock {{to be considered a}} claystone, it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of a millimeter in particle size. Clay minerals are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.|$|E
25|$|GC is {{a method}} {{involving}} the separation of different analytes within a sample of mixed gases. The separated gases can be detected multiple ways, {{but one of the}} most powerful detection methods for gas chromatography is mass spectrometry. After the gases separate, they enter the mass spectrometer and are analyzed. This combination not only separates the analytes, but gives structural information about each one. The GC sample must be volatile, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> enter the gas phase, while also being thermally stable so that it does not break down as it is heated to enter the gas phase. Mass spectrometry ionization techniques requiring the sample to be in the gas phase have similar concerns.|$|E

25|$|At this juncture, a {{protectorate}} by the Commonwealth was {{sought by}} the leaders of Hungary, Transylvania and Moldavia. Actively pursuing these relations would require confronting the Habsburg Monarchy. Not willing <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do so, King John III decided to join the Holy League (1684), an anti-Ottoman alliance and the last European crusade project, consisting also of the papal state, Venice and the Holy Roman Empire. The pact's basic goals were recovery of the lost territories and common fight until the time of a commonly agreed peace. The Holy League arrangements severely limited the Commonwealth's ability to exercise its options and future reverses {{can be traced to}} the failure of the decentralized, ineffective Polish diplomacy to protect through negotiations the country's national interest.|$|E
25|$|The team signed American Levi Leipheimer in 2002 as a rider for the Tour de France. Leipheimer {{finished}} {{eighth in}} his first Tour but crashed {{out of the race}} on the first stage of the 2003 Tour de France. Leipheimer finished ninth overall the following year. The team became more of a Grand Tour team as could be seen by Michael Rasmussen's win in the Mountains Classification of the 2005 Tour de France. When Denis Menchov took the lead in the 2005 Vuelta a Espa√±a, he was not expecting to be competing for the overall classification The Rabobank team at that year's Vuelta were not seen as particularly strong <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> assist Menchov in the mountain stages. Menchov finished second to Roberto Heras which was the highest placing of a Rabobank team rider at a grand tour after Michael Boogerd's fifth place in the 1998 Tour de France. Heras was later disqualified for doping and Menchov was made the winner. The following year Menchov focused on the Tour de France where the team rode strongly with Menchov, Boogerd and Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|Revolutionary {{activity}} was fragmented {{because of the}} lack of strong central leadership and guidance. However, the Greek side withstood the Turkish attacks, because, during the same period, the Ottoman military campaigns were periodic, and the Ottoman presence in the rebel areas uncoordinated due to logistical problems. The cash-strapped Ottoman state, whose always difficult relations with Russia had been made worse by the hanging the Patriarch Grigorios, and the Sublime Porte needed to concentrate substantial forces on borders with Russia in case war should break out. From October 1820 to July 1823, the Ottomans were at war with Persia, and in March 1823 a huge fire at the Tophana military arsenal in Constantinople destroyed much of the Ottoman state's supplies of ammunition and its main cannon foundry. Short of men and money, the Ottoman state turned to hiring Albanian tribesmen to fight the Greeks, and by 1823, the bulk of the Ottoman forces in Greece were Albanian mercenaries hired for a campaigning season rather than the Ottoman Army. The Albanian tribesmen, whose style of war was very similar to the Greeks, fought only for money and were liable to go home when not paid <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> plunder in lieu of pay. The Greek military leaders preferred battlefields where they could annihilate the numerical superiority of the opponent, and, at the same time, the lack of artillery hampered Ottoman military efforts.|$|E

[...] King Boleslaw was not as willing <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> assist Izyaslav this time around, and probably for this reason Izyaslav traveled further West; at Mainz in early 1075, Izyaslav sought the aid of King Henry IV of Germany, but to no avail.|$|E
500|$|Florida has enacted laws to {{prohibit}} {{the release of}} exotic animals into the wild.

500|$|The {{majority}} of the city's residents move about Antananarivo on foot. The CUA sets and enforces rules that govern a system of 2,400 franchised private minibuses running [...] on eighty-two numbered routes throughout the city. An additional 2,000 minibuses managed by the Ministry of Transportation run along eight lines into the neighboring suburbs. These interlinked bus systems served around 700,000 passengers each day. These minibuses often fail to meet safety standards or air quality requirements and are typically overcrowded with passengers and their cargo. Police and gendarmes assist in regulating traffic at peak periods {{in the morning and}} evening, or around special events and holidays. Private licensed and unlicensed taxis are common; most vehicles are older Renaults or Citroens.

500|$|... "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 1987 for his seventh studio album Bad, which was released {{the same year}} it {{was recorded}}. Epic Records released the song as the third single from the album in November that year. [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] was written and co-produced by Jackson, and produced by Quincy Jones. Before the recording of Bad, Jackson had written over sixty songs for the album, with plans of releasing a three disc album, but after Jones convinced Jackson to make Bad a one disc LP, [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel", as well as ten other songs were selected for the album. According to Bad 25, the song and subsequent video was intended to show another aspect to public's perception of Michael Jackson {{in addition to his}} reputation as a lover [...] "(I Just Can't Stop Loving You)" [...] and being streetwise ("Bad") they wanted to show him as a flirt <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pick up girls.|$|E
500|$|The {{depictions of}} Mariana by Tennyson and in later works {{are not the}} same. The {{difference}} with Millais's depiction {{is not in the}} image of a forlorn woman or of a woman who is unwilling to live an independent life; instead, it is her sexualised depiction that is greater than found in Tennyson. His version also removes the dreariness of Tennyson's and replaces it with a scene filled with vibrant colours. Gaskell's depiction is of Ruth is similar to Tennyson in her weariness and wanting to die. However, she is a sexually independent figure when she rejects her lover who has returned. Tennyson's character, on the other hand, would likely have happily accepted her lover. While Tennyson's character cannot recognise beauty within nature, Gaskell's character is able to turn to nature to gain spiritually {{in a manner similar to}} the Romantic poems, including [...] "Tintern Abbey" [...] by William Wordsworth or [...] "This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison" [...] by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. There is also a connection with Mariana's condition and the condition within Coleridge's [...] However, the narrator at the end of Dejection is able to be roused into movement whereas Mariana never reaches that point. Furthermore, [...] "Mariana" [...] is unlike the Romantic poems because the character is not one with nature <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> achieve transcendence through imagination. Furthermore, there is little outside of Mariana that exists within the poem as Mariana's mood does not respond to changes in nature.|$|E
