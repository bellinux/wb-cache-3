40|$|According to {{previous}} results, the main variance reduction techniques performed well during the Monte Carlo simulation of Asian calls (Marins, Santos e Saliby, 2003). Control Variate best performed {{in terms of}} the precision of the estimates, whereas Descriptive Sampling was the fastest technique. However, a performance deterioration was noted as the exercise probability of the Asian calls was decreased, or equivalently, as these calls became <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money.</b> In this the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> region, the call exercise becomes a rare event and the simulation process remains injured. One possible solution is to implement Importance Sampling, which is a specific technique to deal with rare event simulation problems. This technique has already performed well in the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> European call simulation case (Saliby, Marins and Santos, 2005). Therefore, the objective {{of this article is to}} use Importance Sampling in the simulation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> Asian calls, in order to verify if the precision of the estimates is preserved. It is also implemented a combination of Importance Sampling with the two previously mentioned best techniques, Control Variate and Descriptive Sampling. According to the main findings, Importance Sampling was not only crucial to allow simulation in the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> region, but also to provide additional precision gains when combined with the two other techniques. ...|$|R

In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{latest project}} is Journey, which was {{released}} on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony, and was developed {{by a team of}} fourteen. This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke. The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected to take one year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe. After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for other opportunities. Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny Speck. Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and {{to the fact that the}} company had run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to pay employees, mandating an unpaid hiatus until the revenue from Journey came in.|$|E
