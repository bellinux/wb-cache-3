DESIGN: We utilized 2 web‐based surveys to examine <b>observation</b> care in the 42 hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We obtained information regarding the designation of <b>observation</b> status, including the criteria used to admit patients into <b>observation.</b> From hospitals reporting the use of <b>observation</b> status, we requested specific details relating to the structures of <b>observation</b> care and the processes of care for <b>observation</b> patients following emergency department treatment. RESULTS: A total of 37 hospitals responded to Survey 1, and 20 hospitals responded to Survey 2. Designated <b>observation</b> units were present in only 12 of 31 (39 %) hospitals that report <b>observation</b> patient data to the Pediatric Health Information System. <b>Observation</b> status was variably {{defined in terms of}} duration of treatment and prespecified criteria. <b>Observation</b> periods were limited to < 48 hours in 24 of 31 (77 %) hospitals. Hospitals reported that various standards were used by different payers to determine <b>observation</b> status reimbursement. <b>Observation</b> care was delivered in a variety of settings. Most hospitals indicated that there were no differences in the clinical care delivered to virtual <b>observation</b> status patients when compared with other inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Observation</b> is a variably applied patient status, defined differently by individual hospitals. Consistency in the designation of patients under <b>observation</b> status among hospitals and payers may be necessary to compare quality outcomes and costs, as well as optimize models of pediatric <b>observation</b> care.
