This paper synthetises a literature survey aimed at comparing the <b>Oscillating</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> modelling methods, from analytical methods to more recent CFD approaches.

In this paper a general control framework for oscillating WECs is presented and a methodology to understand and quantify the wave excitation force prediction requirements, along with the achievable prediction accuracy, is discussed.

At Belfast his major contribution was the invention of a novel turbine for generating electricity from wave-power. The Wells turbine rotates in one direction irrespective of the direction of axial fluid flow driving it and is best suited to devices containing an <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> in which waves force the piston-like motion of a column of water in a chamber with the air above blown and sucked through the Wells turbine.

5000|$|<b>Oscillating</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> (OWCs) are {{a type of}} Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that harness {{energy from}} the {{oscillation}} of the seawater inside a chamber or hollow caused {{by the action of}} waves. OWCs have shown promise as a renewable energy source with low environmental impact. Because of this, multiple companies have been working to design increasingly efficient OWC models. OWC are devies with a semi-submerged chamber or hollow open to the sea below, keeping a trapped air pocket above a <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Waves force the column to act like a piston, moving up and down, forcing the air out of the chamber and back into it. This continuous movement force a bidirectional stream of high-velocity air, which is channelled through a Power-Take-Off (PTO). The PTO system converts the airflow into energy. In models that convert airflow to electricity, the PTO system consists of a bidirectional turbine. This means that the turbine always spins the same direction regardless of the direction of airflow, allowing for energy to be continuously generated. Both the collecting chamber and PTO systems will be explained further under [...] "Basic OWC Components." ...|$|R

The wave induced force is calculated using the boundary element method based on the velocity potential theory. Assuming air to be an ideal gas, the air flow is calculated using an equation of state and the equations of conservation of mass and energy. Boundary integral equations are formulated to calculate the air pressure in the air chambers, the reflection coefficient and the primary conversion efficiency of each of the chambers as well as the combined efficiency. In addition, the behaviour of these physical quantities with the variation of the nozzle ratio, the relative water depth, the depth of the curtain wall and the width of the front-chamber are investigated using the calculated results...|$|R

Two different mathematical models are employed to solve the hydrodynamic problem; the semi-analytic method of matched eigenfunction expansion and the numerical scheme of Boundary Integral Equation Method (BIEM). The numerical results are compared with the semi-analytic results and show good agreement. The effects of the distance between the barriers and the length of the barriers on the efficiency of the OWC device are investigated. The results of two chambers OWC are also compared with the results for an equivalent single OWC chamber. Further, the effect of the water depth on the capacity of the wave power absorption is discussed. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} {{four-stroke}} or two-stroke cycle. [...] Their normal operation was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the <b>oscillating</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate scavenge air valve.|$|E

The hydrodynamic performance of such converters heavily depends on their interactions with ocean waves; therefore, understanding these interactions is essential. In this paper, a fully nonlinear 2 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on RANS equations and VOF surface capturing scheme is implemented to carry out wave energy balance analyses for an offshore OWC. The numerical model is well validated against published physical measurements including; chamber differential air pressure, chamber water level oscillation and vertical velocity, overall wave energy extraction efficiency, reflected and transmitted waves, velocity and vorticity fields (PIV measurements). Following the successful validation work, an extensive campaign of numerical tests is performed to quantify the relevance of three design parameters, namely incoming wavelength, wave height and turbine damping to the device hydrodynamic performance and wave energy conversion process. All of the three investigated parameters show important effects on the wave–pneumatic energy conversion chain.

Following recent controversy, the corresponding three optional expressions are derived, compared and discussed in this paper. They all provide the correct time-average absorbed power. However, only the first-mentioned expression is applicable to quantify the instantaneous absorbed wave power and the associated reactive power. In this connection, new formulae are derived that relate the 'added-mass' matrix, as well as a couple of additional reactive radiation-parameter matrices, to the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy in the water surrounding the immersed oscillating WEC array. Further, a complex collective oscillation amplitude is introduced, which makes it possible to derive, by a very simple algebraic method, various simple expressions for the maximum time-average wave power that may be absorbed by the WEC array. The real-valued time-average absorbed power is illustrated as an axisymmetric paraboloid defined on the complex collective-amplitude plane. This is a simple illustration of the so-called 'fundamental theorem for wave power'. Finally, the paper also presents a new derivation that extends a recently published result on the direction-average maximum absorbed wave power to cases where the WEC array's radiation damping matrix may be singular and where the WEC array may contain OWCs in addition to oscillating bodies...|$|R

Acoustic telemetry was used to study the fine-scale movement patterns of the Broadnose Sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus and its main prey, the Gummy shark Mustelus antarcticus, in a coastal bay of southeast Tasmania.
