Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft {{argues that a}} greater wrong is women's lack of independence.

5|$|Stengel {{had become}} {{famous for his}} humorous and {{sometimes}} disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events {{for the rest of}} his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given good players. Stengel is remembered as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> characters in baseball history.|$|E
