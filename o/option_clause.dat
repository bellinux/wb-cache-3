500|$|The NFLPA {{challenged}} the so-called [...] "Rozelle Rule" [...] {{as a violation}} of federal antitrust laws in a lawsuit filed by president John Mackey and allied union leaders in 1971. The rule, named after commissioner Pete Rozelle, allowed the commissioner to award compensation, which included players, to a team losing a free agent if both the signing team and the team the player was departing could not come to an agreement on compensation. This rule limited player movement, as few teams were willing to sign high-profile free agents only to risk having their rosters raided. With the 1970 CBA agreement set to expire, the players went on strike on July 1, 1974. In addition to the [...] "Rozelle Rule", the players demanded the elimination of the <b>option</b> <b>clause,</b> impartial arbitration of disputes, elimination of the draft and waiver system and individual, rather than uniform contracts.|$|E

Law protects the franchisees and unless they breach the contract, it is difficult to acquire a profitable franchised business unit without resistance. However, it would be different if the franchisor negotiated such terms of acquisition within the contract negotiation process, as the franchisor could include a real <b>options</b> <b>clause</b> in the franchise contract (Gorovaia & Windsperger, 2013). This legal clause could regulate the rights to acquire as well as the price of the acquisition (Kogut, 1991).

5000|$|On June 18, 1921, the NFL {{ratified}} {{its first}} constitution. The reserve clause ratified {{in the constitution}} {{was similar to that}} of baseball's at the time. The reserve clause stipulated that a team had the first opportunity to sign a player after the length of the contract had expired. If the team chose not to offer a contract, then the player could try to sign with a team of his choosing. Theoretically, the reserve clause bound the player [...] "...to his employer in perpetuity". The reserve clause had been abolished in the NFL constitution in 1948 when the <b>option</b> <b>clause</b> was created. The <b>option</b> <b>clause</b> stated that a team may choose to automatically keep a player on their team for another year, at the same pay, after his contract had expired. The term, <b>option</b> <b>clause,</b> was not used by the print media and it was instead referred to as the reserve clause.

5000|$|In {{a record}} contract, options are agreed upon between {{the record company}} and the act. Options allow the label to request {{additional}} albums from the act if they so choose. Major labels tend to ask for more options in a contract than independents. For instance, a contract may state [...] "one album, with an option for four". This would mean {{a total of five}} possible albums. This means that if the first album was recorded and released by the label and was profitable, the label is going to pick up its option for a second album. The act, therefore, must deliver a second album to the label. If that album is successful, the label will pick up its option for a third album; {{and so on and so}} on, depending on how many options are stated in the contract. Picking up the option for another album lies strictly with the label, not the act. The label can pick up as many options as it wants, up to the amount stated in the contract, it does not have to pick up all the options. That means, although a contract may state it has an option for four albums, the label does not have to pick up all four of these options. The reason for this is, say the act's first album is successful and the label picks up an option for a second album, but that second album fails miserably. The label could decide it is not about to spend more money on another album, and not pick up any more options and drop the act from its roster. Another ploy the label could utilize is to pick up an option for another album, even after a failed album had been released. If the label doesn't like the finished product of the new album the act has recorded, the label may not release that album, and then pick up its option for yet another album! The label then may not release that album as well! But the money spent for recording these unreleased albums may still be recoupable from the albums that have already been released. Because the act is under contract with the label, it cannot record music for another record label without permission. This scenario could potentially tie an act down to a label for years, even though the label has no intentions of releasing any more product from this act, in a career that guarantees no success, and if so, typically only sees a few prime years of prosperity. Some acts consider this unfair because the label has the right to not distribute an artist's work, yet legally keep them bound and prevent them from recording elsewhere. In effect, the label could continue to demand more albums through the <b>options</b> <b>clause</b> until it deems one commercially or artistically acceptable. Record labels also effectively own the product recorded (released or not) by an act during the duration of their contract with the label.|$|R
