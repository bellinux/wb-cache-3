5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
