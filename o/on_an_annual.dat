5|$|A charter {{granted in}} 1363 by David II, King of Scots (reigned 1329–71), awarded the burgh {{the right to}} trade across the regality of Dunfermline.

5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>annual</b> cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses.

A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>annual</b> basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>annual</b> basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
