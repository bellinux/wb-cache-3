25|$|As the glycemic index {{measures}} {{the speed at}} which glucose is released into the bloodstream a refined sugar containing glucose is considered high-glycemic. As with <b>other</b> <b>sugars,</b> over-consumption may cause an increase in blood sugar levels from a normal 90mg/dL to up over 150mg/dL. (5mmol/l to over 8.3mmol/l).|$|E
25|$|Starch and {{cellulose}} molecules are {{strings of}} glucose molecules. It {{is also possible}} to generate ethanol out of cellulosic materials. That, however, requires a pretreatment that splits the cellulose into glycose molecules and <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> that subsequently can be fermented. The resulting product is called cellulosic ethanol, indicating its source.|$|E
25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>sugars</b> are not {{fermentable}} at all. After {{consumption by}} the yeast, {{the ratio of}} non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: arabinose and xylose) is between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste – they balance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol.|$|E

25|$|All {{strains of}} S.cerevisiae can grow aerobically on glucose, maltose, and {{trehalose}} {{and fail to}} grow on lactose and cellobiose. However, growth on <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> is variable. Galactose and fructose are shown to be {{two of the best}} fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and trehalose.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>other</b> <b>sugars,</b> sucrose is digested {{into its}} {{components}} via the enzyme sucrase to glucose (blood sugar) and fructose. The glucose component is transported {{into the blood}} (90%) and excess glucose is converted to temporary storage in the liver– named glycogen. The fructose is either bonded to cellulose and transported out the GI tract or processed by the liver into citrates, aldehydes, and, for the most part, lipid droplets (fat).|$|E
25|$|Such {{a special}} role of sucrose in the {{formation}} of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> in the diet, such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.|$|E

50|$|Xylitol is {{categorized}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{as a food}} additive.Like <b>other</b> <b>sugar</b> alcohol-sweetened products, xylitol-sweetened products are allowed to be labeled with the claim {{that they do not}} promote dental cavities.|$|R
25|$|Crystallisation {{experiments}} of galectins {{in complex}} with N-acetyllactosamine show that binding arises due to hydrogen bonding interactions from the carbon-4 and carbon-6 hydroxyl groups of galactose and carbon-3 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) {{to the side}} chains of amino acids in the protein. They cannot bind to <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> such as mannose because this sugar will not fit inside the carbohydrate recognition domain without steric hindrance. Due {{to the nature of}} the binding pocket, galectins can bind terminal sugars or internal sugars within a glycan. This allows bridging between two ligands on the same cell or between two ligands on different cells.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of <b>other</b> <b>sugars,</b> with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also found}} that the rate of trophallactic feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total {{individuals}} in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, {{and the size of the}} overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased. The ants prefer sugar and protein food sources over lipids, and this preference did not change seasonally. When specific sugar sources were studied the ants preferred sucrose over <b>other</b> <b>sugars,</b> such as fructose and glucose.|$|E
50|$|When {{compared}} with <b>other</b> <b>sugar</b> alcohols, {{it is also}} {{much more difficult for}} intestinal bacteria to digest, so it is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol, or lactitol.|$|R

50|$|Sugar Creek Township was {{organized}} in the 1830s, and named after the Sugar Creek which flows through it. Statewide, four <b>other</b> <b>Sugar</b> Creek Townships are located in Allen, Stark, Tuscarawas, and Wayne counties, plus a Sugarcreek Township in Greene County.|$|R
25|$|When two monosaccharides undergo {{dehydration}} synthesis whereby {{a molecule}} {{of water is}} released, as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides, the new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a disaccharide and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed hydrolysis. The most well-known disaccharide is sucrose, ordinary sugar (in scientific contexts, called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from <b>other</b> <b>sugars).</b> Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. As most humans age, the production of lactase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in lactase deficiency, also called lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Adulteration {{of honey}} is the {{addition}} of <b>other</b> <b>sugars,</b> syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. Adulteration of honey is sometimes used {{as a method of}} deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, by 1932, Szent-Györgyi {{had moved}} to Hungary. By that point he knew that hexanuric acid was present in large amounts in citrus, where it {{prevented}} oxidation of polyphenols, but where {{it was difficult to}} extract because of the <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> naturally present there. After being fed a meal of paprika peppers — a common spice and food in the Hungarian diet — Szent-Györgyi was inspired to assay it for hexuronic acid, and found it present in large amounts without the contaminating sugars from sweeter plants. With a plentiful source of the pure vitamin, Szent-Györgyi now sent a large sample to noted British sugar chemist Walter Norman Haworth, who chemically identified it as L-hexuronic acid and then proved the identification by total synthesis in 1933. Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed that the substance L-hexuronic acid be called a-scorbic acid, and chemically L-ascorbic acid, in honor of its activity against scurvy. Ascorbic acid {{turned out not to be}} an amine, nor even to contain any nitrogen. In part, in recognition of his accomplishment with vitamin C, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the unshared 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Haworth also shared that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in part for his vitamin C synthetic work.|$|E

500|$|In {{regard to}} {{contributions}} to tooth decay, {{the role of}} free sugars is also recommended to be below an absolute maximum of 10% of energy intake, {{with a minimum of}} zero. [...] There is [...] "convincing evidence from human intervention studies, epidemiological studies, animal studies and experimental studies, for an association between the amount and frequency of free sugars intake and dental caries" [...] while <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> (complex carbohydrate) consumption is normally associated with a lower rate of dental caries. Lower rates of tooth decay have been seen in individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance.

2500|$|Other {{winemaking}} {{techniques that}} have been at various times considered fraudulent or too manipulative of the wine include chaptalization, fermenting and aging in oak barrels, using oak chips, stirring lees, racking, clarification and filtration, reverse osmosis, cold maceration, the use of cultured instead of wild yeast, cryo-extraction, micro-oxygenation, {{and the addition of}} enzymes, anti-oxidant agents, acids or <b>other</b> <b>sugars</b> that may be used to [...] "balance" [...] the wine.|$|E
2500|$|In both cases, the {{end point}} is a polymer of reduced carbohydrate, (CH2O)n, {{typically}} molecules such as glucose or <b>other</b> <b>sugars.</b> [...] These relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules, including proteins, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, or be respired to perform work. Consumption of primary producers by heterotrophic organisms, such as animals, then transfers these organic molecules (and the energy stored within them) up the food web, fueling all of the Earth's living systems.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that {{a different type of}} nucleic acid, such as PNA, TNA or GNA, was the first to emerge as a self-reproducing molecule, only later replaced by RNA.
