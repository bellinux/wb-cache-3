5|$|Cuthbert was the {{recipient}} of a long letter from Boniface who complained about the lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles, and too much drinking of alcohol by the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England. During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop <b>of</b> <b>York,</b> raising the see <b>of</b> <b>York</b> {{to the status of}} an archbishopric. As a sign of the enhanced status <b>of</b> <b>York,</b> Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England.|$|E

5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke <b>of</b> <b>York</b> was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess <b>of</b> <b>York</b> had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke <b>of</b> <b>York</b> was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E

5|$|Much of Berhtwald's time {{in office}} {{coincided with the}} efforts of Wilfrid to regain the see <b>of</b> <b>York,</b> and to reverse the {{division}} <b>of</b> <b>York</b> into smaller dioceses. Berhtwald was opposed to Wilfrid's desire to restore some separated bishoprics to the bishopric <b>of</b> <b>York</b> as well as regaining his old see. Wilfrid's problems had begun during the archbishopric of Berhtwald's predecessor, Theodore of Tarsus, when Wilfrid had quarreled with the King of Northumbria, Ecgfrith, and was expelled from the north. Theodore had taken the opportunity to divide the large see <b>of</b> <b>York</b> {{into a number of}} smaller dioceses, and Wilfrid had appealed to the papacy in Rome. Berhtwald inherited the dispute and presided at the Council of Austerfield in 702, at which Wilfrid's biographer relates the story that King Aldfrith of Northumbria, Berhtwald, and the other enemies of Wilfrid conspired to deprive Wilfrid of all his offices and possessions. A more likely story is that Berhtwald managed to secure concessions from the Northumbrians, and tried to broker a compromise. The offer in the end was that Wilfrid would retire to Ripon and cease acting as a bishop. Wilfrid rejected this compromise and once more appealed to the pope. Three years later, at a further Council, it was arranged that Wilfrid should receive the Bishopric of Hexham in place of that <b>of</b> <b>York.</b> This was the Council of Nidd, usually dated to 706, and it was held in Northumbria. Bede also mentions that Berhtwald consecrated a number of bishops, including Tobias as Bishop of Rochester.|$|E
