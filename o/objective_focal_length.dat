50|$|Longitudinal {{chromatic}} aberration is a pronounced effect of optical telescope <b>objectives,</b> because the <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> are so long. Microscopes, whose <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> are generally shorter, do not tend {{to suffer from}} this effect.|$|R
2500|$|Telescopes {{built in}} the 17th and early 18th century used single element non-achromatic {{objective}} lenses that suffered from interfering rainbow halos (chromatic aberration) introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of single glass lenses. This degraded {{the quality of the}} images they produced. Telescope makers from that era found that very long <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> <b>objectives</b> had no appreciable chromatic aberration (the uncorrected chromatic aberration fell within the large diffraction pattern at focus). They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the <b>objective's</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> 4 times as long (<b>focal</b> <b>length</b> had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> as long as 150 feet. Besides having very long tubes, these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. [...] Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's support frame and tube flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} have presented a real-time holographic interferometer using sillenite crystals connected with phase-shifting for quantitative measurement of diffuse objects deformations. In our basic set-up, the crystal, sandwiched between two polarizers, {{is set in}} front of the optical head and followed by a CCD camera with an imaging objective. With this system, for conventional objects and using 2. 2 Watts of Ar 3 + laser power @ 514 nm, interferograms can be observed on object fields of about 30 cm* 20 cm (crystal size 1 cm* 1 cm and 26 mm <b>objective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length).</b> In this paper we present investigations to increase the observed field in the existing system {{and to be able to}} use lower power lasers. Since setting the object at larger distances should lead to an insufficient luminous level for hologram recording, we have proceeded by different ways. First, we use shorter focal length objectives, giving a larger field-of-view, and larger crystals have to be used in this case to avoid vignetting. Second, we use a large aperture frontal objective in order to collect more light and that images the object on the crystal, the final image being observed through relay imagery...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} the numerical reconstruction of the complete wavefront properties from a single digital hologram: the amplitude, the phase and the polarization state. For this purpose, we present the principle of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) and the numerical reconstruction process which consists of propagating numerically a wavefront from the hologram plane to the reconstruction plane. We then define the different parameters of a Numerical Parametric Lens (NPL) introduced in the reconstruction plane that should be precisely adjusted to achieve a correct reconstruction. We demonstrate that automatic procedures not only allow to adjust these parameters, but in addition, to completely compensate for the phase aberrations. The method consists in computing directly from the hologram a NPL defined by standard or Zernike polynomials without prior knowledge of physical setup values (microscope <b>objective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> distance between the object and the objective [...] .). This method enables to reconstruct correct and accurate phase distributions, even {{in the presence of}} strong and high order aberrations. Furthermore, we show that this method allows to compensate for the curvature of specimen. The NPL parameters obtained by Zernike polynomial fit give quantitative measurements of micro-optics aberrations and the reconstructed images reveal their surface defects and roughness. Examples with micro-lenses and a metallic sphere are presented. Then, this NPL is introduced in the hologram plane and allows, as a system of optical lenses, numerical magnification, complete aberration compensation in DHM (correction of image distortions and phase aberrations) and shifting. This NPL can be automatically computed by polynomial fit, {{but it can also be}} defined by a calibration method called Reference Conjugated Hologram (RCH). We demonstrate the power of the method by the reconstruction of non-aberrated wavefronts from holograms recorded specifically with high orders aberrations introduced by a tilted thick plate, or by a cylindrical lens or by a lens ball used instead of the microscope objective. Finally, we present a modified digital holographic microscope permitting the reconstruction of the polarization state of a wavefront. The principle consists in using two reference waves polarized orthogonally that interfere with an object wave. Then, the two wavefronts are reconstructed separately from the same hologram and are processed to image the polarization state in terms of Jones vector components. Simulated and experimental data are compared to a theoretical model in order to evaluate the precision limit of the method for different polarization states of the object wave. We apply this technique to image the birefringence and the dichroism induced in a stressed polymethylmethacrylate sample (PMMA), in a bent optical fiber and in a thin concrete specimen. To evaluate the precision of the phase difference measurement in DHM design, the birefringence induced by internal stress in an optical fiber is measured and compared to the birefringence profile captured by a standard method, which had been developed to obtain high-resolution birefringence profiles of optical fibers. A 6 degrees phase difference resolution is obtained, comparable with standard imaging polariscope, but with the advantage of a single acquisition allowing real-time reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{microsurgery}} using microneedles is a {{very useful}} technique for the developmental biologist. However, there are some limitations imposed on this technique because of both practical physical considerations and the time required for an operation. Very elaborate equipment {{is necessary for the}} most delicate work {{and the nature of the}} equipment is such that the variety of usable experimental material is somewhat limited. Work with microneedles at the tissue level is often a difficult proposition and the necrosis of cells adjacent to a puncture can be a difficult problem to overcome with certain types of material. At the levels requiring greatest precision even the micromanipulator has one serious limitation in plant micrurgy. In order to perform an intracellular operation, one must first alter the integrity of the plant cell wall. With the advent of the laser beam a new approach to micro­surgery was suggested. Laser microsurgery showed great promise as a supplement to conventional techniques. The possibility of using focused laser light as a tissue, cell or organelle disrupting agent suggested immediate application to studies in cytology and developmental biology. Theoretical considera­tions showed that one could expect to have a range of destruc­tive capability from altered volumes of material at the cubic micron level up past altered volumes of the order of cubic centimeters. The unusual properties of the laser light might even allow one to perform an operation on material surrounded by other material without affecting the intervening material. Before such research could be attempted it was necessary to design a system whereby one might align target material for a predetermined operation and observe the effects. This necessitated an extensive study of the properties of laser light and the application of these with respect to a given physical system designed for a specific range of operations. Thus, an instrumentation had to be developed and a technique evolved for practical use of the laser in studies of a cytol­ogical nature. It was very important that the overall limit­ations of the technique be defined. Prior to this, the nature of the laser effects had to be determined and the relative contributions of the controllable variables to producing an effect had to be ascertained. A description of all the com­ponents of the system was required as well as a description of the reproducible effects obtained with living material. With the instrumentation and techniques established, it was also desired to demonstrate the applicability of laser microsurgery to the solution of a purely biological problem with a view to demonstrating the ease and versatility of this new technique. A "model tissue" used to determine the relative contributions of energy input, <b>objective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and degree of defocusing In producing a laser effect was found to be of great utility In this work. Thus, three distinct re­searches were undertaken: the development of the instrument­ation, the study of the laser effects and the solution of a biological problem using the laser technique. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the work, an elaboration of laser action and the properties of laser light as related to their application is introduced at this point...|$|E
