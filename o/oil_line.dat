25|$|At {{the end of}} March 2001 Antonov's first deputy designer-general Dmitri Kiva {{provided}} {{further details}} about the cause announcing that the accident was caused by disintegration of the <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> leading to the propeller hub pitch mechanism that attaches to the engine. Kiva said that the pilots attempted {{to compensate for the}} loss of power by increasing the settings of the remaining three engines. At some point another D-27 automatically shut off after the safe RPM limit has been exceeded.|$|E

50|$|Drag {{reducing}} agents can be broadly classified {{under the}} following four categories - Polymers, Solid-particle suspensions, Biological additives, and Surfactants. These agents are made out of high molecular weight polymers or micellar systems. The polymers help with drag reduction by decreasing turbulence in the <b>oil</b> <b>lines.</b> This allows for oil to be pumped through at lower pressures, saving energy and money. Although these drag reducing agents are mostly used in <b>oil</b> <b>lines,</b> there is research being done to see how helpful polymers could be in reducing drag in veins and arteries.|$|R

500|$|Raphel's {{emphasis}} on providing Pakistan with military aid, siding with Pakistan on Kashmir issue {{and construction of}} <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> in Afghanistan for supply to Pakistan made her unpopular within the Indian establishment, despite being stationed in New Delhi in her early career. Her characterization in her capacity as {{an official of the}} State Department of Kashmir as disputed territory and her lobbying for separatists in Jammu and Kashmir when she was stationed there made her a target of criticism in India. Her official position on the topic was overshadowed by off-the-record comments in which she questioned whether India's territorial integrity might not be changed by seeking self-determination rights for Kashmiris. Raphel also sided with Sikh separatists and persuaded Clinton to support them. She was seen in New Delhi as a catalyst for Washington's [...] "trafficking with India's enemies".|$|E

Leif Erickson Drive, a road closed to motorized traffic, runs at lower elevation than and roughly parallel to the Wildwood Trail for about [...] {{from the end of}} Northwest Thurman Street to Northwest Germantown Road. Originally called Hillside Drive, it was renamed in 1933 {{at the request of the}} Sons of Norway, a fraternal organization. Easements for an <b>oil</b> <b>line,</b> a gas line, and electric transmission lines for the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) cross the park.

500|$|Though {{the flight}} spotted no Chinese, at 14:40 Koenig radioed to Brown that he {{appeared}} to be trailing fuel. The damage had likely come by small arms fire from Chinese infantry, who were known to hide in the snow and ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison. At least one bullet had ruptured an <b>oil</b> <b>line.</b> Brown, losing oil pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft, dropped his external fuel tanks and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow-covered clearing {{on the side of a}} mountain. Brown crashed into a bowl-shaped valley at approximately , near Somong-ni, [...] behind Chinese lines and in 15-degree weather. The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed. In the crash, Brown's leg was pinned beneath the fuselage of the Corsair, and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself, before waving to the other pilots, who were circling close overhead. Hudner and the other airborne pilots thought Brown had died in the crash, and they immediately began a mayday radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain for any sign of nearby Chinese ground forces. They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible, but Brown's aircraft was smoking and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks.|$|E
2500|$|A report {{released}} by the investigation team in mid-March, by Ukrainian [...] "Aviation and Time" [...] magazine, provided preliminary details into the cause. According to the report, immediately after take-off one of the engines was automatically shut off by its electronic safeguards after it exceeded the safe RPM limit. The front set of blades of the contra rotating propeller assembly stopped but the aft [...] part of the propeller assembly continued turning due to the damaged <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> that powered the blade actuators. This caused the negative air flow estimated at 5,000kg/11,023lbs. of thrust.|$|E

The most serious accident occurred to YFM-1A (Model 8) 38-497, on a flight between Chanute Field, Illinois, and Keesler Field, Mississippi, when a broken <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> started a fire. The cause of the broken line appeared to be serious airframe vibration encountered during the flight. With no way of extinguishing the fire, both the pilot and crew chief agreed to bail out. The pilot was killed when his parachute failed to deploy (he may have struck the tail while bailing out). This was the only fatality to occur during the flying of Airacudas. The accident investigation report stated [...] "inherent defects in design caused constant maintenance difficulties and the flying of this type has been very limited." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{spectacular}} project, {{dubbed the}} Canol Road â€“ a contraction of [...] "Canadian" [...] and [...] "oil" [...] â€“ took 20 months, 25,000 men, 10 million tonnes (9.8 million long tons or 11 million short tons) of equipment, [...] each of road, and telegraph line and [...] of pipeline.

The test for the Norman Wells oil field came when the pipeline was ready on February 16, 1944. The field surpassed expectations. During the one year remaining of the Pacific war, the field produced about 160,000 mÂ³ (1.4 million barrels) of oil.|$|E
