5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the <b>Overfall</b> he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The main {{job of the}} Drain is {{to gather}} the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, {{alongside}} the Bourne Eau and River Glen, northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The <b>overfall</b> weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E
25|$|With {{few options}} left, the Commissioners built a steam pumping station at Arram Beck in 1868. This was not successful, as the low {{banks of the}} Hull meant {{that there was little}} spare capacity, and the pumped water would often return to the drain because of the <b>overfall</b> near Grovehill. Next they {{suggested}} to the Holderness Drainage that if they jointly dredged the Hull, they could use the mud to raise the banks {{on both sides of the}} river, but the Driffield Navigation objected, and little dredging took place. Finally, the impasse was broken in 1880. The Commissioners obtained a new Act of Parliament, which allowed them to dredge the river from the Driffield Navigation to the Old Harbour. They had to alter the lock at Hempholme, to allow for the lower water levels, but the restrictions on the height of the banks and the necessity of the <b>overfall,</b> imposed by the 1798 Act, were removed. By early 1883, most of the dredging had been done and the banks had been raised. The Arram Beck pumping station, and another at Hempholme, started working, and further south, the new river levels enabled a new steam pumping station to be erected at Dunswell by the Beverley and Skidby Drainage. Regular flooding of the Beverley and Barmston level was effectively ended.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, the engineer, William Jessop was engaged by the Bristol Dock Company to create a {{non-tidal}} Floating Harbour to combat continuing problems with ships being grounded at low tide. With his system, which was completed in 1809, water was trapped behind lock gates so ships could remain floating at all times, unaffected {{by the state of}} the tide on the river. Part of the project included building a dam at the Underfall Yard with a weir, known as the <b>overfall,</b> to allow surplus river water to flow into the New Cut, an excavation that by-passed the Floating Harbour and joined the River Avon near Temple Meads.|$|E
25|$|The Beverley and Barmston Drain was straighter {{and larger}} than the Holderness Drain, and only carried lowland water. It was {{therefore}} more efficient at draining the Beverley and Barmston level, but it still did {{not solve the problem}} of flooding entirely. One factor was the limits placed on the height of the banks, and in particular the <b>overfall.</b> Another was the difficulties of embanking the tributaries on the Hull, several of which were fed by powerful springs. A third factor was the development of the Driffield Navigation. Its enabling Act specified the maximum water level above the lock at Hempholme, but this was frequently exceeded, resulting in flooding and the surrounding ground becoming waterlogged. Despite the risks, much of the level was ploughed and used to grow crops of barley, oats and wheat, although some of the lowest parts were retained as parture. In common with other drainage schemes, the land levels fell as the peat soils dried out, resulting in increasing difficulties in keeping the carrs free from water. However, opposition from the Port of Hull to making cuts to the Humber waned after 1810, as additional docks were constructed, and the importance of the Old Harbour declined, while a period of agricultural decline from 1815 to 1830 resulted in there being no funds for any improvements to the drainage scheme during this period.|$|E

2500|$|In {{place of}} the <b>Overfall</b> he {{constructed}} three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice, between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel, known as a drag boat, to scrape the silt away from the quay walls. Sluices 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while sluice 3 [...] ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep sluice is opened at low tide, a powerful undertow is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. In March 1988, the sluice control was computerised and automated.|$|E
2500|$|The Beverley and Barmston Drainage Act {{was finally}} {{obtained}} in 1798, and work began. William Chapman, who had produced {{a report in}} 1796, was engaged as Chief Engineer, and oversaw the construction of [...] of drainage cuts, [...] or embankments to contain the River Hull, and the [...] long Barmston cut. At the southern end, an outfall sluice into the Hull was constructed, and the main channel required 11 tunnels to carry it under existing waterways. 27 road bridges were required, {{as well as several}} occupation bridges, together with numerous culverts. The cost of the project {{by the time it was}} completed in 1810 was £115,000, and it gave protection to some [...] of land. The resident engineer for the project was William Settle, and Thomas Dyson was the main contractor for the outfall sluice and the tunnel under Beverley Beck. At the northern end of the Hull valley, various channels were made deeper, and the Barmston cut carried water to the sea at Barmston. A barrier was constructed at Foston on the Wolds to prevent water from north Holderness which had previous drained westwards to the Hull from doing so, and this part of the project was known as Sea End, and became a separate drainage region. The [...] of lower banks, required to satisfy the Holderness Drainage and known as the <b>overfall,</b> were built near Grovehill, at the southern end of the level.|$|E

She was then moved to <b>Overfalls,</b> Delaware, where she was stationed from 1926 to 1951 as <b>Overfalls.</b> In 1939 when the United States Lighthouse Service was absorbed into the United States Coast Guard she was reclassified WAL-524, but still kept a station name on her hull. During World War II the vessel was not armed, however many other lightships were. In 1951 LV-101/WAL 524 was reassigned to Stonehorse Shoal, Massachusetts, where she served until decommissioned in 1963.

50|$|The dam {{measures}} 793 ft in length, with an <b>overfall</b> {{area that}} is 169 ft long. The embankments are 20 ft wide, with a core of granite rubble laid in cement. The <b>overfall</b> area is topped with cut granite, and originally had wooden flashboards held in by pins. The gatehouse is a 1-1/2 story granite structure, designed by Boston city architect George Clough. Located {{at the southern end}} of the <b>overfall,</b> it houses one end of the Sudbury Aqueduct extension pipe from Farm Pond, a 4 ft pipe connecting this reservoir to numbers 2 and 3, and gates for channeling water either into the aqueduct or into the river. The gates allowed water to be selectively channeled from any of the reservoirs (1, 2, or 3) into the Sudbury Aqueduct or into the river below the dam. There are also flood gates and equipment for moving the dam's flashboards. Today the gatehouse, Sudbury Aqueduct, and the pipes from reservoir number 3 remain part of MWRA's emergency systems. If activated the water from reservoir number 3 flows from the dam number 1 gatehouse down the Sudbury Aqeuduct extension pipe to a gatehouse at Farm Pond where it enters the Sudbury Aqueduct proper which in turn brings the water to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.|$|E
