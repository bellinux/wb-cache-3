5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> maritime plain could be maintained far from base.

5|$|As {{the cars}} arrived in 1978 and 1979 Amtrak {{employed}} them on short-haul routes radiating from Chicago. The first coaches entered regular service on February 26, 1979, running from Chicago to Milwaukee. The coaches, {{led by an}} EMD F40PH locomotive, displaced the regular Turboliner equipment. The equipment continued to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run for several weeks. The Illini and Shawnee trains received Superliner coaches soon after; the first Superliner dining car ran on the Shawnee as a lounge.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line {{for which they were}} designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E

5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on Line 1 of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The town {{grew up as}} a {{river port}} at the {{confluence}} of the Thames and the Kennet. Both of these rivers are navigable, and Caversham Lock, Blake's Lock, County Lock, Fobney Lock and Southcote Lock are all within the borough.

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> national rail network once more.|$|E

5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held {{a monopoly on}} these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{passenger}} facilities, Wood Siding was {{the starting point for}} the first passenger service to <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. On 26 August 1871 an excursion service ran from Wood Siding to London hauled by the Great Western Railway (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of 105 passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood Siding and Quainton Road and by locomotive from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30am GWR service via Princes Risborough to London, arriving at 10.00am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches along the route posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in the week before the excursion. The day itself was extremely rainy, and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return train from London to Quainton Road was delayed in Slough, and the excursion eventually arrived back at Wood Siding at 2.00am.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway.

The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western part of the network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
