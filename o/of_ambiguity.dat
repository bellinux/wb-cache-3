5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use <b>of</b> <b>ambiguity,</b> symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal <b>of</b> <b>ambiguity</b> about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

25|$|Instances <b>of</b> <b>ambiguity</b> can be {{classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress {{who was on the}} balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E
40|$|A {{key issue}} with GNSS carrier phase {{ambiguity}} resolution is that often the full set <b>of</b> <b>ambiguities</b> cannot be fixed fast and reliably. A possible strategy is then to resolve only a subset <b>of</b> <b>ambiguities,</b> one {{for which the}} probability of correct fixing, the so-called success rate, is sufficiently close to 1. However, a proper subset selection criterion is still lacking. This criterion should {{on the one hand}} guarantee an acceptably high success rate, {{and at the same time}} result in a significant performance improvement with respect to the remaining parameters, like the baseline parameters. The second requirement is important and has not yet been addressed in literature. As an extreme example consider the case where the float ambiguities are not correlated with the other float parameters. Ambiguity resolution would then be useless, since it will then not allow for an improvement of these other parameters. This indicates that resolving a subset <b>of</b> <b>ambiguities</b> (in the extreme example, an empty subset) may lead to the same, or almost same, performance improvement of the other parameters, notably the baseline solution. This contribution presents two approaches to subset selection, where both the requirements on success rate and performance improvement are taken into account. With this approach the user can set a threshold for the success rate to be obtained. It will be shown how much better the baseline solution will be after reliable fixing of the subset <b>of</b> <b>ambiguities.</b> Geoscience & Remote SensingCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
