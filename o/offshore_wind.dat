5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind.</b> One example is the Carbon Trust <b>Offshore</b> <b>Wind</b> Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> {{power is}} {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 1,662 {{turbines}} at 55 <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> {{farms in}} 10 European countries produced 18 TWh, enough to power almost five million households. As of August 2013 the London Array in the United Kingdom {{is the largest}} <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm {{in the world at}} 630 MW. This is followed by Gwynt y Môr (576 MW), also in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Siemens and Vestas are {{the leading}} turbine {{suppliers}} for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power. DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.ON {{are the leading}} offshore operators. As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to BTM Consult, more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed {{before the end of}} 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the US.|$|E

5|$|As the Senator for Cape Cod, Wolf {{supports}} Cape Wind, {{a project}} to build an <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm in Nantucket Sound. In 2011, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships praised Wolf's company Cape Air for efficient initiatives such as installing a major solar panel system at their headquarters, expanding office recycling, and distributing compact fluorescent light bulbs to employees.|$|E
50|$|Cross-shore and cross-onshore {{winds are}} the best for kiteboarding. <b>Offshore</b> <b>winds</b> pose the danger of being blown away from the shore {{in the event of}} {{equipment}} failure or loss of control. <b>Offshore</b> <b>winds</b> are suitable in a lake or when a safety boat is available, however they are generally more gusty. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land, and are thus less favorable.|$|R
50|$|Swells are {{generated}} far south {{and most of}} the spots get consistent <b>offshore</b> <b>winds.</b> The large number of surf spots make it easy to find uncrowded waves.|$|R
25|$|Different onshore and {{off shore}} wind {{patterns}} in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and {{are more suitable for}} experienced surfers. Light <b>offshore</b> <b>winds</b> create smoother waves, while strong direct <b>offshore</b> <b>winds</b> cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.|$|R
5|$|In {{both their}} native and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{proposal}} {{of building the}} biggest <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power production facility {{in the world in}} southwestern Spain in the coast of Cádiz, on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area, and because the area is a war grave.|$|E
5|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power {{refers to}} the {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E

40|$|<b>Offshore</b> {{floating}} <b>wind</b> turbines {{represent the}} future of wind energy. However, significant challenges must be overcome before these systems can be widely used. Because {{of the dynamics of}} <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbines [...] surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw [...] and the resulting interactions between the rotor and generated wake, the aerodynamic analysis methods and design codes that have found wide use throughout the wind energy industry may be inadequate. Application of these techniques to <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbine aerodynamics may result in off-optimal designs, effectively handicapping these next-generation systems, thereby minimizing their full potential. This dissertation will demonstrate that the aerodynamics of <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbines are sufficiently different from conventional <b>offshore</b> and onshore <b>wind</b> turbines, warranting the use of higher fidelity analysis approaches. It will outline the development and validation of a free vortex wake code, the Wake Induced Dynamics Simulator, or WInDS, which uses a more physically realistic Lagrangian approach to modeling complex rotor-wake interactions. Finally, results from WInDS simulations of various <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbines under different load conditions will be presented. The simulation results indicate that <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbine aerodynamics are more complex than conventional <b>offshore</b> or onshore <b>wind</b> turbines and require higher fidelity analysis approaches to model adequately. Additionally, platform pitching modes appear to drive the most aerodynamically-significant motions, followed by yawing modes. Momentum balance approaches are shown to be unable to accurately model these dynamic systems, and the associated dynamic inflow methods respond to velocity changes at the rotor incorrectly. Future <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbine designs should strive to either minimize platform motions or be complementarily optimized, via higher fidelity aerodynamic analysis techniques, to account for them. It is believed that this dissertation is the first in-depth study of <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> turbine aerodynamics and the applicability of various analysis methods...|$|R
50|$|The Popoyo Surf Zone is {{a miracle}} of points, beach and reef breaks that capture {{the power of the}} {{frequent}} south swells and adds an all day dose of <b>offshore</b> <b>winds</b> funneling in from Lake Nicaragua to create great surf.|$|R
5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power in}} Scotland is the country's fastest growing {{renewable}} energy technology, with 5587 MW of installed capacity as of 2015. The Robin Rigg Wind Farm is a 180 MW development completed in April 2010, which is Scotland's first <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm, sited on a sandbank in the Solway Firth.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} and fall, strong <b>offshore</b> <b>winds</b> {{periodically}} develop. These winds are an especially dangerous fire hazard in the fall when vegetation is at its driest, as exemplified historically by the 1923 Berkeley Fire and the 1991 Oakland Firestorm.|$|R

5|$|In 2006 Drax Power Limited, in {{response}} to a government consultation, stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage (CCS), but noted that it was not then commercially viable, with costs comparable with nuclear or <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power. On 17 June 2009, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans to require all UK coal-fired power stations should be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure.|$|E
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} <b>offshore</b> <b>wind,</b> are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") {{have proven to be}} controversial.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher.
