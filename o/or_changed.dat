5|$|As {{there is}} no {{definitive}} date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete. His total bouts and results presently stand, as listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 loses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is accepted that this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future, <b>or</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the rounds}} before the final, the venue of each match is {{determined}} when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is named {{the home team}} and chooses the venue for the match, usually its own home ground. The venue may be switched {{to that of the}} away team <b>or</b> <b>changed</b> to a neutral venue for security reasons such as being unable to host a club with a large travelling fan base or the venue being unavailable.|$|E
5|$|It {{may not be}} {{possible}} to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (<4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, <b>or</b> <b>changed.</b> For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.|$|E

5|$|After the Colts {{left the}} AFC East in 2002, {{they first met}} on November 30, 2003, in a 38–34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots. The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, then won twice in 2006; in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21–6 halftime lead; the game lead tied <b>or</b> <b>changed</b> seven times {{in the second half}} before a late {{touchdown}} led to a 38–34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8–0 Patriots and the 7–0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24–20. The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31–28 Patriots win.|$|E
5|$|Ruislip parish {{was owned}} by the Benedictine Bec Abbey of Normandy between 1096 and 1404 during which time the prior built a home for himself on the site, {{surrounded}} by a moat. During the 16th century, {{the remains of the}} motte-and-bailey site were used as the gardens of the Manor Farm House when it was built. In 1888 the moat extension was filled in by Henry James Ewer, who farmed on the site. The moat's shape and the presence of traces of a fortified building have allowed this part of the site to be dated to the 11th century. However, the castle {{is believed to have been}} built around 1066 then either demolished <b>or</b> <b>changed</b> significantly as it does not appear as a castle in Domesday Book.|$|E
5|$|The Tales series {{originated}} when Phantasia began production, {{based on}} an unpublished novel titled , written by the game's scenario writer and lead programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda. During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped <b>or</b> <b>changed.</b> The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco (then Namco). Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led {{to most of the}} Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the Tales series.|$|E

5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated {{that there are only}} a few thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring for over a century following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed <b>or</b> <b>changed</b> areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose {{to the position of}} a military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath many of them were slain <b>or</b> <b>changed</b> their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that {{little is known about the}} Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E
