5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human.

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents move in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to {{the high cost of}} maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

Analysis by Robbie de Santos and Toby Lloyd of Shelter, also detailed in a report launched today, shows that overall affordability is a bigger problem than the big deposits required by mortgage lenders. Easy finance into a supply constrained market can only boost up house prices, pushing them further <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach for <b>the</b> millions <b>of</b> lower and middle income households already frozen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market...|$|R
