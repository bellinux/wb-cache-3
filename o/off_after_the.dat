5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi V-150 armored personnel carrier.|$|E
5|$|Born Wei Junluo, Shangguan Yunzhu fled to Shanghai {{when her}} {{hometown}} Jiangyin {{was attacked by}} the Japanese. In Shanghai she became a drama and film actress, and her career took <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. She starred in several prominent leftist films such as Spring River Flows East, Crows and Sparrows, and Women Side by Side. After the Communist victory in mainland China in 1949, her career was set back when her husband was embroiled in the anti-capitalist Five-anti Campaign, but she later portrayed {{a wide variety of}} characters in many films.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} was written <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> accident. Immediately after the accident, Widerøe paid a compensation of NOK10,000 {{to each of}} the survivors. The survivors and the deceased's next-of-kin claimed damages for several million NOK, including three people who each demanded over one million after becoming disabled. The demands were raised against the insurance company Norsk Flyforsikringspool. After mediation, the airline agreed to compensate the passengers with an additional NOK15,000 in cash and NOK30,000 worth of free travel with Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|The match started badly with an {{incident}} in the first minute of play, a tackle by Leeds striker Allan Clarke bringing down Phil Thompson who needed treatment. Clarke was then a marked man and was twice fouled badly himself, first by Tommy Smith and then by Alec Lindsay.

5|$|After 15:00 an airstrike {{was called}} in to {{dislodge}} the surviving Chinese in front of D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company's long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault; however, unaffected by the napalm, they broke up the Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March Major General James Cassels {{took over}} {{command of the}} division. The next action {{involving}} the division was over the night of 2/3April, when units of the Irgun attacked railway installations in the divisional area. While one attack on the Yibna railway station and police post was in progress, a mobile patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion arrived, detonating a mine while crossing a bridge. Three of the patrol were wounded, but the others took <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> saboteurs. Reinforcements arrived from the 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions. In the morning, tracks of around thirty men were discovered leading away from the area. A spotter plane later located the men and directed {{a section of the}} 8th Parachute Battalion to intercept them. After a small battle, fourteen of the saboteurs were wounded and twenty-six prisoners taken.|$|E

5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century, levelling <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> famine of 1595, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century. Calculations based on Hearth Tax returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously effected by the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.|$|E
5|$|From January 14 to 19, 2014, Guerrero {{worked his}} first Fantastica Mania tour, co-produced by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan. On March 28, 2014, Guerrero, Euforia and Niebla Roja {{defeated}} Los Estetas del Aire (Máscara Dorada, Místico and Valiente) for the CMLL World Trios Championship. On August 29, Guerrero defeated La Sombra {{in the finals}} to win the 2014 Universal Championship, becoming the first two-time winner of the tournament. On September 19, Guerrero lost to Atlantis in the main event of the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show and thus was forced to unmask {{for the first time}} in his career and reveal his birth name; José Gutiérrez Hernández. In January 2015, Guerrero returned to Japan to take part in the Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, during which he defeated Atlantis in a rematch. On February 13, Los Guerreros Laguneros lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.).

5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went <b>off</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent <b>off.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
