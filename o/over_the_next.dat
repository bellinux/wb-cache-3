5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} depression, eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. Hernan developed {{out of a}} tropical wave that formed off {{the east coast of}} Africa on July 24. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> week, the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2. The wave became better organized <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> several days and was declared Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 6. The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan steadily intensified <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina was {{the only}} named {{tropical}} cyclone to develop within the South Pacific basin during the 1990–91 season. The system was first noted as a shallow depression within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the west of}} Wallis Island. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three days the system moved towards the west-northwest, before it was named Sina during November 24, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> couple of days the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji. Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160km (100mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.|$|E
