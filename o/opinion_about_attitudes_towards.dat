40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to find the seeds of Czech {{interest}} in the topic of female genital mutilation using a spectrum of approaches, {{as well as the}} experience of experts on this topic. The research consists of two main parts. The first part is devoted to the mapping of the institutional network; the second one to personal stories. Interviews with narrators have been analyzed using the method of triple coding. Themes that reveal the narrators' <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> female genital mutilation have been explored in the analysis in particular. In terms of theoretical approaches, the thesis explores whether it is possible to frame the debate on female genital mutilation in the Czech context using the various theses of global feminism and whether there is a general interest in this issue and its solutions. Key words: female genital mutilation, global and multicultural feminism, postcolonial feminism, institutional network, gender order, global North, global Sout...|$|R
40|$|In late October, 2012, the United States {{was hit by}} a “superstorm ” Sandy and President Barack Obama was {{presented}} with a challenge {{in the midst of the}} last leg of the presidential election campaign that could have had an impact to either make or break his re-election as the head of the nation. The purpose of the present thesis is to examine President Barack Obama's crisis communication strategies and tactics during the crisis induced by Hurricane Sandy at the end of October 2012. The research concentrates on the President's selected crisis communication strategies and tactics in the context of the presidential election that were only about a week away when the hurricane struck. Exploring this subject matter is believed to be valuable because it was the first major crisis the President had to manage and, because it happened during the last leg of the election campaign, the natural disaster could be seen to entail some political implications. Therefore, the President's communication and management during the crisis might be viewed as forming <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> him that could have influenced the election results...|$|R
40|$|The major {{body of the}} {{literature}} about individuals’ left-right orientation assumes that individuals’ values and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> different issues will, besides other factors, determine {{their position in the}} left-right dimension. Regarding values, it is assumed that these are stable over (a long period of) time and hence, affect individuals’ left-right orientation. But as issue preferences change over time, cross-nationally and in their importance for individuals, the relationship between issues and left-right orientation is less clear. We argue and show with data from the European Social Survey (2002 / 03) of the Netherlands that the relationship between the <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> or the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> issues and left-right orientation is moderated by issue salience which means the importance people assign to the issues.

For this purpose 508 pedagogic formation students from Çankırı Karatekin University and Hacettepe University participated in the study. Participants filled in the “Scale for Proficiency Self-Efficacy Beliefs” and “Scale for Attitudes toward Teaching Profession”. Both of the scales were checked for whether they are valid and reliable. To investigate if the scales were valid, confirmatory factor analysing was used and seen that the both scale is valid. In order to understand whether the scales are reliable, Cronbach alpha coefficient were calculated and detected that the both scales are reliable. Collected data from the participants were firstly analysed with descriptive statistical techniques including arithmetical means, standard deviations and the value of percentage. To examine the relationship between <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> teaching profession and profession self-efficacy beliefs Pearson correlation coefficient were used. To examine if the self–efficacy beliefs is the significant predictor of the <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the teaching profession multiple regression was used. Results showed that participants' <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the teaching profession are positive. Besides this, it was seen that participants' self-efficacy beliefs on profession is relatively high. Correlation analyses indicated that there is low, positively and significant relations between proficiency self-efficacy beliefs and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> teaching profession. Regression results revealed that proficiency self-efficacy is a significant predictor of the <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the teaching profession. However, it was observed that proficiency self-efficacy beliefs explain the little portion of the variance in <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> teaching profession...|$|R

Using a social-psychological approach that views terrorism as a violent manifestation of intergroup behaviour, this project aims to identify contextual and psychological predictors of support for (and opposition to) political violence among British Muslims. This mixed-methods research was conducted in four interrelated phases: Qualitative interviews of British Muslims. An online pilot survey of British Muslims. A multi-level face-to-face survey conducted by a professional survey company. Interviews were conducted in 66 Double Output Areas with a Muslim penetration of 10 per cent or more, which were randomly drawn from a sample frame stratified by Muslim penetration, Government Office Region, and Index of Multiple Deprivation. A follow-up telephone survey. Respondents in Wave 1 who had agreed to be contacted again (48 per cent) were approached approximately {{five months after the}} first interview. Further information is available on the ESRC Social-psychological Predictors of Support for Terrorism: A Multi-level Analysis webpage. Main Topics : The qualitative semi-structured interview transcripts covered the following themes: religion, British identity, social inclusion, interest in politics, political efficacy, political engagement, views on political violence and counter-terrorism. The pilot survey covered the following topics: religion, nationality, views on politics, views about living in Great Britain, your <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> global affairs, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> violence and basic demographic information. The multi-level face-to-face survey covered the following topics: identity, political engagement and efficacy, contact experiences, appraisals of local and global injustices (including foreign policy attitudes), emotions, and political violence support (against civilian and military targets). The follow-up telephone survey covered the following topics: key constructs relating to identity, political efficacy and engagement, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> political violence. As data collection took place shortly after the general election, questions related to voting and reactions to the outcome of the election were also included...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{traditional}} {{role as an}} enabler of knowledge dissemination, education is expected to contribute substantially {{to the development of}} the knowledge economy. This means applying the knowledge that it generates through research to its own practice. Yet the literature shows that school practitioners do not express much demand for research findings, unlike doctors, engineers and other professionals. The purpose of this pan-Canadian online survey study is twofold. First, it investigates the extent to which school teachers, principals and professionals use research to inform their practice and indicates predictors of this use. Second, it tests the generalizability of a questionnaire originally developed within a provincial secondary school context. The 43 -item questionnaire yielded 1, 153 responses. Frequency of use of research-based information from a variety of sources and types of use were used as outcome measures. The questionnaire also explored practitioners' <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> research, their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> research-awareness activities and their expertise to use research findings, as well as the constraints they contend with in everyday practice:- The results indicate that the three groups of practitioners either do not use educational research or use it infrequently. Although the respondents share neutral <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> research, their comments add a negative connotation by qualifying research as irrelevant, and biased. The latent factor <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> research is the greatest predictor, accounting for 9 - 16 % of the variance in practitioners' use of research. The psychometric qualities of the questionnaire remain stable. Its internal reliability is 0. 94. The four-factor solution explains 60 % of variance and together with demographic variables predicts 22 % of the frequency of use of research-based information. School leadership organizations, teacher education institutions and research-generating bodies stand to benefit from the study's findings, as they point to the necessity of increasing research relevance and accessibility, cultivating teaching as a research-based profession and building school capacity to use research. Future research should further explore the reasons why practitioners do not use research-based information and the ways to change school practitioners' negative perceptions of educational research. Refinements to the questionnaire and its cross-disciplinary comparison to other professions are also open for future inquiry...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the general conception {{and the results}} of a methodological research performed among workers in a factory in a small town, capital of a district. It is a study of adequacy of questionnaire procedures with relation to a certain occupational and social environment. The term adequacy has a double meaning here psychological, as the problem under consideration is whether the applied procedure is fitting for the given group because of emotional and intellectual characteristics of its members; and sociological, related with the research situation considered as close or remote to social situations ever experienced by subjects of the study. The survey was designed to cover 83 men, working on one shift in one department of a textile factory. They had at least 5 years of standing at work and finished at least 5 classes of an elementary school. However, only 59 persons appeared on the assigned day. The respondents were asked to fill in a questionnaire immediately after their working hours, in three groups of 20 to 30 men, each one under supervision of two-men research teams. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions concerning mainly the respondents’ <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> the management’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> workers, their appreciation of the working discipline there in force, and their feelings about forms of address and phrases used by foremen in their direct contacts with workers and by workers when addressing their foremen. During the whole time of the research situation respondents were carefully observed. It allowed to divide the sample into 3 categories of <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the research situation. Thus 7 persons manifested obvious reluctance to participate. However, none of them {{went so far as to}} refuse to collaborate. The most numerous category consisted of persons who manifested neither interest nor obvious reluctance to the questionnaire situation. There were also 6 persons who were positively interested in the study and in its scientific or practical meaning. In the analysis of data particular attention was paid to the problem of adequacy of answers and of lack of answers. Only 40 questionnaires (68 %) were filled in completely, while only 47 (80 %) were filled without faults. 35 forms (59 %) were filled in both completely and without faults. In that number only 6 were filled by respondents who had not had full elementary education, while there were 18 such persons in the whole sample. These data constitute empirical evidence that elementary education is the threshold of performing even simple questionnaire research programs. Lacks of answers and faults in answering, hardly ever analysed in questionnaire surveys, may serve as indications of adequacy of employed procedures and may thus help to interpret, the collected data. After some time since the questionnaire situation control open interviews were made with 28 members of the most numerous group of questionnaire respondents in order to secure repeated answers to two specially chosen questions of the questionnaire. What mattered was the degree of consistency of declarations uttered on the same topic in different situations. It was fond that at least 9 persons changed their minds about one, and at least 5 persons about two questions. As there were 28 respondents in general, this seems to be an evidence of a low degree of consistency of opinions expressed in the two situations. Besides, the data seem to indicate that the filling, of a questionnaire in the work environment did not, against the researchers’ expectations, make the expressed opinions more „official“ or „formal“. To the contrary, responses were more “official“ during the interview, in spite of using the whole range of means of the “art of interviewing“ in order to create an atmosphere of a sincere and intimate conversation. Parallely, another series of interviews was made with members of the two smaller groups of questionnaire respondents. This series was methodological in character, designed to secure information <b>about</b> the general <b>attitude</b> of workers toward the research situation. 20 respondents were thus interviewed, somewhat younger and better educated in average than the others. Perhaps that was why 17 of them said the questionnaire had been easy for them, while the three who admitted some difficulties suffered only 5 years of schooling. The majority of respondents (14 as against 6) felt anonymous enough, and this seems to account in a certain degree for the fact that the questionnaire situation had not made, their opinions „official“. Respondents were rather unlikely to expect (13 as against 7) that the results of the questionnaire could ever be used, for practical purposes; it might increase the tendency to neglect the research situation. Remarks about sincerity of responses (10 to 10) and about eagerness to participate (9 as against 11) also indicate that workers had hardly been convinced that the questionnaire was a suitable tool to grasp their real <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> how matters stood in the factory. The whole material seems to prove that of the two employed research procedures the technique of individual interviewing was both psychologically and sociologically more, adequate, for the studied community...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to assess knowledge <b>about,</b> and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards,</b> fertility preservation in young female cancer patients. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted including 155 former female cancer patients from English and German speaking countries. The survey consists of questions <b>about</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>towards,</b> and knowledge <b>about,</b> fertility preservation. Results show that knowledge about fertility preservation was limited among participants. Positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> fertility preservation significantly outweighed negative attitudes. Knowledge and attitude did not differ according to language or different healthcare systems. Confidence of knowledge was significantly higher in women who underwent any FP procedure compared to those who did not. Greater emphasis should be placed on counselling opportunities, the provision of adequate information and supporting material. A better understanding of these issues will hopefully enhance patients’ decision-making about FP options and assist the development of strategies to improve quality of care...|$|R
