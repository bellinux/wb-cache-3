25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> many.|$|E
500|$|Borders {{are another}} theme in Chatwin's work. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he [...] "was {{interested}} in borders, where things were always changing, not <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> another." [...] Patagonia, {{the subject of}} his first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile. The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey. On the Black Hills takes place on the borders of Wales and England. In The Songlines the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds. The main character in Utz travels {{back and forth across the}} Iron Curtain.|$|E
500|$|Horses in the Middle Ages {{were rarely}} {{differentiated}} by breed, {{but rather by}} use. [...] This led them to be described, for example, as [...] "chargers" [...] (war horses), [...] "palfreys" [...] (riding horses), cart horses or packhorses. [...] Reference is also given to their place of origin, such as [...] "Spanish horses," [...] but whether this referred to one breed or several is unknown. Another difficulty arising during any study of medieval documents or literature is {{the flexibility of the}} medieval languages, where several words can be used for <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> (<b>or,</b> conversely, several objects are referred to by one word). [...] Words such as 'courser' and 'charger' are used interchangeably (even within one document), and where one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey, another praises its skill and swiftness.|$|E

500|$|Accepting the nomination, Lincoln {{delivered}} his House Divided Speech, drawing on , [...] "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I {{do not expect}} the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>or</b> all the other." [...] The speech created an evocative image {{of the danger of}} disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated [...] " [...] is the strong man of the party...and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugo Lindgren of The New York Times {{stated that}} the [...] "record sounds {{as if it were}} made to slip quietly into the marketplace, connect with the {{faithful}} and leave everyone else alone", and that [...] "there's no catchy single, and not even the slightest echo of anything else happening in pop music now." [...] He added that the [...] "band's grooves still sound taut, emotive and world-class." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Guardian gave the album two out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "Riot Act isn't <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> the other: tracks such as [...] "Ghost" [...] or [...] "Get Right" [...] gesture towards hard rock without really putting the hammer down, while a more reflective piece like [...] "All or None" [...] doesn't exploit its own possibilities." [...] Sweeting observed, [...] "On full, Pearl Jam sound like Stillwater, Cameron Crowe's fictional 1970s second-raters from his film Almost Famous." [...] Kyle Reiter of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness", and stated that it [...] " [...] them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory." ...|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the course}} of {{communicating}} with the Scotsmen in Spain and France, Keith {{realized that there was}} a considerable division of factions among James' supporters. The sides all wanted Keith to communicate <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>or</b> another, often contradictory, to the king, all of which Keith considered favored their private ends, not the needs of the king or the goals of the campaign. [...] Eventually, the Scots embarked for the Isle of Lewis on 19 March in a small ship, {{from the mouth of the}} Seine, and set course to round the Orkney Islands [...] The wind forced them off course until, after 24 March, they had altered course and managed to blow by a squadron of English men-of-war which were transporting troops from Ireland to England: news of a conspiracy had reached London by then, and the British had prepared.|$|E

For comedies, the approach of pairing mismatched couples is also often applied, and for dramas, there {{tends to be a}} [...] "will-they-won't-they" [...] setup. Website Cinemablend states that there are two general formulas for a [...] "will-they-wont-they" [...] setup. [...] "The first one is when one person pursues the other, then finally gives up and dates someone else," [...] the site stated, [...] "and the other scenario is when the two characters are so different and often do not get along with one another, they fight and argue constantly, but then <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> a series of 'things' happen and they are forced to put up with each other." [...] Examples of popular couples cited for having displayed this formula are Buffy and Spike (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Ross and Rachel (of the show Friends), Logan and Veronica (of the show Veronica Mars), among others.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} negative reviews upon release. The film's makeup {{special effects}} were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. Film critic Roger Ebert called the film [...] "disappointing", though {{said he found}} it scary {{and that it was}} [...] "a great barf-bag movie." [...] However, he criticized what he felt were poor characterizations and illogical plot elements, ultimately giving the film 2½ stars out of 4. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> the other. Sometimes it looks as if it aspired to be the quintessential moron movie of the 80s." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Designer Rob Bottin's work is novel and unforgettable, but since it exists in a near vacuum emotionally, it becomes too domineering dramatically and something of an exercise in abstract art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in my nature. I have no ulterior motives. If I can do a man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone.

2500|$|Some works (e.g. by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim) {{have been}} made into both [...] "musical theatre" [...] and [...] "operatic" [...] productions. Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan) have been {{produced}} in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost {{as important as the}} work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls. Sondheim said, [...] "I really think that when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> another." [...] Although this article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are [...] "non-operatic", there remains an overlap in form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex or ambitious musicals. In practice, {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including [...] "musical play", [...] "musical comedy", [...] "operetta" [...] and [...] "light opera".|$|E

2500|$|Turning {{finally to}} Bilski's method, {{the court held}} it patent-ineligible. First, the court said, Bilski did not argue that the {{rejected}} claims recited any specific or [...] "particular" [...] machine, so that the court found it unnecessary to decide any issues relating to the machine-implementation branch of the test. [...] "We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, {{as well as the}} answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine." [...] Second, the court turned to transformation of articles from <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> state to another. What is an [...] "article"? Benson had made it clear that tanning hides, smelting ores, and vulcanizing rubber were all instances of transforming articles. This corresponded to the transformation test as the PTO and some amici curiae articulated it: one physical substance is transformed into a second physical substance. But what of electronic signals and electronically manipulated data? Or even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, which the Bilski case involved? No Supreme Court precedents addressed such entities.|$|E
