The unknowns in this synthesis problem are the coordinates g=(gx, gy) of the coupler attachment to the input crank and the coordinates w=(wx, wy) of the attachment to the <b>output</b> <b>crank,</b> measured in their respective reference frames.|$|E
50|$|This {{formulation}} of the input-output synthesis of a four-bar linkage is an inversion of finite-position synthesis, where {{the movement of the}} <b>output</b> <b>crank</b> relative to the input crank is specified by the designer. From this viewpoint the ground link OC is a crank that satisfies the specified finite positions of the movement of the <b>output</b> <b>crank</b> relative to the input crank, and Burmester's results show that its existence guarantees the presence of at least one coupler link. Furthermore, Burmester's results show that there may be as many as three of these coupler links that provide the desired input-output relationship.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanism}} {{in which a}} body moves through a general spatial movement is called a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which {{can be viewed as}} a four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by rod ends, also called spherical joints or ball joints. The rod ends allow the input and <b>output</b> <b>cranks</b> of the RSSR linkage to be misaligned to the point that they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a general spatial movement. Robot arms, Stewart platforms, and humanoid robotic systems are also examples of spatial mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Two levers, or cranks, are {{combined}} into a planar four-bar linkage by attaching a link that connects the <b>output</b> of one <b>crank</b> to the input of another. Additional links can be attached to form a six-bar linkage or in series to form a robot.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the more}} common {{applications}} of a four-bar linkage appears as a rod that connects two levers, so that rotation of the first lever drives {{the rotation of the}} second lever. The levers are hinged to a ground frame and are called the input and output cranks, and the connecting rod is the called the coupler link. Burmester's approach to the design of a four-bar linkage can be used to locate the coupler so that five specified angles of the input crank result in five specified angles of the <b>output</b> <b>crank.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: It was {{recently}} demonstrated that musculoarticular (MA) stiffness {{is related to}} sprint cycling performance in nonfatigued conditions. This study examined whether relatively stiffer cyclists were more effective at sprinting under fatigued conditions, as occurs during endurance cycling competitions. METHODS: MA stiffness of the quadriceps was assessed in 21 trained male cyclists (28. 7 ± 9. 5 yr, 1. 74 ± 0. 08 m, 67. 5 ± 7. 2 kg). Participants also performed a maximal 6 -s sprint on a cycle ergometer to assess peak power <b>output</b> (POpeak), peak <b>crank</b> torque (CTpeak), and peak rate of crank torque development (RCTDpeak). A cycling fatigue protocol then required cyclists to pedal at 30...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue {{to rising}} public focus scientiﬁc {{analysis}} of performance parameters {{is getting more}} and more important in paralympic sports. Several studies have been performed to investigate different design parameters of handcycles (e. g. crank length) already; however, most of those were done with able-bodied subjects, widely unfamiliar to handcycling. In this study bilateral surface electromyography (sEMG) of several muscles of the upper body and arms of an elite handcyclist (multiple medal-winner in Paralympic Games and World Championships) is performed with different crank lengths, crank positions and backrest positions at power levels of 130, 160 and 190 W resulting in a total of 22 measurements. sEMG data were recorded bilaterally at a recording frequency of 1000 Hz using Ag/AgCl electrodes. Concurrently the crank position was acquired with ten Vicon Bonita infrared cameras recording at 100 Hz. EMG data were rectiﬁed, smoothed and normalized to crank-cycle duration (0 - 360 deg) for each single crank-cycle. Phases of activity for each muscle (i. e. EMG amplitude exceeds 30 % of maximum amplitude) and integrated EMG (iEMG) as an indicator for net muscular e ort were calculated. Results showed that amplitude and iEMG were higher for higher power <b>output</b> and shorter <b>cranks,</b> crank and backrest position inﬂuenced several muscles but results were always similar for similar shoulder-crank-distances. It could be shown, that muscular effort is clearly inﬂuenced by the handcycle parameters investigated and that these measurements can be used to individually optimize the position in a handcycle with regard to muscular effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{cold start}} {{performance}} of automotive diesel engines is currently poor {{when compared to}} similar gasoline units. This thesis describes an experimental and theoretical investigation into the factors limiting diesel cold start behaviour. Studies {{have been carried out}} on IDI and DI designs of engine. Start behaviour has been characterised in terms of times taken to complete various stages of startup, engine speed variations and processes which affect these. Combustion and friction behaviour have been investigated in detail. Engine friction losses are dependent on temperature. During start-up these losses are relatively high compared to those when the engine is fully-warm. The work output from combustion is low at low speeds, and prone to a further deterioration at lower temperatures. Consequently, combustion <b>output</b> during cold <b>cranking</b> is initially insufficient to overcome frictional losses. The start times are extended by the need to keep the starter motor engaged until heat generated in the engine causes frictional losses to fall. Eventually, when combustion output is able to overcome friction without the aid of starter motor work, idle speed is reached. Changes to fuel injection and glowplug parameters have been used to achieve a limited improvement in low-temperature starting. Measurements of engine friction have been carried out to determine the influence of temperature and speed, and the relative contributions from each of the main component assemblies. At low temperatures, much of the friction originates in hydrodynamically lubricated components such as journal bearings, due to high oil viscosity at low temperature. Additionally, engine friction as rotation begins {{has been shown to be}} far higher than measured by conventional "steady-state" motoring tests (over twice the quasi-steady state friction at - 200 e). This initially high friction transient decays towards the quasi-steady values throughout the start. For crankshaft bearings, a friction model has been developed for cold start-up through to fully warm engine conditions. The friction behaviour in the bearings is dependent on thermal conditions around the friction surfaces. Models for the starter system and blowby processes are also presented as part of a broader theoretical investigation to assess the impact of design changes on start quality...|$|R
40|$|Handrim {{wheelchair}} propulsion is a straining form of ambulation. In contrast, arm crank {{exercise in}} laboratory settings {{has shown a}} higher degree of gross mechanical efficiency and increased levels of peak power <b>output.</b> Moreover, arm <b>crank</b> exercise can be conducted at different gear ratios and in asynchronic or synchronic mode. Although tricycle crank exercise or handcycling has become increasingly popular for recreational use, sports and outdoor wheeling over the last decade, today {{little is known about the}} cardiopulmonary strain in handcycling. The physiological and subjective responses during handcycling were evaluated in a group of 12 male non-wheelchair users (age 24. 6 +/- 2. 7 yr; body weight 73. 7 +/- 9. 7 kg). During an incremental submaximal exercise test on a motor driven treadmill (velocity: 1. 8 ms- 1; an incremental slope of 1 % per 3 min; 0 - 3 %; mean power output of the subject group varied between 7. 6 +/- 1. 6 W and 47. 5 +/- 6. 2 W), effects of asynchronic and synchronic crank settings and three different gear ratios (1 : 0. 42, 1 : 0. 59, 1 : 0. 74 (or 24, 36 and 44 rpm)) were evaluated in a random testing sequence. Significantly lower levels of mean oxygen uptake, ventilation, relative heart rate and oxygen uptake were seen during synchronic arm use and for the lighter gear ratios (i. e. higher movement frequency; 44 rpm). Subjective local perceived discomfort showed similar trends. Conversely, gross mechanical efficiency appeared higher for these conditions. The need for strong medio-lateral stabilizing muscle effort during asynchronic arm use (to ensure a proper wheeling direction as well as simultaneous power transfer to the cranks) and the effective use of the trunk in this subject group may explain the advantage of synchronic arm use. Whether this advantage is consolidated among wheelchair confined individuals needs further study. Apart from the important effects of a shift in force [...] velocity characteristics of the contracting muscles with varying gear ratios, increased static finger flexor and arm muscle activity may explain the increased strain in the somewhat unnatural heavy gear condition (24 rpm) at the studied velocity. Results need to be re-evaluated for wheelchair user populations and different higher velocities and power conditions. Moreover, other aspects of the wheelchair [...] user interface must be studied in order to generate optimum fitting and design guidelines for different user groups and conditions of use...|$|R
