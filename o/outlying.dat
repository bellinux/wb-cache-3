5|$|In 1997, seating of the Legislative Council (also public {{services}} and election franchises) of Hong Kong modelled on the British system: Urban Council (Hong Kong and Kowloon) and District Council (New Territories and <b>Outlying</b> Islands). In 1999, this {{system has been}} reformed into 18 directly elected District Offices across 5 Legislative Council constituencies: Hong Kong Island (East/West), Kowloon and New Territories (East/West); the remaining <b>outlying</b> islands are divided across the aforementioned regions.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>outlying</b> {{areas around}} the bay remain semi-rural. Cattle {{ranching}} and agriculture remain staples of some local economies as well as shrimp fishing and oyster farming.|$|E
5|$|Albury offers similar {{facilities}} to Wagga Wagga {{to the far}} south of New South Wales and northern Victoria. The three largest centres in population in the region after Wagga Wagga and Albury are Griffith, Leeton and Deniliquin and they provide advanced services to the <b>outlying</b> farming regions.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the {{syndrome}} itself, {{it is hard}} to determine whether certain additional diseases are actually part of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two <b>outlying</b> cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Britain {{obtained}} a 99-year lease from Qing under the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, in which Hong Kong {{obtained a}} 99-year lease of Lantau Island, the area north of Boundary Street in Kowloon up to Shenzhen River and over 200 other <b>outlying</b> islands.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>outlying</b> north Bay Area, Interstate 10 links Anahuac {{and other}} {{communities}} nearby connecting them to Houston {{and the rest}} of the Bay Area. Highway 124 provides access to the Bolivar Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an <b>outlying</b> {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and {{is thought to be}} over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an <b>outlying</b> component on {{the eastern edge of the}} Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.|$|E
5|$|Regular ferry {{services}} operate {{between the}} Scottish mainland and <b>outlying</b> islands. Ferries serving both {{the inner and}} outer Hebrides are principally operated by the State-owned enterprise Caledonian MacBrayne.|$|E
5|$|Sewage {{service in}} Erie is {{provided}} by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many <b>outlying</b> townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The Authority cleans about 30− of wastewater every day.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston's campus {{framework}} {{has identified}} {{the following five}} core areas and districts: inner campus, the ArtsDistrict, the ProfessionalDistrict, the WheelerDistrict, and the StadiumDistrict. In addition, the campus contains several <b>outlying</b> areas not identified among the four districts.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{included}} in the monument {{are all part of}} the State of Hawaii, except Midway Atoll, which is part of The United States Minor <b>Outlying</b> Islands insular area. Henderson Field, on Midway Atoll, provides aerial access to the monument.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa {{occurs on}} coastal dunes and sandplains in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia, from East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the {{vicinity}} of Hopetoun eastwards to Israelite Bay, generally within 50km (31mi) of the coast. The range extends inland to Mount Ragged and 25km (16mi) southwest of Grass Patch. There is an <b>outlying</b> population to the east at Point Culver on the Great Australian Bight.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha {{is served}} by a health centre, Centro de Saúde Caldas da Rainha, which offers primary and non-urgent care. In {{addition}} to several units co-located with the main health centre, there are extensions located in the <b>outlying</b> civil parishes of A dos Francos, Alvorninha, Foz do Arelho, Landal, Santa Catarina, Tornada, and Vidais.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gene caused {{widespread}} {{damage to}} several of Fiji's main islands, including Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Yasawa, Mamanuca, and other <b>outlying</b> island groups, while killing a total of 8 people. The cyclone also caused severe damage to Vanautu's Futuna island after its outerbands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been cut}} with {{irrigation}} channels, and been {{the site of}} burning and peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. The Moss today is common ground, but a track runs through it to provide access for local farmers to <b>outlying</b> fields, which surround it. An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{comprises}} three geographical regions, which {{coincided with}} its historical expansion by the British colonial government: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (1860) and the New Territories and <b>Outlying</b> Islands (1898). The first established settlement was City of Victoria on Hong Kong Island. Its area coincided with modern-day Central and Western District (#15 in map).|$|E
5|$|In {{general the}} species is in decline, more quickly on the {{mainland}} than on the <b>outlying</b> islets. The Cuban mainland populations have been declining {{at a rate of}} over 1% per year for the last 10years. The Cuban iguana is no longer found on the northeastern coast of Havana, the Hicacos Peninsula, or Cayo Largo, areas where it was found in great numbers some 30 to 40years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} option, the North Vietnamese had to destroy all the <b>outlying</b> South Vietnamese defences {{and then move}} on to Ban Me Thuot. The Central Highlands Front, under General Hoang Minh Thao's command, ordered all combat units to follow the second option and destroy the defences around Ban Me Thuot, but to be ready to switch to the first option when the {{opportunity}} presented itself.|$|E
5|$|Ja'far {{began his}} {{campaign}} in 877 by raiding the Byzantine territories {{in the east}} of the island and occupying some <b>outlying</b> forts around Syracuse. The siege of the city began in August, with the Arabs blockading it by sea and land. The events of the siege are described in some detail by the eyewitness Theodosios the Monk, who included an account of it in a letter written during his subsequent captivity.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses {{operates}} {{the majority of}} bus services in Edinburgh, extending to <b>outlying</b> suburbs, towns and villages within Edinburgh, East Lothian and Midlothian.

5|$|Maya {{cities were}} not {{formally}} planned, and {{were subject to}} irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to <b>outlying</b> areas of the city. Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the <b>outlying</b> areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship {{equal to that of}} royal art.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April, the Rangers, {{tanks and}} {{engineers}} conducted another probe of the Chinese positions, {{to ensure they}} could not launch a surprise attack on nearby Republic of Korea Army formations. Encountering two Chinese companies dug in at a hill with one route of attack, Tidwell ordered a surprise attack on the hill, which was successful in pushing Chinese forces off the <b>outlying</b> fortifications.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and <b>outlying</b> region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a {{decision}} on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Zurich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.|$|E
5|$|<b>Outlying</b> villages include East Coker, West Coker, Hardington, Evershot, Halstock, Stoford, Barwick, Sutton Bingham, Mudford and Yetminster. Other nearby villages include Bradford Abbas, Thornford Corscombe, Montacute (where {{one will}} find Montacute House), and Pendomer. The village of Brympton, now almost {{a suburb of}} Yeovil, {{contains}} the medieval manor of Brympton d'Evercy. Tintinhull is also a village close to Yeovil featuring the National Trust owned Tintinhull House and Gardens.|$|E
5|$|Shaw and Crompton has {{communal}} {{areas and}} public facilities, including public parks, sporting establishments, and playing fields. Public {{houses in the}} centre of the town include The Shay Wake (a mill town-themed J D Wetherspoon pub, named after the Shaw Wakes week), The Blue Bell, Duke of York, Coach and Horses, and The Pineapple. <b>Outlying</b> public houses include the Royal Oak at Cowlishaw, and the Park Inn at Buckstones Road.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from <b>outlying</b> districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force.|$|E
5|$|The Lethbridge School District No. 51 and the {{separate}} Holy Spirit Roman Catholic School Division administer grades kindergarten through 12 locally. The Palliser School Division, {{which is based}} in Lethbridge, administers public primary and secondary education in the <b>outlying</b> areas. Lethbridge School District No. 51 administers four high schools (Chinook High School, Lethbridge Collegiate Institute, Winston Churchill High School and Immanuel Christian High School), four middle schools, and 12 elementary schools in Lethbridge.|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are <b>outlying</b> hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
5|$|The archipelago's remote {{location}} and oceanic climate are matched in the UK {{only by a}} few smaller <b>outlying</b> islands such as the Flannan Isles, North Rona, Sula Sgeir, and the Bishop's Isles at {{the southern edge of}} the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire. Today it is incorporated in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles) unitary authority.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is endemic to the {{south-eastern}} forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with <b>outlying</b> colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide in the south. In the southern parts of its range it occupies more extreme latitudes than any other Pteropus species.|$|E
5|$|Waldron Field, an <b>outlying</b> {{training}} {{landing strip}} at Corpus Christi NAS, {{as well as}} Waldron Road leading to the strip, was {{named in honor of}} John C. Waldron, the commander of USS Hornets Torpedo Squadron 8. Yorktown Boulevard leading away from the strip was named for the U.S. carrier sunk in the battle.|$|E
5|$|While {{iron and}} steel have long been the main {{industries}} of Sheffield, coal mining {{has also been a}} major industry, particularly in the <b>outlying</b> areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone from quarries in the nearby village of Anston. Other areas of employment include call centres, the City Council, universities and hospitals.|$|E
5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and <b>outlying</b> areas around Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Sicumba, Alvarado led {{his army}} to the Indian village of Choloma, {{in the general}} region of Puerto de Caballos. On 27 June 1536, Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement, {{with the name of}} Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into <b>outlying</b> regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.|$|E
5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the {{security}} of the cathedral and its <b>outlying</b> buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its <b>outlying</b> regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
