5|$|Fancy rats {{have their}} origins as the targets for blood sport in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Specially bred as pets since then, fancy rats now {{come in a}} wide variety <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> coat types and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups around the world. Fancy rats are {{commonly}} sold as pets in stores and by breeders.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Louis Prang {{was born}} 12 March 1824 in Breslau. At {{the age of}} 13 he began apprenticing for his father and learned to dye and print calico, as well as wood and metal engraving. Prang emigrated to Boston in 1850 and became an {{illustrator}} {{for a number of}} local publications. Starting a business partnership in 1856 to manufacture copper and lithographic plates, Prang became sole proprietor in 1860 and named the company L. Prang & Co. He specialized in color printing, more specifically “chromolithography” Prang spent over four decades studying and creating a standard <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> engraved and printed maps, prints of contemporary celebrities, and color reproductions of famous works of art.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an analysis <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared stereo approaches to pedestrian detection. We design a four camera experimental testbed consisting <b>of</b> two <b>color</b> <b>and</b> two infrared cameras {{that allows for}} synchronous capture and direct frame-by-frame comparison of pedestrian detection approaches. We incorporate this four camera system in a test vehicle and conduct comparative experiments of stereo-based approaches to obstacle detection using <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared imagery. A detailed analysis of these experiments shows the robustness <b>of</b> both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared stereo imagery to generate the dense stereo maps necessary for robust object detection <b>and</b> motivates investigation <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared features {{that can be used}} to further classify detected obstacles into pedestrian regions. The complementary nature <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared features gives rise to a discussion of a feature fusion techniques, including a cross-spectral stereo solution to pedestrian detection.

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Koichi Sugiyama, who {{made use of}} East Asian elements compared to his more European-styled Dragon Quest compositions, using instruments such as a shakuhachi flute. The scenario was written by Shin-ichiro Tomie and edited by Emiko Tanaka. In addition to the main story, Tomie wrote another scenario for the game, which the developers were unable to implement in the Super Famicom version. When creating the graphics, the development team faced challenges with the technical restrictions of the Super Famicom console: they were only able to use a limited amount <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> <b>and</b> were restricted to a 32×32 resolution for all graphics and actions. While later games in the series feature two programs – one for the story and one for dungeons – the first Shiren the Wanderer only uses a dungeon program, which lead to difficulties in portraying certain scenes, such as one where several townspeople are meant to appear, but {{the limitations of the}} dungeon program meant that only two non-player characters could be generated.|$|E
