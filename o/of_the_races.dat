5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races.</b> They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Races</b> when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E
5|$|Two {{and a half}} centuries {{after the}} First War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Races,</b> Brona returns as the Warlock Lord, now with Skull Bearers as his servants. Chronicled in the prequel novel First King of Shannara, the Second War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Races</b> begins with the {{destruction}} of the Druid Order. A lone Druid, Bremen, forges a magical talisman to destroy the Warlock Lord; it is given to the Elven King, Jerle Shannara. As it {{takes the form of a}} blade, the talisman is named the Sword of Shannara. It succeeds in banishing the Warlock Lord. He is not killed, but his army is defeated by the combined armies of the Elves and Dwarves. Peace comes at a high price, interracial tension is renewed and the Druids have vanished.|$|E
5|$|Between his 1969 {{victory in}} the race and 1981, Andretti dropped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> due to part {{failures}} or crashes. His luck seemed to turn around in 1981. Andretti {{finished second in the}} 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> {{has been}} changed several times. The most recent change was in 1998 when <b>the</b> {{direction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was changed. <b>The</b> reason was <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new grandstand. <b>The</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racecourse is mainly grass, but one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> is run through ploughed fields, which used to take almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> in <b>the</b> past. Some obstacles have also been changed, mostly to improve safety, although <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> {{is said to have}} suffered as a result.|$|R
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Races,</b> to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Elves are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> that inhabit {{a fictional}} Earth, often called Middle-earth, {{and set in}} the remote past. They appear in The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings, but their complex history is {{described}} more fully in The Silmarillion. Tolkien had been writing about Elves long before he published The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1944, under {{conditions}} of severe racism, a race riot broke out in Guam at a naval base. In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base, Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for total integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> within the Navy. The Port Chicago disaster had helped catalyze the drive to implement new standards.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1990, Rosecroft Raceway {{hosted the}} Messenger Stakes, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> for the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Rosecroft {{attracted}} the Potomac Stakes, Maryland's most successful race, starting in that year. The Potomac Stakes was previously held at Freestate Raceway and generated one-million-dollar-plus handles on several occasions. On a September 1990 night, $1,195,681 was wagered by bettors, becoming the then-largest handle in Rosecroft's history. This record was broken on May 3, 2003 when $1,564,150 was wagered. Vogel {{was arrested in}} September 1990 for possession of cocaine, and his company filed for bankruptcy protection.|$|E
5|$|Haryanto's {{victory in}} the second race was his first {{victory in the}} GP2 Series after 70 races. The results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> meant Vandoorne assumed {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship with 43 points, ten in front of Haryanto. Rossi assumed third position, while Berthon's third-place finish in the second event allowed put him in fourth. Jordan King rounded out the top five. ART Grand Prix became the leaders of the Teams' Championship with a 15-point {{advantage}} over Racing Engineering. Campos Racing were two points behind in third position, while Lazarus and Rapax rounded out the top five, with ten rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E

5|$|Okilani Tinilau was {{the only}} male athlete from Tuvalu who competed in a track and field event, {{representing}} {{the country in the}} men's 100metres races at the Beijing Olympics. He was born in January 1989, and was 19 {{years old at the time}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Tinilau had not previously competed at any Olympic Games. During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races,</b> which took place during August 14, Tinilau competed in the tenth heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.48seconds, placing last in the event. he was directly behind Chad's Moumi Sébergué (11.14seconds), who placed seventh; and Gabon's Wilfried Bingangoye (10.87seconds), who placed sixth. The heat itself was led by Dutch Antilean athlete Churandy Martina (10.35seconds) and Japanese runner Naoki Tsukahara (10.39seconds). Of the 80 competitors in the event, Tinilau ranked 77th and did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{have stated that}} non-human characters and races feature {{a prominent role in}} the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers. Comparing the non-human races in Final Fantasy IX with those of XII, the developers have stated that the former were modeled after humans, while the latter were fundamentally different in terms of biological characteristics. These non-human races include Bangaa, Viera, Seeq, and Moogles. In the game humans are referred to as Humes. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> in the game that first appeared in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, such as Bangaa, were originally designed for Final Fantasy XII.|$|E
5|$|The result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> meant Markelov {{moved into}} {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship with 54 points, ahead of Nato who dropped to second. Giovinazzi's two {{victories}} meant he moved into third place. Gasly remained in fourth place on 45 points, but was now two points ahead of nearest rival Marciello in fifth. Russian Time remained in the lead of the Teams' Championship with 97 points, and were eight points in front of Prema Racing in second place. Racing Engineering dropped to third position on 73 position, while DAMS moved down one place to fourth. ART Grand Prix rounded out the top five on 60 points, with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} in Prince Rainier III of Monaco's Royal box to collect their trophies {{and in the}} subsequent press conference. Coulthard was delighted as securing victory at the Grand Prix which he considered as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> he wanted to win during his career because of the challenges the drivers take on the circuit. He also commented {{that he wanted to}} wait until the pit stop stages to get ahead of Michael Schumacher and Trulli to prevent unnecessary repairs to his car. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving his tyres and fuel, as well as being informed by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn to reduce his pace towards the race's latter stages. Fisichella said that he was pleased at taking third place. He also revealed that he wanted to remain at Benetton for the 2001 season after his strong result.|$|E
5|$|Veranda's Willems-Accent {{took only}} five {{victories}} during the 2011 season, of which three came in summer stage races. Steven Caethoven took {{the final stage}} victory at the Delta Tour Zeeland in the Netherlands, while Stefan van Dijk and Jurgen Van Goolen won stages at the Route du Sud race, held {{in the south of}} France. The team also recorded no fewer than 28 top-ten placings in single-day races, including two victories for Evert Verbist at the Beverbeek Classic in February and Gregory Habeaux at Dwars door het Hageland in July. Although not winning any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races,</b> van Dijk was the team's most consistent performer, and ended the season in sixth place in the UCI Europe Tour points standings, while Staf Scheirlinckx took an eighth place finish at World Tour level, in the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Villeneuve started {{competitive}} {{driving in}} local drag-racing events, entering his road car, a modified 1967 Ford Mustang. He was soon bored by this {{and entered the}} Jim Russell Racing School at Le Circuit Mont Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, running his own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, competing there for four years, running his own car again {{for one of those}} seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motosport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison's Ecurie Canada and factory March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning all but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.|$|E

5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races.</b> This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
5|$|Two 90-minute {{practice}} sessions were held on February 22. Matt Kenseth was quickest {{in the first}} practice session, {{with a time of}} 44.809 seconds. Trevor Bayne was second-quickest with a lap-time 0.009 seconds slower. Ricky Stenhouse Jr, with a time of 44.849 seconds, was third-fastest, ahead of Marcos Ambrose and Mark Martin. Clint Bowyer, Michael McDowell and Kevin Harvick. Paul Menard and Kasey Kahne completed the top ten. During the session, Brad Keselowski slowed to avoid Ryan Newman, causing Clint Bowyer to turn into Keselowski, whose car went spinning into the grass on the backstretch. Keselowski's car sustained minor damage; his team could repair it, meaning he was not required to use a backup car. Aric Almirola led the second practice, in which 25 drivers competed, with a lap of 45.065 seconds—nearly one-tenth of a second faster than David Stremme. David Ragan was third, ahead of Robert Richardson, Jr. and Greg Biffle. Bobby Labonte, Joe Nemechek, Bill Elliott, Michael Waltrip and Kahne completed the top ten ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>races.</b>|$|E
