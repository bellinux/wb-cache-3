5|$|Upon release, Return <b>of</b> <b>Saturn</b> {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, although {{several of them}} were divided over its different sound to its predecessor. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 {{but was unable to}} measure up to the sales of Tragic Kingdom. The album spawned four singles, only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 43rd Grammy Awards, Return <b>of</b> <b>Saturn</b> was nominated for Best Rock Album.|$|E

5|$|Neptune has a {{planetary}} ring system, though one much less substantial than that <b>of</b> <b>Saturn.</b> The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely {{gives them a}} reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the planet}} was {{detected}} indirectly through observations of its star, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. With a mass similar to that <b>of</b> <b>Saturn,</b> 55 Cancri c {{is likely to be}} a gas giant without a solid surface.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the moons}} <b>of</b> <b>Saturn,</b> {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.|$|E

Everything in Time is an album of B-sides, rare songs and remixes, taken mainly from the recording sessions of Return <b>of</b> <b>Saturn.</b> Live in the Tragic Kingdom is a recording of a concert filmed during the band's tour for Tragic Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A precise {{value for}} the {{rotation}} period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that the radio rotation period <b>of</b> <b>Saturn</b> had increased appreciably, to approximately 10hr 45min 45sec (±36sec). The latest estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10hr 32min 35sec.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings <b>of</b> <b>Saturn,</b> {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings <b>of</b> <b>Saturn.</b> Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} <b>of</b> <b>Saturn</b> to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E

50|$|Of course, the S-IVB {{would also}} be used as the third stage <b>of</b> the <b>Saturn</b> V. Its first stage was the S-IC. Since no stage {{initially}} designed to be a second stage had ever been manufactured (remember, the second stage <b>of</b> the <b>Saturn</b> IB was still an evolved version of the initially-envisioned fourth stage), it received the S-II designation.|$|R

5|$|Kepler-5b is a Hot Jupiter with a {{mass that}} is 2.114 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.431 times Jupiter's radius. This also means that Kepler-5b is not very dense. The planet's {{measured}} density is 0.894grams/cm3, {{less than that of}} pure water and comparable only to the density <b>of</b> <b>Saturn,</b> which is approximately 0.69grams/cm3. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 1868 K, making it fifteen times hotter than Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, {{have been shown to}} be the source of the material in Saturn's E ring. The E ring is the widest and outermost ring <b>of</b> <b>Saturn</b> (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E
5|$|The Gallic {{group are}} four {{prograde}} outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distance from the planet (207–302 radii <b>of</b> <b>Saturn),</b> their orbital inclination (35–40°) and their color {{that they can be}} considered a group. They are Albiorix, Bebhionn, Erriapus, and Tarvos. Tarvos, as of 2009, is the most distant of Saturn's moons with a prograde orbit. The largest among these moons is Albiorix with an estimated size of about 32km.|$|E
