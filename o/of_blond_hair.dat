5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. Investigators found {{a piece of}} duct tape with strands <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> attached to it; the samples were tested at a Dutch lab.

The hair samples were then tested a second time. The FBI {{announced that}} the hair samples {{did not belong to}} Holloway.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and blue eyes.|$|E

25|$|Loop My Loop is a {{back-lit}} cibachrome photograph <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> {{intertwined with}} a pig's intestines. The golden locks signify purity and love knotted with the intestines, which signifies the raw animalistic side to human nature. This work has {{links with the}} ideas of Georges Bataille, a French intellectual and literary figure who worked in fields such as anthropology, sociology, and history of art. Chadwick's Loop My Loop is similar to her work from 1990, titled Nostalgie de la Boue. In this work, two rounded cibachrome transparencies were hung one above the other. The top one contained a ring of earthworms, while the bottom pictured someone's scalp with the center imploding. Both images appear similar, but by placing the worms above the human scalp the distinction upholding the human above the animal is no longer held.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{made by the}} University College London which {{included}}, {{which included}} the countries of Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Brazil, and was made with collaboration of each countries' antrophology and genetics institutes reported the genetic ancestry of Mexican Mestizos was 56% Native American, 37% European and 5% African making Mexico, after Peru, {{the country with the}} highest Amerindian ancestry out of the five sample populations. Additionally, different phenotypical traits were analyzed, with the study determining that that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> and light eyes in Mexicans was of 18.5% and 28.5% respectively, ...|$|E
2500|$|... making Mexico {{also the}} country with the second highest {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> in the study. The reason behind such discrepancy between phenotypical traits and genetic ancestry may lie in the low African contribution found within the Mexican population relative to Brazil and Colombia. In addition, the samples used in Mexico's case were highly unproportional, as the northern and western regions of Mexico contain 45% of Mexico's population, but no more than 10% of the samples used in the study came from the states located in these regions. For the most part, the rest of the samples hailed from Mexico City and southern Mexican states.|$|E

2500|$|On August 13, 1997, Butters first {{appeared}} as a background character when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". For the episode, the character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated {{through the use of}} stop motion. Since then, like all other characters on the show, Butters has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed {{to give the impression that}} the show still utilizes its original technique. In the tradition of the show's animation style, Butters is composed of simple geometrical shapes and colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion. Butters has a large tuft <b>of</b> <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> on top of his head, and is usually depicted wearing an aquamarine jacket with dark green pants and black shoes. When voicing Butters, Stone speaks within his normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection, a slight stutter, and a Southern accent. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E

6000|$|A small, dark man, dapper and debonair, swallow-tailed and top-hatted, was waltzing {{about the}} stage with dainty, mincing steps, and in a thin little voice singing {{something}} or other about somebody or something evidently pathetic.
