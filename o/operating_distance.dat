2500|$|... 28 January 2015 - The EU Horizon 2020 {{administration}} has {{confirmed that the}} 17 million € application for a demonstration E-ferry {{is now in the}} state of Grant Agreement - meaning that the partners in the Horizon application now have 3 months to finish contracting for the subsidies. The objective of the Green Ferry Vision is to perform a feasibility study for the design, production and operation of an innovative low weight ferry for cars and passengers - a ferry only powered by green electricity stored on batteries on board. The ferry design will be well beyond state-of-the-art when it comes to charging powers and capable <b>operating</b> <b>distance.</b> The ferry is to be completed in 2017 with Søby Værft as contractor.|$|E

5000|$|In 1955 Leonid Kupriyanovich {{published}} {{the description of}} a simple walkie-talkie amateur radio station for personal use in the Soviet amateur radio magazine [...] "Radio," [...] 1955, N2. It operated on two vacuum tubes. The walkie-talkie weighed about 1,2 kg and had 1,5 km <b>operating</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{wireless}} resonant inductive devices operate at low milliwatt power levels and are battery powered. Others operate at higher kilowatt power levels. Current implantable medical and road electrification device designs achieve more than 75% transfer efficiency at an <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> between the transmit and receive coils {{of less than}} 10 cm.|$|E

50|$|SWT also <b>operates</b> longer <b>distance</b> {{services}} {{as far as}} Weymouth, Portsmouth, Bristol and Exeter.|$|R
50|$|There {{were later}} {{models of the}} device, some with more complex {{internal}} structure (the center post under the membrane attached to a helix, probably to increase Q). Maximizing the Q-factor {{was one of the}} engineering priorities, as this allowed higher selectivity to the illuminating signal frequency, and therefore higher <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> and also higher acoustic sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{positioning}} systems can yield an accuracy {{of a few}} centimeters to tens of meters {{and can be used}} over <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> from tens of meters to tens of kilometers. Performance depends strongly on the type and model of the positioning system, its configuration for a particular job, and the characteristics of the underwater acoustic environment at the work site.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Leonid Kupriyanovich {{presented}} a pocket automatic radio phone which could {{fit in the}} palm of a hand. This pocket mobile phone weighed only 70 g and had 80 km <b>operating</b> <b>distance.</b> Kupriyanovich told correspondents of the АПН news agency that in the USSR the production of this device was planned. He also reported the plans for the construction in Moscow of ten base stations for creation of a mobile communication network. The first station in Moscow was planned to be constructed in Mazilovo.|$|E

50|$|The {{range of}} the Minitor's <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> depends on the {{strength}} ("wattage") of the paging transmitter. A repeater {{is often used to}} improve paging coverage, as it can be located for better range than the dispatch center where the page originates from. Weather conditions, low battery, and even atmospheric conditions can affect the Minitor's ability to receive transmissions. In fact, a remote transmitter hundreds, even thousands of miles away belonging to a separate agency, can activate a Minitor (and also block it) unknowingly if the atmospheric conditions let the signal propagate that far. This is commonly known as radio skip.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1957 {{he made an}} {{experimental}} model of a wearable automatic mobile phone ("radiophone"), called LK-1 (not {{to be confused with}} the cancelled Soviet spacecraft of the same name). His device consisted of a base station and a portable handset. LK-1 was 3 kg in weight, 20-30 km <b>operating</b> <b>distance,</b> and 20-30 hours of battery life. Leonid Kupriyanovich patented this mobile phone in 1957 (author's certificate № 115494, 1.11.1957). The base station, in accordance with author's description, could serve several customers. In 1958, Kupriyanovich made the new experimental [...] "pocket" [...] model mobile phone. This phone had 0,5 kg weight. To serve more customers, Kupriyanovich proposed the device, named it as a correllator.|$|E
5000|$|Sturgeon {{spent most}} of her career in the North Sea, off the Scandinavian coast. On 14 September 1939, she {{attacked}} her sister ship [...] with three torpedoes but they all missed. This took place off the coast of Norway. Because of this incident, the Admiralty increased the <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> of British submarines off Norway from 4 miles to 16 miles. She also attacked the German submarine , but failed to hit her. Sturgeon claimed her first success when she sank the German anti submarine trawler [...] (formerly Gauleiter Telshow) on 20 November 1939.The sinking of V-209 was the first successful attack on an enemy ship by a British submarine during the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|Following World War I new {{technology}} {{was developed to}} increase the range and performance of the radios being used to communicate with planes in the air. It was not until 1930 however that airborne radios were reliable enough and had enough power to make them viable to be standard in all planes. Until this point only planes designated for scout missions required radios. The <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> of radios increased much slower than the distance planes were able to travel. This resulted in planes messages having to bounce from airfield to airfield {{in order to get}} to its intended recipient. As the speed of planes increased this resulted in a plane reaching its destination before the message that it was on its way arrived at the airfield.|$|E

50|$|The MWIR band is {{preferred}} when inspecting high temperature objects and the LWIR band {{when working with}} near room temperature objects. Other important criteria for band selection are: the <b>operating</b> <b>distance,</b> indoor-outdoor operation, temperature and emissivity of the bodies of interest. For instance, long wavelengths (LWIR) are preferred for outdoor operation since they are less affected by radiation from the Sun. LWIR cameras are typically uncooled systems using Focal Plane Array microbolometers commonly used in industrial IR applications, although cooled LWIR cameras using Mercury Cadmium Tellurium (MCT) detectors exists as well. On the contrary, {{the majority of the}} MWIR cameras require cooling, using either liquid nitrogen or a Stirling cycle cooler. Cooling to approximately −196 °C (77 K) offers excellent thermal resolution, but might restrict the span of applications to controlled environments.|$|E
5000|$|PAVA spray is an incapacitant spray {{dispensed}} from {{a hand-held}} canister in a liquid stream. It contains a 0.3% solution of pelargonic acid vanillylamide (PAVA), a synthetic capsaicinoid, in a solvent of aqueous ethanol. The propellant is nitrogen. This solution {{has been selected}} {{because this is the}} minimum concentration which will fulfil the purpose of the equipment; namely to minimise a person's capacity for resistance without unnecessarily prolonging their discomfort. PAVA is significantly more potent than CS gas.The liquid stream is a spray pattern and has a maximum effective range of up to 4 metres. Maximum accuracy, however, will be achieved over a distance of 1.25 [...] - [...] 2 metres. The <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> is the distance between the canister and the subject's eyes, not the distance between the user and the subject.|$|E
50|$|The Tanimachi Line has {{the longest}} <b>operating</b> <b>distance</b> (for {{the purpose of}} fare calculation) in the Osaka subway network, after the Midōsuji Line (although the latter would be the longest in the Osaka subway network if the Kita-Osaka Kyūkō Railway section of the Midōsuji Line was taken into account).
