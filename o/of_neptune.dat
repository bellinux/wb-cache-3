5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius <b>of</b> <b>Neptune).</b> Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{seasonal}} changes, the cloud bands {{in the southern}} hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 {{and is expected to}} last until about 2020. The long orbital period <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> results in seasons lasting forty years.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins {{to slow the}} solar wind, occurs {{at a distance of}} 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius <b>of</b> <b>Neptune.</b> The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius <b>of</b> <b>Neptune,</b> and likely much farther.|$|E

5|$|Despite Pluto's orbit {{appearing}} to cross that <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> {{when viewed from}} directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned {{so that they can}} never collide or even approach closely.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E

5|$|The moons <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> can {{be divided}} into two groups: regular and irregular. The first group {{includes}} the seven inner moons, which follow circular prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane <b>of</b> <b>Neptune.</b> The second group consists of all seven other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.|$|E
5|$|The rings <b>of</b> <b>Neptune,</b> {{like those}} of Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, {{like those of}} Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

50|$|The IACHR found {{numerous}} other violations <b>of</b> <b>Neptune’s</b> human rights. Given the state courts’ lack <b>of</b> jurisdiction, <b>Neptune’s</b> rights against illegal imprisonment and arbitrary detention were violated. Because Neptune was jailed for 14 months before receiving {{a statement of}} the charges against him, the State violated his right to be informed within a reasonable time {{of the charges against}} him. And because the case against him has still not been resolved—more than four years after Neptune was imprisoned—the State stands in violation <b>of</b> <b>Neptune’s</b> right to be judged within a reasonable amount of time.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{prominent}} {{examples of}} secular resonance involve Saturn. A resonance between the precession of Saturn's rotational axis and that <b>of</b> <b>Neptune's</b> orbital axis (both {{of which have}} periods of about 1.87 million years) {{has been identified as}} the likely source of Saturn's large axial tilt (26.7°). Initially, Saturn probably had a tilt closer to that of Jupiter (3.1°). The gradual depletion of the Kuiper belt would have decreased the precession rate <b>of</b> <b>Neptune's</b> orbit; eventually, the frequencies matched, and Saturn's axial precession was captured into the spin-orbit resonance, leading to an increase in Saturn's obliquity. (The angular momentum <b>of</b> <b>Neptune's</b> orbit is 104 times that of Saturn's spin, and thus dominates the interaction.) ...|$|R

5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon <b>of</b> <b>Neptune,</b> is probably a captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{distance}} <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually.

5|$|In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{to predict}} {{the position of the}} then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.

5|$|Most short-period comets {{belong to}} the Jupiter family—defined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Neptune.</b> During close {{encounters}} with Jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Observation <b>of</b> <b>Neptune</b> in the {{radio-frequency}} band {{shows that}} it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts.
