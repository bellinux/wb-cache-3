50|$|Six-person <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> (or OC6) {{are among}} the most common used for sport use; single-person <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> (or OC1) are also very common.

50|$|The {{technology}} has persisted {{into the modern}} age. <b>Outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> can be quite large fishing or transport vessels. In the Philippines, <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> (called bangka, parao or balanghai) are often fitted with petrol engines. The links between seafaring and <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> in the Philippines extend through to political life, in which the smallest political unit {{in the country is}} still called Barangay after the historical Balangay outrigger proas used in the original migrations of the first Austronesian peoples across the archipelago and beyond.|$|R

25|$|The {{maritime}} prowess {{was recorded}} in a Borobudur bas relief of Borobudur ship, the 8th century wooden double outrigger vehicles of Maritime Southeast Asia. The function of an outrigger is to stabilise the ship. The single or double <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoe</b> is the typical feature of the seafaring Austronesians vessels and the most likely type of vessel used for the voyages and explorations across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Indian Ocean. The ships depicted at Borobudur most likely were the type of vessels used for inter-insular trades and naval campaigns by Sailendra and Srivijaya.|$|E
500|$|The story {{centers around}} Max Havoc (Mickey Hardt), an ex-kickboxing {{champion}} known as [...] "Mad Max", turned globetrotting sports photographer. Max quit kickboxing after accidentally killing a fellow boxer during an unlikely comeback in the ring, but still suffers from flashbacks to the fight. After a bar scuffle over a biker girl (Nikki Ziering), his agent (Diego Walraff) sends him to Guam for a publicity photo shoot. There, Max encounters Tahsi (Richard Roundtree), his former kickboxing coach, now an antiques dealer, {{and promises to}} catch up with him later. While photographing an <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoe</b> race from a jet ski, Max rescues Christy Goody (Tawney Sablan), a vacationer who was about to be unwittingly run over by the canoes. In the process, he knocks over one of the canoes, earning the wrath its head rower, Moko (Pyun veteran Vincent Klyn). He is also admonished by Jane (Joanna Krupa), Christy's sister, for his brazen driving. However, she later apologizes and agrees to a dinner date.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} to <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes,</b> trimarans typically feature a sail (or engine) {{and are not}} primarily designed to be paddled. Trimarans are typically significantly wider. In addition, trimaran floats are much more buoyant than those of <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> to support a large sailplan. They contribute to drag when heavily immersed, and their level of immersion indicates when to reef..|$|R

50|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>canoes</b> were {{originally}} {{developed by the}} Austronesian-speaking peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia for sea travel. They were used to transport these peoples both eastward to Polynesia and New Zealand and westward across the Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar during the Austronesian migration period. While today they {{can be found in}} East Africa (e.g. the ungalawa of Tanzania), the Austronesian peoples (Filipino, Malay, Micronesian, Melanesian and Polynesian peoples) continue to be the primary users of the <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Sand volleyball was {{apparently}} born in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, at the <b>Outrigger</b> <b>Canoe</b> Club. According to a 1978 interview of an <b>Outrigger</b> <b>Canoe</b> Club member, George David [...] "Dad" [...] Center put a net up there, {{and the first}} recorded game of beach volleyball took place. In 1920, new jetties in Santa Monica, California created a large sandy area for public enjoyment, planting the seed for beach volleyball development in that region. The first permanent nets began to appear, and people soon began playing recreational games on public parts of the beach and in private beach clubs. Eleven such beach clubs appeared in the Santa Monica area, beginning in late 1922. The first inter-club competitions were staged in 1924.|$|E

At the time the college was still at Newington House and Celua arrived with [...] "two native servants and a huge <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoe,</b> which became for the boys a source of great fun" [...] on the Parramatta River.

2500|$|In April 1943, an Army bomber piloted by Harmon, and nicknamed [...] "Old 98" [...] after Harmon's {{football}} jersey number, {{crashed into}} the South American jungle while en route to North Africa. Harmon {{reported that he had}} been flying through heavy rain turbulence for two hours. When Harmon tried to fly the plane to an opening in the weather, there was a sharp crack from the right wing and engine, and Harmon was unable to pull the plane from a steep dive. After ordering his crew to bail out, Harmon parachuted from the plane at 1,500 feet. He ended up in a tree 20 yards from where his plane crashed. Out of a crew of six, Harmon was the sole survivor of the crash and spent several days working his way through jungle and swamp. He ultimately came upon natives in Dutch Guinea who escorted him in a dugout canoe to a village where he was taken by <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoe</b> to a base of the Antilles Air Command.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{comparative}} studies is suggested, focused on perceptions of <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes,</b> and aimed at an increased {{understanding of the}} relationship between social relations, biodiversity, and sustainable development in Oceanic societies on small islands and in coastal areas undergoing rapid cultural change. After a critique of the recent notion that canoe-building in Polynesia developed as a result of natural selection, and after discussing the declining local interest in <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoes,</b> it is argued that these canoes can be regarded as a "total social phenomenon" or "fact", in Marcel Mauss' sense of the term. By focusing on such a phenomenon/fact, it is possible to understand many other societal aspects to which it is connected, including gender relations, social structure, religion, perceptions of nature, economy, relationships between centre and periphery, and cultural change.

2500|$|These {{wayfinding}} techniques, {{along with}} <b>outrigger</b> <b>canoe</b> construction methods, were kept as guild secrets. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; {{in times of}} famine or difficulty these navigators could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. On his first voyage of Pacific exploration Cook had {{the services of a}} Polynesian navigator, Tupaia, who drew a hand-drawn chart of the islands within [...] radius (to the north and west) of his home island of Ra'iatea. Tupaia had knowledge of 130 islands and named 74 on his chart. Tupaia had navigated from Ra'iatea in short voyages to 13 islands. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather's time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans has diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia. [...] His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. As the Admiralty orders directed Cook to search for the “Great Southern Continent”, Cook ignored Tupaia's chart and his skills as a navigator. To this day, original traditional methods of Polynesian Navigation are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
