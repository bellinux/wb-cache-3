5|$|In December 1944 Fleming {{was posted}} on an {{intelligence}} fact-finding {{trip to the}} Far East {{on behalf of the}} Director of Naval Intelligence.

5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve {{as something of a}} mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
30|$|For the {{comparison}} {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> risk assessment, <b>the</b> categorization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> into three risk levels: high (red), intermediate (yellow) or moderate (green) was used. In the initial blind stage, the IVDR risk classifications were higher (indicating a higher risk level) than the SR in 47  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> categories were equal in 45  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> risk category recorded by the IVDR was lower than the self-reported one in only 8  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> In <b>the</b> cool-off stage, risk levels reported by the IVDR were higher than the SR in 30  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases and equal in 70  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases. There were no {{cases in which the}} IVDR reported a lower risk level.|$|R
30|$|The {{data used}} for this {{evaluation}} includes all <b>the</b> 156 <b>trips</b> (50 in <b>the</b> “blind profile” stage and 106 in the “cooling-off” stage) that were matched between the IVDR and SR. The data was pooled {{in order to increase}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> relevant observations in each case. The drivers reported that 40 (26  %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> were for leisure purposes and that passengers were present in the vehicle in 81 (52  %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> IVDR classified 91 (61  %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> as moderate (green), 25 (16  %) as intermediate (yellow) and 35 (23  %) as aggressive (red).|$|R

5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader was happy to comply. During the planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> many points on Earth had not been captured on film from {{the air and the}} American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights, as they were trying to build an aerial collection. Light's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as the worst part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b> According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

40|$|This Article traces <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>TRIPs</b> Agreement and explores why {{less developed}} countries were dissatisfied with the international intellectual property system.

It contends that, while none of these narratives is complete, each of them provides valuable insight into understanding the context in which the Agreement was created. The Article then explores why {{less developed countries}} have been dissatisfied with the international intellectual property system and discusses latest developments in the area, such as the recent WTO debacle in Cancun, <b>the</b> proliferation <b>of</b> bilateral and plurilateral free trade agreements, and <b>the</b> increasing use <b>of</b> technological protection measures.

5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> {{was that he would}} be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E

The {{decision to use}} a ship instead of self-deploying was made because of concerns over icing during the North Atlantic portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> lack of available KC-130s for mid-air refueling, and the Wasps availability.|$|E

5|$|Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 {{reported}} Kalākaua's tour expense {{appropriated by}} the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy {{for the education of}} the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno.

5|$|According to {{a report}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor {{had to be done}} with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E
5|$|Calgary ended 2010 {{with three}} {{consecutive}} wins and won their first game in 2011 for a season-high four-game winning streak.

Losses to Vancouver, Detroit and Carolina followed, the latter two in overtime, but the Flames' four-game eastern road trip that began in Carolina ended with the team registering two wins and six points. The last game <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> against the Montreal Canadiens, saw the team come back from a 4–0 deficit to force the contest into overtime before Montreal prevailed. Kiprusoff struggled throughout the road trip, and was jeered by the fans on the team's first game home, a 6–0 loss to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested that the purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he {{had fallen in love with}} her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1764, five Cherokee visited Timberlake, seeking an {{audience}} with the governor of Virginia and requesting passage to London. The Cherokee wished to appeal to King George to enforce the Proclamation Line of 1763, which restricted colonists to east of the Appalachians, due to continuing encroachment by white settlers on Cherokee land. The governor denied their request, but Timberlake agreed to help them. He accompanied three Cherokee to London {{in the fall of}} 1764. Not long after their arrival, the benefactor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> fell ill and died. Lord Halifax refused to grant the Cherokee an audience, as the trip was unauthorized. Timberlake was accused of attempting to profit off the public attention given to the Cherokee. The government sent the Cherokee back to North America in March 1765. Shortly after their departure, Timberlake was arrested for failing to pay the debt for the last bill for lodging of himself and the Cherokee. He likely wrote his Memoirs while incarcerated.|$|E

The ship was completed {{less than a year}} later, on 19 February 1906. The ship conducted an extensive shakedown cruise and sea trials before steaming to Hampton Roads, where she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron, Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1907. She left Hampton Roads on 9 March 1907, bound for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There, she {{and the rest of the}} 1st Squadron conducted maneuvers and gunnery training. After the conclusion of these exercises, she returned to the east coast of the United States for a cruise to Cape Cod Bay. On 8 December, Rhode Island returned to Hampton Roads, where she and fifteen other battleships held a naval review at the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet. The battleships were joined by transports and a squadron of torpedo boats.
