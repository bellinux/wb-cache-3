Two sets of experiments were conducted involving both sawdust and rice husk as bulking agents, which were composted in self-heating reactors with potato-peel industrial waste and grass clippings as organic materials. The main variables observed over time were temperature, <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rate (OUR), <b>biodegradability,</b> and germination index (GI). The effects of compost water extracts on seed germination and primary root growth of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) were measured to calculate the germination index (GI). The biodegradability was well assessed by measuring lignin content, using the Klason method. The experimental results showed that initial compositions strongly determined the profiles of phytotoxicity and the period of maturation. The phytotoxicity assessment in the experiments with sawdust revealed that after 39 days of composting, the GI attained the maximum value of 30 %, but using rice husk, {{it was possible to}} reach 70 % in the same period of time.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{compared}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> {{before and}} after the onset of claudication in individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) during a 6 -minute walk test, and identified predictors of the change in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> after the onset of claudication pain. MethodsThe study included 50 individuals with PAD. During a 6 -minute walk test, 33 experienced claudication (pain group), and 17 were pain-free (pain-free group). <b>Oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> and ambulatory cadence were the primary outcomes evaluated during the 6 -minute walk test. ResultsThe pain group experienced onset of claudication pain at a mean (standard deviation) of 179 (45) meters and continued to walk to achieve a 6 -minute walk distance of 393 (74) meters, which was similar to the 401 (76) meters walked in the pain-free group (P =. 74). <b>Oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> increased (P <. 0001) after the onset of pain in the pain group, and this change was greater (P =. 025) than the increase in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> from the second to fifth minutes of walking in the pain-free group. Ambulatory cadence decreased after the onset of pain in the pain group (P =. 0003). The change in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was associated with metabolic syndrome (P =. 0023), 6 -minute walk distance (P =. 0037), age (P =. 0041), and <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during the second minute of the test (P =. 012).

40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> {{increases}} linearly {{with increased}} running speed or {{rate of work}} and finally reaches a maximum beyond which no effort can drive it further. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} the plateau in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> The classical and generally accepted view is that the maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> plateau is limited by the central circulation s inability to distribute sufficient oxygen to all the working muscles. Throughout history several different theories have been proposed as limitation causes to maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake,</b> principally Central vs. Peripheral limitations. Even though there is more than 80 years of scientific investigation of maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake,</b> there is still no unarguable agreement regarding the fundamental question: What sets the upper limit for maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during exercise involving a large muscle mass? More than a decade ago a new theory named Central Governor was proposed to challenge the classical concept of maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> It suggested that the absence of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> plateau in a few studies was enough evidence to support that the oxygen delivery system was not a limiting factor for maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> This theory has been criticized by many physiologists who have provided important evidence for the classical concept of maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> The theory also states that the governor reduces the neuronal output to the heart and active muscles in order to protect these tissues from becoming ischemic. Therefore, the main purposes of this Licentiate thesis were: 1) To determine and investigate the importance of the work of the heart as a limiting factor in the attainment of maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during maximal or supramaximal workloads, 2) To elucidate the relationship between maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during maximal and supramaximal workloads and the neuronal output to active skeletal muscles in order to evaluate the model of regulation of the Central Governor theory. The main hypothesis was that after different combined arm and leg exercises with different maximal work rates, the mechanical work of the heart and the active skeletal muscles would not be hindered by a command from the central nervous system. Sixteen subjects, healthy, endurance trained males participated in the studies. Three different maximal combined arm and leg exercises were used to determine maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>uptake,</b> pulmonary ventilation and heart rate were measured continuously. Electrocardiography signals were recorded in the end of every maximal exercise. Blood samples were taken and electromyography activities were measured during exercise at various time points. The main findings were: 1) During all the maximal combined arm and leg exercises, despite large variations in maximal work rates there was a clear plateau in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> both with rate of work and with time for all participants. 2) During the plateau phase both the electromyography activity of the activated muscles and the work of the heart increased with increased rate of work without any increase in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake.</b> These studies support the classical view of a limitation of maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> in the central circulation. This limitation refers to the hearts inability to pump more blood at increasing exercise levels and not the mechanical work of the heart or the heart muscle energetic insufficiency. Furthermore, these data do not support a maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> limitation based on the Central Governor theory...|$|R

When saliva was mixed with an acidic buffer {{in the presence}} of 0. 1 mM AA, rapid nitric oxide formation and <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> were observed. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was due to the oxidation of nitric oxide, which was formed by AA-dependent reduction of nitrite under acidic conditions, by molecular oxygen. A salivary component SCN− enhanced the nitric oxide formation and <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> by the AA/nitrite system. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> by the AA/nitrite/SCN− system was also observed in an acidic buffer solution. These results suggest that oxygen is normally taken up in the stomach when saliva and gastric juice are mixed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the link between}} peak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> and regional body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in Japanese subjects. MethodsA total of 93 men (42. 2  ±  12. 3 years old) and 106 women (43. 5  ±  12. 3 years old) were enrolled in this cross-sectional investigation study. Peak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> {{was measured by the}} breath-by-breath method. Regional body composition i. e., body fat mass, lean body mass, and body fat percentage was evaluated using DEXA. In addition, metabolic risk parameters were also evaluated. ResultsPeak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was 37. 6  ±  8. 7  mL/kg/min in men and 31. 1  ±  6. 4  mL/kg/min in women, and decreased with age in both genders. Peak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was significantly correlated with total body fat percentage (men: r = − 0. 684, p <  0. 0001; women: r = − 0. 681, p <  0. 0001). These associations remained even after adjusting for age and total lean body mass. However, peak work rate was positively and significantly correlated with leg lean body mass. ConclusionPeak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was closely correlated with total body fat percentage in both genders. Aerobic exercise as well as leg resistance training might be useful for improving peak <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> in Japanese subjects...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{study of}} the effect of mixing on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rate of estuarine bottom {{deposits}} is presented. The method of study involved the mixing of samples of bottom deposits with the overlying water to result in concentrations of suspended matter in the same order as observed in the estuary. Some samples were kept in a quiescent state as a control and the others mixed to concentrations of 30 to 50 mg/ 1 suspended matter. The effect of depth and the non-biological oxygen demand are presented with a discussion of the source of biochemical oxygen demand. Results of this study showed that: 1. Mixing has a pronounced effect on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rate. 2. The results tend to confirm that the increase in <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> is due to the release of bio-degradable substances from the bottom. 3. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> of benthic gases appears to be small compared to the total <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rate. 4, The depth of deposit has no effect on <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> between the depths of two and 12 inches. 5. The possibility of a material having a high decay rate coefficient being released from the bottom deposit warrants further investigation. 6. The change in concentration of matter suspended from the surface of deposits in the order of 100 mg per liter appears to have no apparent effect on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rate of water overlying the deposits...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} walking economy and physiological responses at two walking speeds in males with similar absolute body mass but different body composition. Methods. The study involved 22 young men with similar absolute body mass, BMI, aerobic performance, calf and thigh circumference. The participants differed in body composition: body fat (HBF group) and lean body mass (HLBM group). In the graded test, maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> (VO 2 max) and maximal heart rate were measured. Walking economy was evaluated during two walks performed at two different speeds (4. 8 and 6. 0 km ‧ h- 1). Results. The VO 2 max was similar in both groups, as were the physiological responses during slow walking. The absolute <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> or <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> relative to body mass did not significantly differentiate the studied groups. The only indicator significantly differentiating the two groups was <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> relative to LBM. Conclusions. Body composition does not significantly affect walking economy at low speed, while during brisk walking, the economy is better in the HLBM vs. HBF group, provided that walking economy is presented as <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> relative to LBM. For this reason, we recommend this manner of <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> normalization in the evaluation of walking economy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} follow the time pattern of <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> and {{recovery}} for supramaximal work of short duration, 35 male subjects (mean age 21. 4 years, mean body weight 71. 9 kg) pedalled abicycle rgometer at maximal speed for t rain. A constant frictional resistance of 5. 5 kg was used, {{resulting in a total}} work output of 2890 kpm (85 revolutions, SD = 7. 5). The total percent decrement in work output from the initial rate on this test was 59. 7 %. The total <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during the work averaged 2. 351, the net oxygen recovery was 4. 891, while the net work efficiency was t 9. 3 %. One and two component exponential curves fit the observed <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> and recovery measures {{with a high degree of}} aecuraey. Comparison of the curve parameters with published ata showed large differences for the post exercise oxygen recovery and the slow component ofthe recovery curve. The magni-tude of the fast component of recovery was similar to other data. The total <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> during the test was found to be t 0 % lower than the maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> determined on a seperate progressive step-increment test. It was shown, by curve analysis, that the maximal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> would have been reached in approximately 2 rain...|$|R
40|$|Shelf sediments play a {{vital role}} in global {{biogeochemical}} cycling and are particularly important areas of oxygen consumption and carbon mineralisation. Total benthic <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake,</b> the sum of diffusive and faunal mediated uptake, is a robust proxy to quantify carbon mineralisation. However, <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rates are dynamic, due to the diagenetic processes within the sediment, and can be spatially and temporally variable. Four benthic sites in the Celtic Sea, encompassing gradients of cohesive to permeable sediments, were sampled over four cruises to capture seasonal and spatial changes in oxygen dynamics. Total <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> (TOU) rates were measured through a suite of incubation experiments and oxygen microelectrode profiles were taken across all four benthic sites to provide the oxygen penetration depth and diffusive <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> (DOU) rates. The difference between TOU and DOU allowed for quantification of the fauna mediated <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> and diffusive uptake. High resolution measurements showed clear seasonal and spatial trends, with higher <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> rates measured in cohesive sediments compared to the permeable sediment. The significant differences in oxygen dynamics between the sediment types were consistent between seasons, with increasing oxygen consumption during and after the phytoplankton bloom. Carbon mineralisation in shelf sediments is strongly influenced by sediment type and seasonality...|$|R
