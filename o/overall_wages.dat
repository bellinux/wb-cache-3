40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} European Community Household Panel to explore the {{connection}} between education, over-education, and wage inequality in Spain for the period 1994 - 2001. Our central approach is based on quantile regression. We find that higher education is associated with higher wage dispersion. This indicates that an educational expansion towards higher education is expected, ceteris paribus, to increase <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> inequality. We find that over-education contributes to enlarge wage differentials within university graduates. Still, over-education itself {{can not account for}} the positive association between higher education and wage dispersion. Finally, we show that over the last years the wage distribution of over-educated workers with university education became more dispersed. This process, together with an increasing proportion of over-educated workers, contributed to rise <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> inequality through the within dimension. ...|$|R

Using rich data on tasks performed in occupations, we propose the concept of task-specific human capital to measure the transferability of skills empirically. Our results on occupational mobility and wages show that labor market skills are more portable than previously considered. We find that individuals move to occupations with similar task requirements and that the distance of moves declines with time {{in the labor}} market. We also show that task-specific human capital is an important source of individual wage growth, in particular for university graduates. For them, at least 40 percent of <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> growth over a ten year period can be attributed to task-specific human capital. For the low- and medium-skilled, task-specific human capital accounts for at least 35 and 25 percent of <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> growth respectively...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{portrait of the}} level and compliance with sectoral minimum wages in Italy between 2008 and 2015. The results show that wage floors in Italy are relatively high both in absolute terms and relative to the median wage. However, non-compliance rates are not negligible: on average, around 10 % of workers are paid 20 % less than the minimum wage established in their reference collective agreement. Non-compliance is particularly high in the South and in micro and small firms, and it affects especially women and temporary workers. <b>Overall,</b> <b>wages</b> {{in the bottom of}} the distribution appear to be largely unaffected by minimum wage increases. More effective enforcement practices are therefore needed to safeguard a level playing field for firms and ensure that minimum wage increases are effectively reflected in pay increases for workers at the bottom of the distribution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} famous Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) {{discrimination}} analysis in several directions. First the wage difference breakdown {{is not limited}} to two groups. Second a decomposition technique is proposed that allows analyzing the determinants of the <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> dispersion. The approach presented combines two techniques. The first one is popular in the field of income inequality measurement and concerns the breakdown of inequality by population subgroups. The second one, very common in the labor economics literature, uses Mincerian earnings functions to derive a decomposition of wage differences into components measuring respectively group differences in the average values of the explanatory variables, in the coefficients of these variables in the earnings functions and in the unobservable characteristics. This methodological novelty allows one to determine the exact impact of each of these three elements on the <b>overall</b> <b>wage</b> dispersion, on the dispersion within and between groups and on the degree of overlap between the wage distributions of the various groups. ...|$|R
