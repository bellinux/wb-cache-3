5000|$|Tontines soon caused {{problems}} for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended {{to underestimate the}} longevity of the population. At first, tontine holders included {{men and women of}} all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to game the system, and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as [...] "penny policies", a predecessor of the 20th-century pension scheme.|$|E

50|$|Third, a 529 {{plan can}} provide a very easy {{hands-off}} way to save for college. Once one decides which 529 plan to use, one completes a simple enrollment form and makes a contribution (or signs up for automatic deposits). The ongoing investment of the account is handled by the plan, not by the donor. Plan assets are professionally managed either by the state treasurer's office or by an outside investment company hired as the program manager. The donor will not receive a Form 1099 to report taxable or nontaxable earnings until {{the year of the}} withdrawals. If an investment switch is desired, donors may change to a different option in a 529 savings program every year (program permitting) or the account may be rolled over to a different state's program provided no such rollover for the beneficiary has occurred in the prior 12 months. 529 plans generally have very low minimum start-up and contribution requirements. The fees, compared with <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles,</b> are low, although this depends on the state administering the plan. Finally, everyone is eligible {{to take advantage of a}} 529 plan, and the amounts that can be put in are substantial (over $300,000 per beneficiary in many state plans).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{a review of}} {{developments}} in the fund of funds (FoF) industry as well as related academic research work. Since the genesis {{of this sort of}} financial product in the 1960 s, huge capital inflows have generated a total of US $ 1, 200 billion of worldwide FoF assets under management as of year-end 2007. Being portfolios built out of other portfolios and assets, FoFs are a special type of investments and therefore have distinct advantages and disadvantages in comparison with <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles.</b> When reviewing both the academic research related to the unique, or at least distinct, features of FoFs and discussing market developments, we address a good number of interesting questions and challenges. Specifically, we find that classical methods of research and assessment may be insufficient to address these questions in both theoretical and quantitative aspects. The need for a distinct treatment of FoFs is even more evident when focusing on the dynamic nature of financial market developments and increasing global competitiveness. As past research work on FoFs is scarce...|$|E
40|$|The {{embedded}} options {{found in}} some securities {{are known to have}} significant impact on product pricing, secondary market valuation, and risk measurement and management. The option to withdraw commonly found in bank deposits is one of the least studied of these. We help to fill this gap by examining the level and interest rate sensitivity of early withdrawals of retail time deposits using panel data from the Thrift Financial Report. We find that longer-maturity time deposit portfolios commonly experience early withdrawals at economically significant levels. Further, we find that depositors respond positively, with increased levels of early withdrawal, to the reinvestment incentive they face when new deposit rates rise. These findings increase our understanding of consumer behavior with regard to financial products and have significant implications for the competitive pricing of deposit products and the management of bank interest rate risk. Banking changed significantly during the 1980 s and 1990 s, as financial markets became increasingly volatile and competition—both interbank and between commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other financial service providers—grew. 1 After years of losing depositors to mutual funds and <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> and losing borrowers to the increasingly accessible commercial paper an...|$|E

[...] Because of the relatively high cost of HDHPs, the increased out-of-pocket costs can be burdensome especially for low income families.

40|$|Comparative {{performance}} analysis on all property <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{is necessary for}} investment decision-making. However, published studies have yet to evaluate the performance of direct commercial properties against the <b>other</b> available property <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Malaysia. This paper addresses the research gap by analyzing the performance of all direct property and indirect property <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Malaysia from 2001 - 2010. Direct property vehicles are benchmarked by Malaysia House Price Indices (terraced, high-rise, detached and semi-detached houses), while commercial properties represented by Retail Index and Office Index. Indirect property vehicles are proxied by Kuala Lumpur Property Index (KLPI) and Malaysia Real Estate Investment Trust Index (M-REIT). The sample period is further categorized into pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis according to Malaysian economic cycle. Vehicle performance is based on risk-adjusted return calculated using Sharpe Ratio. The results show that KLPI had highest average quarterly return and risk characteristics throughout the entire timeframe. In terms of risk-adjusted return, Retail Index outperformed all property <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> followed by semi-detached house investment throughout the entire sample period. Direct retail property investment {{would be the best}} choice for crisis and non-crisis period. It is also recommended to invest in M-REIT during crisis to minimize the impact of the downturn...|$|R
40|$|Loan-based crowdfunding, {{which is}} already well {{established}} in the US and Britain and is a new phenomenon in the Spanish market, is an <b>investment</b> <b>vehicle</b> for retail investors and institutional funds and also an interesting financial product for the small and medium enterprise segment (henceforth, SME). The recent regulation of crowdfunding in Spain (called “inclusive finance platforms” in the corresponding legislation) increases transparency and legal certainty for both investors and companies requiring credit; it establishes a legal framework, specifies the entities authorised to act as platforms, and clarifies the rules applying to the various stakeholders. This standard should promote the consolidation of this new mechanism of financial disintermediation based on the new technologies. It {{is likely to increase}} the number of financial suppliers in Spain and in Europe as a whole where, unlike the US market with its financial diversification, the capital market is characterised by its dependency on the traditional banking system. The inefficiency that this creates in the financial market has an adverse impact on the financial structures of the SME segment and, as a result, on its productivity, employment, and returns. In this situation, loan-based crowdfunding may be part of the solution. Through the collection of empirical data from a crowdfunding reference platform in Spain, this article analyses the profitability-risk trade off of crowdfunding and compares loan-based-crowdfunding with <b>other</b> traditional <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as <b>investment</b> funds, equities and pension funds. In addition, the fac tors that explain the cost of capital for loans, in particular loan maturity and company credit rating, are identified through a regression model.
