5|$|After Palmyra's {{destruction}} in 273, {{it became a}} market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by {{the discovery of a}} large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, the 24th Division played an {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Hunter's column lost eighty {{killed and}} wounded, while the {{quantity}} of Mahdist casualties {{is estimated to be}} between 250 and 850. The Mahdist commander, Mohammed Zain, was captured in the fighting. Soon after news of the victory spread, work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> railway was resumed and Abu Hamed reached on October 31, where Major-General Hunter and his column had remained. With the completion of the railway across the Nubian Desert, Kitchener's general advance into the heartland of Mahdist Sudan was guaranteed, and the greatest issue of Kitchener's campaign, supply, resolved.|$|E
5|$|The main Axis {{opposition}} was Kampfgruppe von Herff, positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the Trento Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of Bersaglieri—well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> flank, 2RTR {{advanced}} {{with the}} 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received {{of up to}} 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and ASquadron 2RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One Panzer IV was disabled {{and the other two}} driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to mechanical failure. A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No2 Troop, destroying a Panzer III and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of ASquadron 2RTR began a reconnaissance patrol towards Sidi Azeiz.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> flank, ASquadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz {{was being}} {{monitored}} by Panzer Regiment5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, {{and reported that}} an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. ASquadron's patrol was interpreted {{as an attempt to}} concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and completely unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. In response, Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to join up with Cramer's Panzer Regiment8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.|$|E
5|$|While Rosas {{was away}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Desert</b> Campaign in October 1833, {{a group of}} Rosistas (Rosas's supporters) laid siege to Buenos Aires. Inside the city, Rosas's wife, Encarnación, {{assembled}} a contingent of associates to aid the besiegers. The Revolution of the Restorers, as the Rosista coup came to be known, forced the provincial governor Juan Ramón Balcarce to resign. In quick succession, Balcarce was followed by two others who presided over weak and ineffective governments. The Rosismo (Rosism) had become a powerful faction within the Federalist Party, and pressured other factions to accept a return of Rosas, endowed with dictatorial powers, {{as the only way}} to restore stability. The House of Representatives yielded, and on 7 March 1835, Rosas was reelected governor and invested with the suma del poder público (sum of public power).|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Desert</b> of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> planet, {{the search}} begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid {{complex is}} unusual as the outer {{sections}} of the mortuary temple are offset {{to the south of}} {{the eastern side of the}} complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
