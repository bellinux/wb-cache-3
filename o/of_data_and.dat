40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{clustering}} algorithm, IFD 1, {{based on a}} cluster model <b>of</b> <b>data</b> coefficients D <b>and</b> feature coefficients F.

Clustering is performed via an iterative optimization procedure to mutually reinforce {{the relationships between the}} coefficients. The mutually reinforcing optimization exploits the duality <b>of</b> the <b>data</b> <b>and</b> features and enable a simultaneous clustering <b>of</b> both <b>data</b> <b>and</b> features. We have shown the convergence property of the clustering algorithm and discussed its connections with various existential approaches. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic <b>and</b> real <b>data</b> sets show the effectiveness of IFD algorithm...|$|R
