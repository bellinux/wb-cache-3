5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> in physics.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge,</b> celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

40|$|The {{assertion}} {{about the}} peculiarly intricate and complex character of social phenomena has, {{in much of}} social discourse, a virtually uncontested tradition. A {{significant part of the}} premise about the complexity of social phenomena is the conviction that it complicates, perhaps even inhibits the development and application <b>of</b> social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Our paper explores the origins, the basis and the consequences of this assertion and asks in particular whether the classic complexity assertion still deserves to be invoked in analyses that ask about the production and the utilization <b>of</b> social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> in modern society. We refer {{to one of the most}} prominent and politically influential social scientific theories, John Maynard Keynes' economic theory as an illustration. We conclude that, the practical value <b>of</b> social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> is not necessarily dependent on a faithful, in the sense of complete, representation of (complex) social reality. Practical knowledge is context sensitive if not project bound. Social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> that wants to optimize its practicality has to attend and attach itself to elements of practical social situations that can be altered or are actionable by relevant actors. This chapter represents an effort to re-examine the relation between social reality, social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> and its practical application. There is a widely accepted view about the potential social utility <b>of</b> social <b>scientific</b> <b>knowledge</b> that invokes the peculiar complexity of social reality as an impediment to good theoretical comprehension and hence to its applicability...|$|R
