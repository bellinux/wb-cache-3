40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an agent-based {{model of the}} labor market. It simulates {{the market in the}} recent period at the aggregate level and {{at the level of the}} principal categories of labor, on the basis of the decisions of heterogeneous agents, firms and individuals, who interact. These decisions rely on individual computations of profits and utilities, although rationality is bounded in such a complex environment. The theoretical structure that underlies the decisions is the search concept. We apply this framework to the case of France in 2011. The model is at a scale of 1 / 4700. It is fairly detailed on the institutions of the labor market that constrain the agents' decisions. Finally it is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to reproduce a large number of variables of interest. The calibrated model presents a consistent accounting system of the gross flows of the individuals between the main states, employment, distinguishing <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>contracts</b> and fixed duration contracts, unemployment and inactivity. The simulation of the gross flows accounts enables us to analyze the patterns of mobility in a way that the observed statistics on gross flows, which are partial, cannot do. The model then characterizes the nature of the labor market under study, reproducing the high proportion of the fixed duration contracts in the hiring flows, and it points to a dualism of the French labor market...|$|R
40|$|Temporary agency work in Britain has {{increased}} dramatically in recent years. Theoretical justification for this growth is centred upon an organisational need for greater efficiency {{as a result of}} increased competition in the marketplace. Cost advantages are often associated with the temporary nature of the agency contract and recent discussion suggests that recruitment of agency workers is a strategic practice, used to create competitive advantage. (Williamson 1985; Atkinson and Meager 1986; Matuski and Hill 1998; Lepak and Snell 1999; Houseman et al 2003). Organisationally sound manpower strategies are thus reasoned to be those that deliberately incorporate agency workers in a thoughtful, strategic and continually advantageous way. From this perspective, it is assumed that management control over the contractual nature of the workforce is essential, and failure to retain this autonomy would result in organisational inefficiency. This thesis critically examines this conjecture, by investigating a situation where management cannot actively select the contracts on which they employee their staff. In the case of two Social Services departments in London, management have lost the ability to strategically determine the contractual nature of their workforce, stating a strong preference for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>contracts,</b> but forced to deploy agency workers when permanent staff cannot be recruited. Previous suggestions would indicate detrimental implications, but in this instance it is argued that these blanket assumptions may facilitate premature conclusions, as the associated consequences of this situation of `unwanted flexibility' are unexplored.

40|$|National audienceThe El Khomri law (also called " Work law ") has {{triggered}} {{a lot of}} conflicting judgements among French economists in 2016. However no model {{has been used to}} evaluate its effects ex ante. We have developed over the past 10 years a calibrated agent-based model of the French labor market, in order understand better such a complex system, and do policy analysis and design. The model integrates the hetero-geneity of agents, and their decisions (firms and workers) based on a search theoretical framework to generate gross flows. It gives rational microeconomic foundations to behavior, albeit with decision rules using bounded rationality rather than optimal rules in an equilibrium with rational expectations which would not make sense in such a complex system. Instead agents form anticipations based both on their own history and a detailed algorithm is developed to model the firms'computation of expected in-tertemporal profits for different scenarios of future own demand, with the possibility of loss aversion, to decide on hiring or not, and the type of labor contracts. We introduce several main institutions of the labor market and specially the two main labor contracts, Open-Ended contracts and Fixed Term Contracts. The WorkSim model simulates the gross flows between inactivity, unemployment and these two types of employment, with a consistent accounting system. It is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to set 63 parameters in order to fit 64 aggregate real variables. The calibration reveals an important loss aversion on part of firms, which is determinant of the hiring decisions. If we experiment with a low loss aversion, the unemployment diminishes by several points. We then analyze the facilitation of the economic dismissals allowed by the El Khomri law. We find that it has little effect on global unemployment but benefits the young who crowd out the seniors. This result is based on the substitution by the employers of <b>Open</b> <b>Ended</b> <b>Contracts</b> which become more precarious to Fixed Duration Contracts which become less useful, and the fact that young workers are more often in Fixed Term Contracts than the other age categories.

40|$|International audienceThe Fixed Duration Contracts (FDC) {{have taken}} an {{importance}} place in the European labor markets, notably in France and Spain. They represent a dominant share of the hires, although most workers hold an <b>Open</b> <b>Ended</b> <b>Contract</b> (OEC) at any given date. There is then a permanent coexistence of {{the two types of}} contract that we explain through a trade-off that firms compute between their costs and benefits when deciding to open a vacancy. For the first time are taken simultanously into account for the OEC the firing costs, the advance notice costs, and the losses when the firm is unable to meet the legal requirements to initiate economic dismissals. For the FDC, the specific costs are the termination costs and the waiting cost when a new FDC cannot be opened immediately after a termination. Training and vacancy costs are common to both contracts and included but they are amortized over very different durations among the two contracts and these costs influence the trade-off. We extend WorkSim, an agent-based model of the French labor market which reproduces the gross flows of workers between the different states, employment (FDC and OEC), unemployment and inactivity. The theoretical framework is the costly search by the heterogenous agents, firms and individuals, who interact on the market, taking rationally bounded decisions but learning from their mistakes. The competition takes place in a labor stock-flow consistent framework, taking into account crowding out effects. The model is scaled and calibrated through a poweful algorithm to reach a steady state which reproduces the main observed variables in the labor market in the year 2011 with a correct fit. We generate the main effects of FDC, churning, screening, stepping stone, but also model in detail the buffer effect which is built on an option into an intertemporal decision framework with idiosyncratic anticipations of firms demand. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that pessimistic anticipations and the volatility of demand shocks raise the recourse to FDC but also unemployment. Increasing firing costs also raises unemployment but not in very significant way. Forbidding FDC does not change the employment significantly since the opposite effects of FDC seem to compensate each other. While the model puts into a unified framework the main theoretical ideas that yield the trade-off between FDC and OEC, and can be applied to different countries, it also offers sufficent detail to allow for labor market policy discussion in a given country...|$|R
40|$|PROJECT GOALS This project {{investigated}} {{the role of}} industrial relations in addressing precarious work. It focused on the initiatives and responses that trade unions and employers’ associations developed to deal with precarious work in Croatia, the Czech Republic (hereafter Czechia), Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia since 2008. In each country, the study analysed developments in five sectors, namely public healthcare, the metal industry, construction, retail and temporary agency work (TAW). The project used a qualitative approach to examine the dimensions of precarious employment, including low pay, irregular working hours, low job security and limited representation of workers’ rights. DUAL LABOUR MARKETS Apart from {{an increase in the}} share of non-standard work contracts since 2008, findings suggest that all forms of employment were exposed to more precarious conditions following various degrees of labour market deregulation across the 10 countries. In a context of weak law enforcement and decreasing unions’ role and influence, employers were able to use (and sometimes abuse) their enlarged prerogatives to increase the workload, the use of irregular working time and sometimes, to reduce the income of workers on all types of contracts. Still, workers in the informal market and dependent self-employed have the most precarious working conditions across the countries. These vulnerable groups are most prevalent in the construction and the retail sectors, often doing work for small domestic firms. In contrast, large (often multinational) firms, particularly in the construction and metal sectors use more frequently outsourcing to reduce labour costs. The share of agency workers, fixed-term and part-time employees has risen across the countries but less than expected in some countries (e. g. Croatia and Romania) due to labour shortages associated with massive emigration and the fact that employers have sufficient leverage to demand employees on full-time <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>contracts</b> to work irregular hours contingent on companies’ needs. RESPONSES OF SOCIAL PARTNERS TO PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT Social partners focused primarily on legal initiatives to regulate precarious work at the national level, while additional initiatives, such as collective bargaining were used at lower levels. Employers’ initiatives generally sought to deregulate the labour market and they have been quite successful, in most countries. Unions’ initiatives to improve precarious employment conditions through legislation often failed, which sometimes resulted in innovative or ‘recombined’ old and new strategies to fight against precarious work. In some countries, unions managed to organise the most vulnerable workers, such as self-employed and outsourced employees. Nevertheless, unions’ strategies varied across countries from aiming to transform precarious work arrangements into standard employment in Slovenia to supporting the economic rationale of precarious work forms in Latvia. POLICY IMPLICATIONS Periods of crisis throw new light {{on the role of the}} social partners. The labour market deregulation has shifted the initiative in industrial relations from unions and employers’ associations to individual employers by widening their prerogatives to set employment conditions, which in turn, increased the dualization of the labour markets. Furthermore, there is evidence of precarious work practices being exported by multinationals across their subsidiaries, prompting convergence of management practices. Trade unions need to be aware of the international dimension of precarious work, as they could also use their international networks, including their positions in European Works Councils, to fight against spreading precarious work by multinationals and a ‘race to the bottom’ in labour standards. Nevertheless, social partners cannot fight against precarious work, unless governments guarantee, at least, the fundamental union rights and ensure the effective implementation of labour law...|$|R

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} Temporary Help Agencies (THA) {{bring into}} the labor market a new fundamental feature. They are intermediaries on a market which is modeled as decentralized by the dominant theoretical framework, search theory. This theory explains the flows of hires by the individual search by workers and employers and ensuing matches. THA bring some centralization in this framework. If agents are moved by self interest, some should create such agencies, since they lower search costs through the benefits of specialization, and can earn profits. Introducing intermediaries is then a necessity to give the search model more coherent microfoundations. THA {{are not the only}} intermediaries in the real labor market. Many countries have a national placement agency paid by the tax payers. However THA do not only match, they are the legal employers of the workers, and the contract is therefore a particular contract, different from the standard Fixed Term Contracts (FTC). Then THA propose contracts which involve a mark up on wages, and which are competed by the standard FTC, implying search costs for the employing firm. The two types of contracts are substitutes and their coexistence is not obvious. Moreover temporary help jobs have important consequences for the labor market outcomes. THA select the workers for the client firm, and can gain precise information since they evaluate the same worker often for a new contract. Moreover it appears to be commun practice that they provide the worker with the training needed for the job in the client firm, since the short duration of the contract would make it too costly. A consequence is that temporary help workers, beyond being selected among condidates, gain human capital and also some experience on these jobs, three factors that may act as stepping stones for a future <b>Open</b> <b>Ended</b> <b>Contract</b> (OEC). However terminations rarely lead to an immediate OEC and short durations send most of the workers repeatedly into unemployment, delaying integration into OEC. Several major questions can then be tackled by the introduction of a THA in a model of the labor market. In this first paper on the topic, we will study three. First we will show that a calibrated model displays the coexistence of the two types of contracts, as well as the presence of OEC. Second we will study the efficiency that the temporary help contracts can bring to a labor market, notably in terms of unemployment and vacancies. Third we will analyse the consequences for the carreers of young workers. Are temporary help jobs a stepping stones or traps, and for whom ? In order to carry this analysis which is novel in the literature, we introduce a THA in WorkSim, a large Agent Based Model of the French labor market, with 10, 000 agents, which involves a scale of 1 / 4700. It is calibrated by the CMA-ES algorithm which sets 63 parameters to fit optimally 67 aggregated variables (measured for the year 2014). Goudet, Kant & Ballot, (2016) give a description of the first version of the model. The current version (Ballot, Kant & Goudet 2015) adds the endogenization of the choice between Fixed Term Contracts (FTC) and OEC, based on the total expected costs of each type of contract and anticipations by the firms on their own demand. We then give to the FTC a role of buffer. The decisions of the agents are based on search theory, albeit in a bounded rational context. This is justified on cognitive ground but also by the complexity of a labor market marked by the heterogeneity of our agents.
