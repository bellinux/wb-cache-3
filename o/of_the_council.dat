5|$|All {{proceedings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> {{are conducted}} in private, and the Council is prohibited from hearing objectors or examining witnesses regarding any bill or law under consideration. Since its establishment, the PCMR has not found any legislation to contain differentiating measures.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
