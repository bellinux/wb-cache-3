500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg. Dennis explained {{during an interview}} how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating [...] "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid {{so it looks like}} I actually do have a non-moving piece. <b>One</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed." [...] Dennis revealed in May 2011, that he wears a brace on his leg as remembering which leg to limp on was becoming a [...] "little distracting." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

[...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. <b>One</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened?

His earliest known recording success was in 1896 with [...] "In the World Turned Upside Down", followed by [...] "Down Fell the Pony in a Fit" [...] in 1897. In 1898 Champion ceased his style of alternating songs and patter and instead adopted a quick fire delivery in order for him to perform as many songs as he could during his act. He retained this style of delivery for the remainder of his career, remarking, [...] "At <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> used to sing songs with plenty of patter but I changed the style for a new idea of my own, and started [...] "quick singing".
