She would return to charges of cannibalism, and then turn to begging him for a single word of kindness. Twice, Madeleine attempted suicide after the courts found the Devil's Mark on her body.|$|R

Shortly after the series' debut, Fox News asked if the show {{therefore}} served as a campaign ad supporting Hillary Clinton, but quoted the Los Angeles Times saying the lead character was [...] "no Hillary knockoff" [...] and a New York publicist calling the casting of a woman [...] "simple business and smart on CBS' behalf". Conservative activist organization Culture and Media Institute, however, said the connection was clear, citing the women's blond hair and pantsuits.|$|R
40|$|Good {{intentions}} may be necessary, {{but they}} are not sufficient, to prevent genocide. Unfortunately, this renders the recent report of the Genocide Prevention Task Force, Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U. S. Policymakers (the Albright-Cohen Report), a recipe for failure. 1 The co-chairs, former US secretaries <b>of</b> <b>state</b> and defense <b>Madeleine</b> Albright and William Cohen, obviously have good intentions, and they do offer several constructive reforms. Overall, however, the report ignores the most profound lessons of past failures, declines to make the hard choices on policy dilemmas, and neglects to call for the costly military reforms that could enable intervention to prevent future genocides. A more realistic assessment of these challenges gives rise to a very different set of recommendations than that found in the report...|$|R
25|$|However, Mahathir's {{views were}} already firmly entrenched before this event. For example, before the ASEAN meeting in 1997, {{he made a}} speech condemning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, calling it an oppressive {{instrument}} by which the United States and other countries try to impose their values on Asians. He added that Asians need stability and economic growth more than civil liberties. These remarks did not endear him to US Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright, who was a guest at the meeting.|$|E

25|$|In October 1997, {{months after}} the Sudanese {{overture}} (made by Bashir in the letter to Hamilton), the U.S. State Department, under Sec. <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright's directive, first announced it would return US diplomats to Khartoum to pursue counterterrorism data in the Mukhabarat's possession, and then within days, reversed that decision and imposed harsher and more comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against the Sudan. In August 1998, {{in the wake of}} the East Africa embassy bombings, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against Khartoum. The last U.S. Ambassador to the Sudan, Ambassador Tim Carney, departed post prior to this event and no new ambassador has been designated since. The U.S. Embassy is headed by a charge d'affaires.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's {{personal}} account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. [...] A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries <b>of</b> <b>State</b> back to <b>Madeleine</b> Albright requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature. Datto, Inc., which provided data backup service for Clinton's email, agreed to give the FBI the hardware that stored the backups.|$|R

25|$|A {{few months}} later, during President Clinton's state visit to China, his wife Hillary and Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright visited the synagogue. Rabbi Schneier resanctified Ohel Rachel for the {{occasion}} using a Torah brought from New York City, which he then donated to the local Jewish community. In September 1999, a Rosh Hashanah service {{was held at the}} synagogue {{for the first time since}} 1952. The same year, the synagogue was separately visited by Israeli President Ezer Weizmann and by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The areas of the building refurbished for these visits were then used as a lecture hall, although Jews were permitted to observe holidays such as Purim, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah on site.|$|E
25|$|At Camp David, the Palestinians {{maintained}} their traditional {{demand that the}} right of return be implemented. They demanded that Israel recognize the right of all refugees who so wished to settle in Israel, but to address Israel's demographic concerns, they promised that the right of return would be implemented via a mechanism agreed upon by both sides, which would try to channel a majority of refugees away from the option of returning to Israel. According to U.S. Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright, some of the Palestinian negotiators were willing to privately discuss a limit {{on the number of}} refugees who would be allowed to return to Israel. Palestinians who chose to return to Israel would do so gradually, with Israel absorbing 150,000 refugees every year.|$|E

5000|$|Netanyahu {{opposed the}} Oslo accords from their inception. In 1993, he {{dedicated}} a chapter, entitled [...] "Trojan Horse", {{of his book}} A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini {{had been one of}} the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's 'alleged exterminationist Nazism.' During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor Oslo Accords," [...] "I said I would, but ... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue." ...|$|R

500|$|The largest {{event of}} Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's {{confrontation}} with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War.

This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak massacre. Then U.S. Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him [...] "there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." [...] Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they'd been [...] "handled" [...] in the 1940s by ethnic cleansing.|$|E
