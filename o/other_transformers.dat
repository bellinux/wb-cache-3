They {{are created by}} the Brotherhood of Makuta to conquer islands; they possess mutagenic venom and spin sticky green webs. In the Transformers franchise, Tarantulas and Blackarachnia are both Predacons that turn into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes <b>other</b> <b>Transformers</b> and she is capable of spinning webs.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{electrical}} transformers involved in the ship's propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted [...] "overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers". Inspection found that insulation failure had short-circuited the transformer, while <b>other</b> <b>transformers</b> aboard showed premature wear. Unable to find an available spare, a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that Choules would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the <b>other</b> <b>transformers</b> (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before Choules was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{account is}} given of a {{simulation}} model which {{takes the form}} of an equivalent circuit for a three-winding transformer with five-limb core and which {{can also be used to}} detect saturation phenomena occuring within the transformer. The method described permits the simulation of <b>other</b> <b>transformer</b> types, the only knowledge required being the geometrical dimensions, the winding structure and the magnetization characteristic. The accuracy of the model is proved by comparison of simulation results with a measured oscillogram of switch-off during inrush...|$|R
50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each <b>other.</b> <b>Transformer</b> action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor. As well, when close to operating speed, better motors lifted the brushes out of contact.|$|R

50|$|Solid state designs can be {{manufactured}} without output transformers {{and are therefore}} immune to speaker-dependent impedance mismatches and <b>other</b> <b>transformer</b> effects which alter the system spectral response. On the other hand, flat frequency response {{does not necessarily mean}} a good-sounding amplifier. The loudspeaker itself (regardless of price) will likely produce more non-linearity and uneven frequency response than any other part of the system. Typically, in sound reproduction systems, accurate reproduction of the sound of the original recording is the goal; distortion and uneven spectral response is to be avoided.|$|R

40|$|Many {{transformers}} may {{be connected}} in parallel to a distribution busbar to supply the load. Restoration of power supply after a black-out is carried out by switching on the transformers one by one, producing high inrush current at the instant of switching of each transformer. It is proposed that circuit breakers connected to all transformer secondaries should be closed first. Then, closing the primary side circuit breaker of the first transformer also energizes all remaining transformers from the secondary side. Inrush current in the first transformer with closed secondary circuit breakers of all transformers does not increase to a very high value. No inrush current is produced during subsequent switching of any <b>other</b> <b>transformer</b> from the primary side, as they are already energized from the secondary side...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of transformer supply in the two-dimensional (2 D) finite element (FE) simulation of rotating electrical machines.

The three models are used in the 2 D FE simulation of the steady-state load operation and the starting from stand-still of an induction motor. Peer reviewe...|$|R

When Sentinel Prime fell, exposing the Code Key of Justice within his chest, Starscream attempted to take the Key for himself but Blackout tried to stop him, taking a blow that would've killed any <b>other</b> <b>Transformer</b> but one that only managed to fell him. After Megatron subdued Starscream, Megatron asked for Blackout's name {{and told him he}} had a great future. He asked him to take Sentinel's body back to Kaon.

40|$|In {{a network}} using links with diverse properties, a packet flow that is fine tuned for some links (by {{selecting}} a proper packet size, transmission rate, encryption method, etc.) may be inappropriate for other links. Ability {{to change the}} flow properties over segments of the network allows flows with different characteristics to coexist; {{making it possible to}} adapt to diverse link properties. Application-specific adaptation mechanisms (such as proxies) do not force adaptations on every packet flowing over the link and are therefore insufficient for this purpose. We propose the concept of transformer tunnels that force adaptations on all the packets flowing through them. Transformer tunnels can coexist with proxies because the adaptations provided by both are independent of each <b>other.</b> <b>Transformer</b> tunnels provide adaptations by means of transformation functions. By attaching various transformation functions to such tunnels, we can efficiently fine tune the flow properties. We also provi [...] ...|$|R
