5|$|The News-Miner {{strongly}} supported the political campaign for statehood until 1959, when Alaska became the 49th {{state of the}} United States. On the day the U.S. Congress voted to have Alaska admitted as a state, Snedden arranged for a U.S. Air Force jet to fly copies of the News Miner, the Anchorage Times, and other Alaska newspapers to Washington, D.C. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the vote, each Congressman had an Alaska newspaper proclaiming statehood.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November Allenby made {{preparations}} for battle the following day. He ordered {{an attack by}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Turkish Army's right flank. Reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Turkish counterattack. This counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day, before fighting the Turkish Army to a standstill in front of Summeil. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the battle at Mughar Ridge, Junction Station was occupied and during the following days other villages in the area {{were found to have}} been abandoned. Later in the morning of 14 November New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran into a determined and well entrenched Turkish rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the Turkish 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon. Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the investigation, a woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose {{appearance}} and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> they were reported missing. Police also seized a white van from a caravan park in Wentworth, some 10 miles from Soham, on 7 August.|$|E

25|$|As {{explained}} below, {{the blessing}} is recited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the Sun completes its cycle; ideally, {{it should be}} recited at sunrise, referred to in Jewish law as haneitz hachammah. It is preferred to recite the blessing with a multitude of people, {{in keeping with the}} principle of b'rov am hadrat melech. The Magen Avraham and the Levush insist that it be recited within the first three hours after sunrise. The Mishnah Brurah, however, states on behalf of numerous Achronim that it is permitted the blessing to be recited until halachic noon.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the incident, Detective Henry Carmichael and Henry C. Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and {{detained}} him. Pack {{was one of}} {{two black}} officers on the city's approximately 45-man police force. Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at First and Main. Late that day, Police Commissioner J. M. Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland's life. He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail {{on the top floor of}} the Tulsa County Courthouse.|$|E
25|$|After daybreak on {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{servicemen}} returned to a small clearing near {{the eastern edge of the}} forest and found three small impressions in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m. the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions on the ground, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can't Tell the People, published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the first sighting.|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} {{in the size of}} the Army at the end of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War led to 8 RAR being amalgamated. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the Australian Labor Party won the 1972 Federal Election the battalion, like all others in the Army, was ordered to discharge all conscripts who did not wish to remain. This led to a large {{reduction in}} the size of the Army, and in 1973 it was decided to reduce the Royal Australian Regiment from nine to five battalions. This change was implemented by merging ('linking') several battalions, and on 31 October 8 RAR was linked with 9 RAR to form 8/9 RAR.|$|E
25|$|After a {{retirement}} of just under an hour, the jury {{returned with a}} verdict of guilty, which implicitly declared Straffen sane. Mr. Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to death. Straffen appealed, {{on the grounds that}} the evidence about the Bath murders was wrongly admitted, and that his statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the murder of Linda Bowyer were wrongly admitted because they had been made before he was cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed, and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. 4 September was fixed as the date for execution of judgment of death. However, on 29 August, it was announced that Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe had recommended to Queen Elizabeth II that Straffen be reprieved.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{payments}} are connected with marriage. Amobr, or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on {{the loss of}} her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. Cowyll, or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (agweddi) was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool. The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as argyvrau.|$|E

500|$|The papers did not publish {{news of the}} {{submarine}} attack until 2 June, {{as most of the}} attack occurred after the newspapers went to press on the morning of 1 June. Instead, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the attack, the front pages carried news of Operation Millennium, the Royal Air Force's first 1,000-bomber raid, although several newspapers included a small interior article mentioning the final reconnaissance flyover. The Federal Censor ordered total censorship of the events, issuing an official statement on the afternoon of 1 June which reported that the Allies had destroyed three submarines in Sydney Harbour, and described the loss of Kuttabul and the 21 deaths as the loss of [...] "one small harbour vessel of no military value". Smith's Weekly finally released the real story on 6 June, and follow-up material in the 13 June issue caused more political damage, prompting the Royal Australian Navy to attempt to charge the newspaper with releasing defence information.|$|E
500|$|The British were {{initially}} confused {{as to the}} cause of the sinking, suspecting either an on-board explosion or aerial attack. Once it was realised that a submarine attack was the most likely explanation, steps were rapidly made to seal the anchorage, but U-47 had already escaped and was on its way back to Germany. The BBC released news of the sinking by late morning on 14 October, and its broadcasts were received by the German listening services and by U-47 itself. Divers sent down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> the explosion discovered remnants of a German torpedo, confirming the means of attack. On 17 October First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill officially announced the loss of Royal Oak to the House of Commons, first conceding that the raid had been [...] "a remarkable exploit of professional skill and daring", but then declaring that the loss would not materially affect the naval balance of power. An Admiralty Board of Enquiry convened between 18 and 24 October to establish the circumstances under which the anchorage had been penetrated. In the meantime, the Home Fleet was ordered to remain at safer ports until security issues at Scapa could be addressed. Churchill was obliged to respond to questions in the House as to why Royal Oak had had aboard so many Boys, most of whom lost their lives. He defended the Royal Navy tradition of sending boys aged 15 to 17 to sea, but the practice was generally discontinued shortly after the disaster, and under 18-year-olds served on active warships in only the most exceptional circumstances.|$|E
