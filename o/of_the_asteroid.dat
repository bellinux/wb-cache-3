5|$|Among his discoveries was the {{asteroid}} 253 Mathilde, found on November 12, 1885. The initial orbital elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> were then computed by V. A. Lebeuf, another Austrian astronomer {{working at the}} Paris Observatory. The name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> was suggested by Lebeuf, after Mathilde, the wife of Moritz Loewywho was the vice director of the observatory in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another high-inclination {{group in}} the inner part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is the Phocaea family. These are {{composed}} primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
40|$|Echinoderms {{as a rule}} are pentamerous and {{therefore}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> have only five arms. However, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> like Luidia maculata, Acanthaster planci and others always have more than five arms. In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> like Pentaceraster regulus and Protoreaster lincki. <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> arms may be less than five or more than five due to freak formation at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> development...|$|R

5|$|Skirting {{the outer}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is the Cybele group, {{orbiting}} between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt {{makes for}} a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after the dwarf planet Ceres, and it contributes an estimated 9% of the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, the Japanese {{astronomer}} Kiyotsugu Hirayama {{noticed that}} <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> had similar parameters, forming families or groups.|$|R
50|$|Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid's</b> {{infrared}} spectrum shows an absorption feature {{that is similar}} to the one present in <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> 24 Themis. This can be explained by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> water ice. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> may be covered in a layer of fine silicate dust mixed with small amounts of water-ice and organic solids.|$|R

5|$|Carbon-rich asteroids are {{relatively}} preponderant {{in the outer}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt in our solar system.

The asteroids can be used in hypothetical space-based carbon mining, which may be possible in the future, but is currently technologically impossible.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is {{an asteroid}} in the asteroid belt. Juno {{was the third}} asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding. It is the 11th-largest asteroid, {{and one of the}} two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Juno is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger <b>asteroids,</b> perhaps tenth by {{size and}} {{containing}} approximately 1% <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>asteroid</b> belt. It is <b>the</b> second-most-massive S-type <b>asteroid</b> after 15 Eunomia. Even so, Juno has only 3% <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> Ceres.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>asteroids</b> within <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt have orbital eccentricities of {{less than}} 0.4, and an {{inclination}} {{of less than}} 30°. <b>The</b> orbital distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic, some <b>asteroid</b> orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.|$|R
40|$|We present lightcurves of {{selected}} <b>asteroids.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> were included to obtain refined spin periods. Enhanced periods were determined for 11 Parthenope, 306 Unitas and 372 Palma. We confirmed <b>the</b> spin periods <b>of</b> 8 Flora, 13 Egeria, 71 Niobe, 233 Asterope, 291 Alice, 409 Aspasia, 435 Ella and 512 Taurinensis. We determined also BV-colours for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> included <b>asteroids</b> and UBVRI-colours {{for a total}} of 22 asteroids...|$|R
5|$|The {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt {{varies with}} {{the distance from the}} Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.|$|E
5|$|The {{total mass}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is {{estimated}} to be 2.8×1021 to 3.2×1021 kilograms, which is just 4% of the mass of the Moon. The four largest objects, Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.|$|E
5|$|Transmission of many Ida images {{was delayed}} {{due to a}} {{permanent}} failure in the spacecraft's high-gain antenna. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a high-resolution mosaic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> at a resolution of 31–38m/pixel. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the spacecraft's proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{steady state}} distribution expected in <b>the</b> present day <b>asteroid</b> belt {{is important to}} our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collisional evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> and their physical properties. We have extended earlier work to show that, in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> gravity, a simple power law distribution {{as a function of}} mass with constant exponent will give an equilibrium distribution of asteroids for all bodies much smaller than <b>the</b> largest <b>asteroids.</b> This result holds for realistic fragmentation mechanisms and is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids.</b> Inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> gravity on disruption and fragmentation of asteroids precludes an analytic solution to this problem, and rules out a simple power law distribution. We are currently calculating numerical solutions {{in order to determine the}} expected steady state mass distribution in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt...|$|R
50|$|Before {{colonization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> {{became an}} attractive possibility, a main {{interest in them}} was theories as to their origin - specifically, the theory that <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> are remnants <b>of</b> an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot lines dealing with {{the possibility that the}} planet had been inhabited, and if so - that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from <b>the</b> past <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>asteroids</b> to <b>the</b> possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the grand}} tack, {{perturbations}} from the terrestrial planets and the Nice model instability alter <b>the</b> orbital distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>asteroids.</b> <b>The</b> resulting eccentricity and semi-major axis distributions resemble that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>asteroid</b> belt. Some low-inclination asteroids are removed, leaving the inclination distribution slightly over-excited compared to <b>the</b> current <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|R
5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra on the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new understanding {{about the relationship between}} S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, {{the most common type of}} meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The Galileo flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E

5|$|Leo {{intends to}} kill Quatermass {{to prevent the}} {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid,</b> and also to allow the ammonids to travel back to Earth en masse in the Quatermass II. He tries to kill Quatermass with a gun, but the recoil sends him floating helplessly off into space. Quatermass returns to the rocket and jettisons the nuclear motor, then flies the rocket back to earth as the motor blows up the asteroid, killing the remaining ammonids and relinquishing control over Dillon and all the 'marked' humans, returning mankind to its former freedom.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde {{was once}} a planet in the making before being {{involved}} in a collision with another object making it the asteroid that it is today. Speculations do range as {{it may have been}} the solar system's true 9th planet (other than Pluto), previously being an equal rival that of Ceres. This asteroid was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid,</b> revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited in 2010, was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as the central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, {{large parts of the}} surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E
