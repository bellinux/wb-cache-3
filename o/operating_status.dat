40|$|This paper {{considers}} feature {{discovery in}} fault diagnosis using bootstrap processing and genetic programming. Bootstrap {{is one of}} the powerful computer-simulated statistical techniques. It integrates classical statistics with the numerical calculations of a computer. This paper uses bootstrap to preprocess the operational data acquired from a running machine. Then, genetic programming evolves with the preprocessed data samples. The main aim is to discover an efficient tree-like structure {{on the basis of a}} group of simple initial candidate features. The best compound feature found by genetic programming can discriminate among the four kinds of commonly <b>operating</b> <b>statuses</b> of the machine. This novel approach is demonstrated by fault diagnosis of the fuel system in a diesel engine. Significance: The proposed feature discovery and analysis approach, which has been tested in a diesel engine fuel system, will significantly enhance the classification performance of fault diagnosis by combing bootstrap processing, genetic programming, and engineering knowledge...|$|R
