5|$|Primarily a grazer, the <b>oribi</b> prefers fresh {{grasses and}} browses occasionally. Grasses can {{constitute}} up to 90% of the diet; preferred varieties include Andropogon, Eulalia, Hyparrhenia, Loudetia, Pennisetum and Themeda species. Mineral licks are also visited regularly. <b>Oribi</b> {{have been observed}} feeding on flowers and Boletus mushrooms. Groups of <b>oribi</b> congregate in the rainy season, when grasses are abundant.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oribi</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) {{is estimated at}} 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is a relatively minor threat, since the <b>oribi</b> shows some tolerance to hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in <b>oribi</b> populations in Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) {{has been attributed to}} poaching. Numbers have also declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oribi</b> is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though some {{activity}} {{may also be}} observed at night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, <b>oribi</b> can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry; polygyny tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common.|$|E
50|$|The {{predominant}} wildlife {{species in}} Rungwa Game Reserve are: lions, leopards, Cape buffaloes, elands, sables, nibbles, Greater kudus, grysboks, klipspringers, <b>oribis,</b> hartebeests, liechtensteins, impala, zebras, hippopotami, crocodiles and bush pigs. The reserve provides the excellent habitation for lion and hyena. It is regarded to have largest concentration of bird species feeding themselves in Usangu valley.|$|R

50|$|Nkasa Rupara forms a {{corridor}} for all large mammal species moving between Namibia and Botswana, particularly African elephant and buffalo. There are about 1 000 buffalo in Nkasa Rupara, the largest concentration in Namibia. Around 560 hippopotami and 500 crocodile {{occur in the}} park’s rivers and channels. Rare antelope species include sitatungas, pukus, red lechwe, reedbucks and <b>oribis.</b> Mammals of this park as well as reptiles feature elephants, Katanga lions, Namibian cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyenas, Cape wild dogs, roan antelopes, impala, kudus, warthogs, baboons, spotted-necked otters, rock monitor lizards and water monitor lizards.|$|R
5|$|In a {{revision}} of the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} nuclear and mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues showed that the <b>oribi</b> is the sister taxon to all other antilopines. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oribi</b> {{occurs in}} a number of {{protected}} areas throughout its range, such as: Gashaka Gumti National Park in Nigeria, the Pendjari and W National Parks (Benin); Aouk Hunting Zone (Chad); Benoue, Bouba Njida and Faro National Parks (Cameroon); Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park (Central African Republic); Garamba, Upemba and Kundelungu National Parks (Congo-Kinshasa); Omo National Park (Ethiopia); Masai Mara Game Reserve and Ruma National Park (Kenya); Golden Gate Highlands National Park (South Africa); Serengeti National Park (Tanzania); Kidepo Valley, Lake Mburo and Murchison Falls National Parks (Uganda); Kafue and Liuwa Plain National Parks and Bangweulu Swamp (Zambia).|$|E
5|$|The tribe Neotragini {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of dwarf antelopes apart from Neotragus – these include Dorcatragus (beira), Ourebia (<b>oribi),</b> Madoqua (dik dik), Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. The tribe {{has been shown to}} be paraphyletic. A 2014 phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome b sequences and linear skull measurements showed polyphyly in Neotragus. The royal antelope is not closely related to the other two species in its genus – suni (N. moschatus) and Bates's pygmy antelope (N. batesi). The latter two are closely related, while the royal antelope is likely to have had an ancestor in common with the klipspringer and duikers (subfamily Cephalophinae).|$|E
40|$|Gastro-intestinal parasites of antelopes and buffalos (Syncerus caffer brachyceros) {{from the}} Nazinga game ranch in Burkina Faso. Parasitological survey {{done on the}} {{digestive}} tracts of antelopes [roans (Hippotragus equinus koba), hartebeests (Alcelaphus buselaphus major), defassa waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa), <b>oribis</b> (Ourebia ourebi quadriscopa) ] and buffalos (Syncerus caffer brachyceros) from the Nazinga game ranch in Burkina Faso allowed the identification of gastrointestinal parasites and the estimation of their prevalence and load. Nine different nematode species and three cestode species were found. Females and larvae of Cooperia were not identified up to the species level and were recognized as Cooperia spp. The nematode species found were: Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus axei, Cooperia curticei, Cooperia spatulata, Skrjabinema sp., Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichuris ovis, Bunostomum phlebotomum, and Oesophagostomum sp. Cestodes’ species were: Moniezia expansa, Avitellina centripunctata, and Stilesia globipunctata. It was also noted without a thorough investigation the presence of Setaria labiato-papillosa in the abdominal cavity and paramphistomes in the rumen. In spite {{of the presence of}} parasites on the antelopes and buffalos, their killing out percentages (47. 5 to 54. 7 %) indicated a good physical status...|$|R
50|$|Carnivores are {{exceptionally}} important prey for martial eagles. Among {{these many}} mongoose {{tend to be}} well represented in their diet. Most mongoose native to savanna tend to be highly social burrowers. Most {{of these types of}} mongoose are also relatively small (probably the second smallest important martial eagle food source after korhaans) and can effectively escape quickly to the safety of their underground home, so the lighter, more nimble male martial eagle is more likely to habitually pursue them. In southern Africa, the 0.72 kg meerkat (Suricata suricatta) comprises up to at least 9.6% of prey remains (as in the Cape Province) and the 0.75 kg Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta) comprising an average of 7.2% of prey remains in the Cape area. The largest of the social savanna-dwelling mongoose is the banded mongoose at 2.12 kg. Despite often being successful in capturing banded mongoose, in one case when a (presumably inexperienced) immature martial eagle took one to a tree, the dominant male banded mongoose of the group scaled the tree and pulled away from the eagle the still-living mongoose prey to safety. The martial eagle is a known predator of the full size range of mongoose species, from the smallest species, the 0.27 kg common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), to the largest, the 3.38 kg white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda). Other moderate-sized carnivores known to fall prey to martial eagles include 0.83 kg striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus) and a few species of genet, which are about twice as heavy on average as the polecat. The martial eagle, however, can be a surprisingly effective predator of carnivorans close to their own size or larger. In the Cape Province, 72 bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), which average about 4.1 kg, were found in the prey remains, 85% of which were adults. Other foxes have also been hunted, as well as both black-backed (Canis mesomelas) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). Some of the black-backed jackals that martial eagles have captured and flown off with have included “half-grown” individuals and a rare adult, averaging some 8.9 kg, may also be killed but is usually grounded prey. Despite being marginally the smallest of the 3 jackals, the black-backed is the most aggressive and predatory species, so are probably taken only in surprise blitzes. Adult domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of up to a modest size may occasionally be killed by martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to opportunistically grab pups of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) as they emerge from their dens. A similarly impressive range of felids have been included in their prey spectrum. Adults of both domestic cats and their ancestors, the 4.65 kg African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), are known to fall prey to this species. Arguably their most impressive mammalian carnivore prey though are adults of much larger cat species such as the 10.1 kg serval (Leptailurus serval) and even the 12.7 kg caracal (Caracal caracal). Apparent predatory attacks are even attempted on big cat cubs as they are considered potential predators of lion and leopard (Panthera pardus) cubs and confirmed predators of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs. Evidence shows, however, they rapidly abandon hunting attempts if the formidable mother lion or leopard are present. Successful predatory attacks on other relatively large carnivores have included adults of the 12.4 kg African civet (Civettictis civetta) and the 8.16 kg aardwolf (Proteles cristata).While large accipitrids from around the world are credited with attacks on (almost always young) ungulates, perhaps no other species is as accomplished in this regard as this martial eagle. Over 30 species of ungulate have been identified as prey for this species, more species than are attributed to the perhaps more powerful crowned eagles and all the world’s golden eagles, although in all 3 seldom more than 30% of the diet are comprised by ungulates in a given region. In Kruger National Park, the martial eagle is mentioned as the only bird considered as a major predator of ungulate species. A majority of the ungulate diet of martial eagles are comprised by small antelope species or the young of larger antelopes. Locally favored prey are the dik-diks, one of the smallest kind of antelope, and every known species may be vulnerable to this eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were the second most numerous prey species and it was estimated that at least 86 dik-diks are taken in the park {{over the course of the}} year by two pairs of martial eagles. At an average of 5 kg, these can provide a very fulfilling meal for an eagle family. Adults of other smaller antelope such as 4.95 kg suni (Neotragus moschatus) and 4.93 kg blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) are probably also taken with relative ease. In general, the young of other antelope are usually attacked, including newborns. Occasional ambush attacks or successful predations are reported on adults of much larger species despite young ones being rather more vulnerable, including 12.1 kg klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus), 11.1 kg steenboks (Raphicerus campestris), both species of grysbok (7.6 to 10.6 kg on average), 14.6 kg <b>oribis</b> (Ourebia ourebi) and perhaps up to half a dozen larger duikers, potentially weighing from 7.7 to 25 kg. One duiker dispatched via strangulation weighed an estimated 37 kg, the largest known raptorial kill for any species on the African continent. Among extant birds of prey, only wedge-tailed eagles, reportedly capable of killing sheep and female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) weighing up to 50 kg, and golden eagles, credited with taking adult female deer of several species with weights estimated at 50 to 70 kg and capable of apparently dispatching domestic calves weighing up to 114 kg, have larger kills attributed to them. Calves, including neonatal young, of the following antelope may also be included in their prey spectrum: impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus), common tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), Eudorcas gazelles, gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), kob (Kobus kob) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca arundinum). These species can vary in weight from 2.6 kg (i.e. gazelles) to 11 kg (i.e. tsessebe) in newborns. For the newborn impala, weighing already 5.55 kg, the martial eagle is the only bird considered to be a significant predator. Additionally, piglets of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) (of which only the martial eagle among accipitrids is similarly mentioned as a significant predator) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are taken.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The <b>oribi</b> lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, <b>oribi,</b> and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
25|$|The antilopine bovids (dwarf antelope, {{such as the}} springbok, blackbuck, gazelles, dik-diks, <b>oribi,</b> {{and several}} similar species) have {{well-developed}} preorbital glands.|$|E
25|$|Somalia {{contains}} {{a variety of}} mammals due to its geographical and climatic diversity. Wild fauna are found throughout the territory, including the cheetah, lion, reticulated giraffe, baboon, civet, serval, elephant, bushpig, gazelle, ibex, kudu, dik-dik, <b>oribi,</b> Somali wild ass, reedbuck and zebra, shrew, rock hyrax, golden mole and antelope. It also has a large population of the dromedary camel.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest were}} {{scattered}} and proceeding independently, including {{a group of}} four with Pink, trailing some 80 miles behind the main body. The 1st Support Group sailed from Newfoundland at midday with frigates Wear, Jed, Spey and sloops Pelican and Sennen to replace <b>Oribi</b> and Offa whose fuel state would become critical on the 5th. U-628 of group Finke, assembled to catch convoy SC 128, sighted convoy ONS 5 at 2018. Two of the gathering group Finke U-boats were attacked by RCAF Cansos in separate incidents. One {{thought to have been}} U-630 was sunk; but is now believed to have been U-209, which was damaged in an attack by Canso W, and foundered later while attempting to return to base. The other, U-438, was only slightly damaged in attacks by Canso E.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 25,000 large animals, mostly ungulates, {{live in the}} crater. Large {{animals in}} the crater include the black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis), the local population of which declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, the African buffalo or Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). There also are many other ungulates: the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) (7,000 estimated in 1994), Grant's zebra (Equus quagga boehmi) (4,000), the common eland (Taurotragus oryx), and Grant's (Nanger granti) and Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) (3,000). Waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) occur mainly near Lerai Forest. There are no topis (Damaliscus lunatus), oribis (Ourebia <b>oribi),</b> or crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). Impala (Aepyceros melampus) are absent because the open woodland they prefer does not exist. Giraffe also are absent, possibly {{because of a lack}} of browse species. Tanzanian cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus raineyi), East African wild dog (Lycaon pictus lupinus), and African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) are rarely seen.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>oribi</b> is Ourebia ourebi. The sole member of its genus, the <b>oribi</b> is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782. The <b>oribi</b> was formerly included in the tribe Neotragini, that comprised {{a variety of other}} dwarf antelopes, including Dorcatragus (beira), Madoqua (dik dik), Neotragus, Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. In 1963, German mammalogist Theodor Haltenorth separated the <b>oribi</b> and Raphicerus into a new tribe, Raphicerini; later on, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon assigned the <b>oribi</b> to Ourebini, a tribe of its own. The common name [...] "oribi" [...] (...) comes from the Afrikaans name for the animal, oorbietjie.|$|E

500|$|The <b>oribi</b> {{occurs in}} a variety of {{habitats}} – from savannahs, floodplains and tropical grasslands with [...] tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes, up to [...] above the sea level. This antelope is highly sporadic in distribution, ranging from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and southward to Angola and the Eastern Cape (South Africa). The <b>oribi</b> has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN; numbers have declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock.|$|E
500|$|The <b>oribi</b> {{occurs in}} a variety of {{habitats}} – from savannahs, floodplains and tropical grasslands with [...] tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes, up to [...] above the sea level. Recently burnt areas often attract groups of <b>oribi.</b> The choice of habitat depends on the availability of cover needed to escape the eyes of predators. Population densities typically vary between 2 and 10 individuals per km2; however, densities as high as 45 individuals per km2 have been recorded in tropical grasslands that receive over [...] of annual rainfall and open floodplains. The oribi's range overlaps with those of larger grazers such as the African buffalo, hippopotamus, hartebeest, Thomson's gazelle and topi. These separate species often occur in close proximity to each other, increasing predator vigilance.|$|E
500|$|Males {{defend their}} group's territory, [...] large; female members may also show some {{aggression}} and drive away intruders. A {{study showed that}} the number of females that visit the male's territory depends on the appearance (particularly the symmetry) of the male's horns. Males mark vegetation and soil in their territories by preorbital gland secretions and excrement; the intensity of marking increases with the number of male neighbours. Dominant males tend to have greater access to females in and around the territory than other males. An important feature of the social behaviour of <b>oribi</b> is the [...] "dung ceremony", in which all animals form temporary dung middens. <b>Oribi</b> at least three months old have been observed giving out one to three alarm whistles on sensing danger. These whistles are more common in adults than in juveniles, and males appear to whistle more. Common predators include carnivorans such as jackals.|$|E
500|$|Only males possess horns; the thin, {{straight}} horns, [...] long, are smooth at {{the tips}} and ringed at the base. The maximum horn length, , {{was recorded in}} 1998 from Malawi. The <b>oribi</b> has at least six different, well-developed scent glands (such as the prominent preorbital glands near the eyes). The body has several modifications, such as the large fossae below the eyes, to accommodate such {{a large number of}} glands. Females have four teats.|$|E
500|$|The <b>oribi</b> is a small, slender antelope; {{it reaches}} nearly [...] at the {{shoulder}} and weighs [...] The head-and-body length is typically between [...] Sexually dimorphic, males are slightly smaller than females (except for O. o. ourebi, in which females are smaller). This antelope features a slightly raised back, and long neck and limbs. The glossy, yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin, throat, underparts and rump. The bushy tail, brown to black on the outside, has white insides (except in O. o. hastata, that has a completely black tail). The subspecies show some variation in colouration; O. o. ourebi is a rich rufous, while O. o. hastata is yellower.|$|E
500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, <b>oribi,</b> roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the prey population.|$|E

Euryalus fell in astern of the port column of merchant ships while Sheffield and Hermione joined the starboard column as the remaining destroyers closed into a night steaming formation. The night steaming formation was attacked by a few torpedo bombers, and Imperial Star {{was struck by a}} single torpedo. <b>Oribi</b> took the damaged freighter in tow. Italian Motoscafo armato silurante (MAS torpedo boats) deployed through the Strait of Messina, but failed to find the convoy.|$|E

They visited Red Lake, Blue Cañon, Keams Cañon, <b>Oribi,</b> the Moki villages, Tuba, Moencopie, and Moen Ave. This trip took many weeks and gave Shefford all the opportunity he wanted to study the Indians, and the conditions nearer to the border of civilization. He learned the truth about the Indians and the missionaries.|$|E
6000|$|Afar in {{the desert}} I love to ride, [...] With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side: [...] Away, away, from the {{dwelling}} of men [...] By the wild-deer's haunt, by the buffalo's glen: [...] By valleys remote where the <b>oribi</b> plays, [...] Where the gnu, the gazelle and the hartebeest graze, [...] And the kudu and eland unhunted recline [...] By the skirts of grey forests o'erhung with wild vine, [...] Where the elephant browses at peace in his wood, [...] And the river-horse gambols unscared in the flood, [...] And the mighty rhinoceros wallows at will [...] In the fen where the wild ass is drinking his fill.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{after much}} hard and steady climbing, {{we reached the}} top and stood upon a {{perfectly}} level space ten or twelve acres in extent, exactly in the centre of which was placed the chief's kraal. Before we dismounted we rode to the extreme {{western edge of the}} plateau, to {{look at one of the}} most perfectly lovely views it is possible to imagine. It was like coming face to face with great primeval Nature, not Nature as we civilised people know her, smiling in corn-fields, waving in well-ordered woods, but Nature as she was on the morrow of the Creation. There, to our left, cold and grey and grand, rose the great peak, flinging its dark shadow far beyond its base. Two thousand feet and more beneath us lay the valley of the Mooi river, with the broad tranquil stream flashing silver through its midst. Over against us rose another range of towering hills, with sudden openings in their blue depths through which could be seen the splendid distances of a champaign country. Immediately at our feet, and seeming to girdle the great gaunt peak, lay a deep valley, through which the Little Bushman's River forced its shining way. All around rose the great bush-clad hills, so green, so bright in the glorious streaming sunlight, and yet so awfully devoid of life, so solemnly silent. It was indeed a sight never to be forgotten, this wide panoramic out-look, with its towering hills, its smiling valleys, its flashing streams, its all-pervading sunlight, and its deep sad silence. But it was not always so lifeless and so still. Some few years ago those hills, those plains, those rivers were teeming each with their various creatures. But a short time since, and standing here at eventide, the traveller could have seen herds of elephants cooling themselves yonder after their day's travel, whilst the black-headed white-tusked sea-cow rose and plunged in the pool below. That bush-clad hill was the favourite haunt of droves of buffaloes and elands, and on that plain swarmed thousands upon thousands of springbok and of quagga, of hartebeest and of <b>oribi.</b> All alien life must cease before the white man, and so these wild denizens of forest, stream, and plain have passed away never to return.|$|E
