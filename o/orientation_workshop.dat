The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine reflective journals to identify students’ experiences and perceived learning during a 12 -week placement programme in residential aged care facilities (RACF) on the NSW Central Coast, Australia. Methodology: All final year dental hygiene students from the University of Newcastle, Australia attended an aged care <b>orientation</b> <b>workshop</b> prior to commencing the RACF student placement programme. Throughout the placement, students were asked to record their educational experiences in reflective journals. Student reflections were based on the ‘Gibbs Reflective Cycle’, diarising experiences and feelings. Qualitative data was analysed using the constant comparative method and unitised to identify emergent themes. Results: Sixty-seven students completed reflective journals during the placement programme; emergent themes indicated students felt ill-prepared for the placement programme despite attending the <b>orientation</b> <b>workshop.</b> They were apprehensive and nervous prior to commencement of the placement. The general consensus after week 6 was that the placement became a more positive experience where students began to feel comfortable in the RACF environment and residents, and staff started to respond more positively to their presence. Overall, they thought the placement was challenging and confronting, but had improved their skills and knowledge in care of older people and increased their confidence in working with other healthcare professionals. Conclusion: The reflective journals provided students with the opportunity to record and reflect on their experience and perceived learning during the placement programme. Student reflections identified negative experiences at the commencement of the placement, suggesting a need for additional orientation prior to the RACF programme...|$|E

The aim of the current research {{was to determine whether}} a leadership initiative such as a leadership <b>orientation</b> <b>workshop</b> had a positive influence on the engagement of engineers at a gold mining plant in South Africa. A qualitative research method was utilized by conducting group interviews with engineers. Six focus group interviews with engineers from the plant were conducted. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. The narrative data was broken down into smaller units, coded and named according to the content represented. The recurring themes were then categorized and described. Categories such as bottom-up leadership, transformational leadership, charismatic leadership, authentic leadership, change leadership, mind-set training, values, strategic alignment, two-way feedback, recognition, trust, diversity, safety, relationships, job profiles, performance management and career development were identified. The charismatic leadership style of the plant manager and his commitment to engaging the engineers were strong themes throughout the research. The importance of enabling managers to become leaders was also clear. The overall perceptions were that the leadership workshop initiated employee engagement amongst the engineers.

40|$|In recent years, a {{large and}} rapidly growing body of {{academic}} research has involved multidisciplinary collaboration. This trend {{has been driven by}} a dramatic rise in funding for multidisciplinary projects and research centers, along with a growing recognition that few truly important unsolved research problems involve only one discipline and faculty members cannot hope to become experts in everything. When planning a week-long <b>orientation</b> <b>workshop</b> for new engineering and science faculty at North Carolina State University, we felt a responsibility to acquaint the participants with this reality of academic research and to help prepare them to engage in collaborative efforts that go well beyond their familiar academic turf. To this end we organized the workshop participants into bi-disciplinary pairs and gave them about 90 minutes to formulate a research project involving each of their areas of expertise. Most of their project outlines (including some from the most unlikely pairings) were coherent, feasible, exciting, and in the opinion of the workshop leaders, likely to be fundable if they were followed through to completion. Some of the pairs have in fact continued their conversations and several proposals are expected to emerge...|$|E

This study investigated the impact that a structured peer tutoring program had on improving the mathematics and reading achievement scores of academically disadvantaged, handicapped, and limited-English proficient students enrolled in vocational classes in two Chicago Public High Schools. Second, the study analyzed the effect that the program had on the tutors based on their mathematics and reading achievement scores. Finally, the study assessed selected administrative procedures used to implement this program. Significant differences demonstrated by higher scores were found for academically disadvantaged and handicapped students who were tutored in the area of reading achievement. Also, the limited-English proficient students who were not tutored demonstrated significant improvement in mathematics. Further, significant differences demonstrated by higher scores were found in mathematics for students who provided tutoring services and for students who did not provide tutoring services in reading.

On the other hand, 2 D polygons and polygonal models are still the industrial standard. However, extraction of the 2 D polygons from MVS point clouds is still a non-trivial task, {{given the fact that}} the boundaries of the detected planes are zigzagged and regularities, such as parallel and orthogonal, cannot preserve. Aiming to solve these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical polygon regularization method for the photogrammetric point clouds from existing MVS pipelines, which comprises of local and global levels. After boundary points extraction, e. g. using alpha shapes, the local level is used to consolidate the original points, by refining the orientation and position of the points using linear priors. The points are then grouped into local segments by forward searching. In the global level, regularities are enforced through a labeling process, which encourage the segments share the same label and the same label represents segments are parallel or orthogonal. This is formulated as Markov Random Field and solved efficiently. Preliminary results are made with point clouds from aerial oblique images and compared with two classical regularization methods, which have revealed that the proposed method are more powerful in abstracting a single building and is promising for further 3 D polygonal model reconstruction and GIS applications.

Therefore, the Islamia University of Bahawalpur –a formal mode university took an innovative initiative to become a dual mode university by establishing an Institute of Distance Education (IDE) in 2011. The institute offered along with others, an M. Phill programme in ten disciplines through distance education mode in semester fall 2011. More than eight hundred applications were received by potential learners against 275 seats. However, after test and interview 189 students were enrolled in M. Phill programme in Applied Psychology, Arabic, Education, English, Media Studies, Islamic Studies, Pakistan Studies, History, Persian, and Urdu. In the beginning, the Institute organized an <b>orientation</b> <b>workshop</b> for learners to guide them studying in distance education system. The programme was offered under semester system and the semester was broke up into two halves –mid-term and final term. The respective departments provided learning materials to students whereas the IDE provided instructional booklet. Submission of two assignments was compulsory for the entire semester; one before mid-term and second before final-term workshop/ examination for each of the courses. Similarly, students’ presence in workshops for 24 hours (12 during mid-term and 12 during final-term workshop) for one 3 -credit hour course was mandatory.

A {{review of}} {{literature}} demonstrated the national significance of John Muir???s accomplishments to the conservation movement in the United State {{as well as the}} significance of the home site and ranch. Student field trips to the John Muir National Historic Site were conducted by focusing on a Victorian Home tour where John Muir lived and worked. The National Park Service (NPS) believed home tours overlooked key opportunities to tell the larger story of John Muir???s values and accomplishments, use the natural and cultural resources of the ranch, and demonstrate the relevance of both John Muir and the historic site to the needs of contemporary students. Local area teachers advised the historic site interpretive staff of their interest in bringing classes on multiple field trips during the school year if the staff expanded the range of activities and experiences available at the site. This project examined John Muir???s life, his connection to the Strentzel-Muir Ranch and the natural and cultural resources of the site itself. A field trip curriculum guide is provided as the primary tool to expand existing thematic interpretation and education opportunities on the site. Information was gathered through a {{review of literature}} on the following topics: 1) significance of the site and its development as a national park; 2) how activities that occurred at the Strentzel-Muir Ranch helped to define and illustrate early California agricultural history and urbanization of the Alhambra Valley.
