25|$|Catherine de Forcade from Orthez, who, {{forced to}} convert to Catholicism, refused to receive the Sacraments of the Catholic Church and to perform Catholic rituals before dying in March 1688, was {{condemned}} to have her properties confiscated, her cadaver dragged {{through the streets of}} Orthez <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> and then left on the road instead of being buried.|$|E
25|$|The line {{uses the}} Abt rack system devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. The system comprises {{a length of}} toothed rail (the rack) between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the pinion) mounted on each rail vehicle's driving axle. The traditional logo for the railway is a pinion ring engaged <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> bar. At the stations and passing loops, the real items are mounted on steel frames.|$|E
25|$|The {{hands and}} facial {{features}} of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes. A mime from Switzerland was hired to help choreograph {{the movements of the}} puppeteers.|$|E

25|$|Two night fighter sub-variants of the F6F-3 were developed: the 18 F6F-3E's were {{converted}} from standard-3s and featured the AN/APS-4 radar in a pod mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> beneath the right wing, {{with a small}} radar-scope fitted {{in the middle of}} the main instrument panel and radar operating controls installed on the port side of the cockpit. The later F6F-3N, first flown in July 1943, was fitted with the AN/APS-6 radar in the fuselage, with the antenna dish in a bulbous fairing mounted on the leading-edge of the outer right wing; approximately 200 F6F-3Ns were built. Hellcat night fighters claimed their first victories in November 1943. A total of 4,402 F6F-3s were built through until April 1944, when production was changed to the F6F-5.|$|E
2500|$|Before the game, {{every player}} was {{required}} to place a wager. [...] Items such as handkerchiefs, knives, trinkets and horses {{were part of the}} wager.

The plastic sheets are about 4inches apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.|$|E

2500|$|One design {{common in}} early days, called a [...] "loose coupler", {{consisted}} of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil. The smaller coil was mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> {{so it could be}} slid linearly in or out of the larger coil. If radio interference was encountered, the smaller coil would be slid further out of the larger, loosening the coupling, narrowing the bandwidth, and thereby rejecting the interfering signal.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern congas have a staved wooden or {{fiberglass}} shell, and a screw-tensioned drumhead. They {{are usually}} played in sets {{of two to}} four with the fingers and palms of the hand. Typical congas stand approximately [...] {{from the bottom of}} the shell to the head. The drums may be played while seated. Alternatively, the drums may be mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> or stand to permit the player to play while standing. While they originated in Cuba, their incorporation into the popular and folk music of other countries has resulted in diversification of terminology for the instruments and the players. In Cuba, congas are called tumbadoras.|$|E
2500|$|All Gibson P-90 pickups (vintage and otherwise) were machine {{wound on}} Leesona coil winding machines, {{although}} their electrical specifications may vary slightly due to operator error. In common {{with many other}} modern pickup types, there are two versions of modern P-90: neck and bridge version. Their DC resistance tends to be around 7-8 kΩ for neck pickups and 8-9 kΩ for bridge pickups. Early P-90 pickups made before approx. 1974 were manufactured with {{no difference in the}} bridge and neck position and were interchangeable. After winding, pickups were hung <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> holding 20 pickups and assembled according to the model of guitar they were to be used on (Soap-Bar or Dog Ear). [...] Earlier pickups (around 1952) had Alnico 3 magnets, but in 1957 Gibson switched to Alnico 5.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the next}} ten years, Nick became {{associated}} with Megadeth's [...] "classic" [...] period and also his Greg Voelker Rack System. This included a double-bass drum kit with the tom-toms mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lower chrome <b>rack</b> and all cymbal crashes mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>rack,</b> which was supported by two chrome bars behind the drummer. This was later adopted by Megadeth on 2004's Blackmail the Universe tour, which featured <b>a</b> similar <b>rack</b> system.|$|R

2500|$|The US Army Bombe was {{physically}} {{very different from}} the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It was known as [...] "003" [...] or [...] "Madame X". It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> approximately [...] long [...] high and [...] wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.|$|E

60|$|By {{the light}} of a candle he {{examined}} the room. A bed, with the covers neatly turned back, revealed snowy pillows and sheets. A worn, but clean, red carpet covered the floor. There was a dresser with a beveled mirror, a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher; the two or three chairs were softly upholstered. A little table held books, papers, and a day-old cluster of roses in a jar. There were towels <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> and soap in a white dish.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a small}} room, dimly lighted {{and very}} disorderly. Scraps of paper were strewn around the floor. Dust had settled on the ink-rollers of the foot-press. A single case of type stood <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> and {{the form of a}} bill-of-fare--partly [...] "pied"--was on a marble slab which formed the top of a small table. On an upturned soap-box was a pile of {{unprinted}} menu cards. Josie noted a few cans of ink, a bottle of benzine, and a few printing tools lying carelessly about, but the room contained nothing more.|$|E

Rollo thought it criminal negligence to leave such weapons of precision lying about. He was given a choice of evils, and chose the dog-whip; the next minute or so he spent in wondering how he could have made such a stupid selection. Then they went back to the languidly expectant females.|$|E
