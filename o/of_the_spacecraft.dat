5|$|While {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{in which}} the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than {{the construction of the}} OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, CryoSat-2 was {{constructed}} by EADS Astrium, with its main instrument being built by Thales Alenia Space. Construction {{and testing of}} the spacecraft's primary instrument was completed by February 2008, when it was shipped for integration with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> In August 2009, the spacecraft's ground infrastructure, which had been redesigned since the original mission, was declared ready for use. Construction and testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> had been completed by mid-September. The Project Manager for the CryoSat-2 mission was Richard Francis, {{who had been the}} Systems Manager on the original CryoSat mission.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> Cargo would have been transferred through the nose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It {{would have had a}} higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} on <b>the</b> optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trajectories and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecrafts</b> with electric rocket plants are investigated. The new numerical methods for optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trajectories for <b>the</b> <b>spacecrafts</b> with propulsion systems of small traction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuation method type, characterizing with the widened convergence field have been constructed. <b>The</b> practical-regular method <b>of</b> trajectory optimization {{has been developed}} for case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal-regulated propulsion system. The evolution in <b>the</b> spiral motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecrafts</b> with small traction engines in <b>the</b> gravitation field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celestial bodies has been investigated.

5|$|According to Russian sources, the {{official}} decision to launch Sputnik 2 {{was made on}} 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik 2, therefore, {{was something of a}} rush job, with most elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} most urgent problem, however, was in finding funds {{to support the}} {{continued}} operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia. The French space agency, having already {{contributed significantly to the}} project (both scientifically and financially), took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly.|$|E
5|$|The orbiter {{continued}} to experience recurring problems in 2009, including four spontaneous resets, {{culminating in a}} four-month shut-down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> from August to December. While engineers have not determined {{the cause of the}} recurrent resets, they have created new software to help troubleshoot the problem should it recur.|$|E
50|$|A novel feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> reentry module was <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{a natural}} material, {{impregnated}} oak, as the ablative material for its heat shield.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Progress <b>spacecraft</b> made {{it safely}} to orbit and {{deployed}} its solar arrays as planned. However one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> Kurs antennae, used for approach and docking, failed to deploy at the scheduled time.|$|R
50|$|On 7 June 2015 at 12:53:17 UTC, {{telemetry}} {{indicated a}} failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), causing loss of onboard power regulation and attitude stabilization.

5|$|Workers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver {{assembled}} the spacecraft structure and attached the instruments. Instruments were constructed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, the Italian Space Agency in Rome, and Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego. The total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was $720million USD.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
50|$|As the anomaly was growing, it {{appeared}} that <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> were moving more slowly than expected. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> speed using <b>the</b> Doppler effect demonstrated the same thing: the observed redshift was less than expected, which meant that the Pioneers had slowed down more than expected.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bolo is {{to either}} speed up, or slow down, a {{spacecraft}} that docks with it without using any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> onboard propellant {{and to change}} <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> orbital flight path. Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.|$|R
50|$|The Beagle 2 fate {{remained}} a mystery until January 2015 {{when it was}} located intact on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> Mars {{in a series of}} images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE camera. The images suggest that two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> communications antenna.|$|R
5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E
5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{planning}} <b>of</b> a {{joint mission}} involving <b>the</b> two Helios <b>spacecraft</b> and <b>the</b> two Voyager <b>spacecraft</b> is reported. During late fall 1977 <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>spacecraft</b> facilitated correlation measurements {{as part of}} an investigation of interplanetary space in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> and their orbits are described, and the benefits that could result from future joint missions are considered...|$|R
50|$|While {{working on}} the Atlantis orbiter, NASA {{technicians}} discovered that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> radiator panels showed evidence of micrometeorite damage. A hole was observed which {{was reported to be}} about 2.7 mm (0.108 in) in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Aerojet, under license with Busek, {{manufactured}} a 4 kW Hall thruster (the BPT-4000) {{which was}} flown aboard the USAF AEHF communications <b>spacecraft.</b> <b>The</b> thruster {{is credited with}} saving the first satellite by raising it to geosynchronous orbit after failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> main apogee engine.|$|R
5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while {{moving at}} a velocity of 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft).</b> However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|Surprised by the {{underperformance}} of Thunderbirds Are Go {{and convinced}} that the franchise still had cinematic potential, United Artists authorised {{the production of a}} sequel. However, Thunderbird 6 received a similarly unenthusiastic response on its release in 1968, and the Thunderbirds franchise was abandoned until the appearance of a reboot, starring live actors, in 2004. Meanwhile, the Zero-X astronauts were featured in their own strip in the Anderson-related TV Century 21 comic until 1969, and the MEV portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> appeared in the pilot episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
5000|$|On January 16, 2009 Astra 5A [...] "experienced a {{technical}} anomaly leading to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> mission". All traffic ceased, {{with much of}} it (especially channels for German cable service, Kabel Deutschland) transferred to Astra 23.5°E.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the instrument's {{variable}} resistor and cam-activated electric blade contacts modulated electrical signals from other electrical instruments through <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> and its control systems, feeding {{them with an}} analog representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> displacement relative to Earth coordinates. From a systems design perspective, it is remarkable, even in the early 1960s, that a mechanical system generated crucial, primary data to electrical and electronic control and telemetry systems through <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 7 the {{gas supply}} in the {{attitude}} control system was exhausted, and between December 10 and 11, a total of 83 micrometeoroid hits were recorded which caused perturbation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> attitude and degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal strength. On December 21, 1967, communications with Mariner 4 were terminated. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> is now derelict in an exterior heliocentric orbit.|$|R
5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> which required rescuing.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> over six orbits, {{as well as}} the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
50|$|Players {{control a}} {{spacecraft}} of their choice, battling hundreds of alien ships. Various power-ups, numerous {{in the first}} level but increasingly rare afterwards, permit an exponential increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> seven different weapons (Guns, Buildup, Side shots, Homing missiles, Plasma, Magma, Laserbeam).|$|R
50|$|Weightlessness in an {{orbiting}} spacecraft {{is physically}} identical to free-fall, with the difference that gravitational acceleration causes a net {{change in the}} direction, rather than <b>the</b> magnitude, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> velocity. This is because the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector.|$|R
25|$|The lander's fate {{remained}} a mystery {{until it was}} located intact on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> Mars in a series <b>of</b> images from <b>the</b> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
