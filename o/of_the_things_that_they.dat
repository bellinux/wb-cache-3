25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are doing.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the second}} season premiere aired in September 2009, co-creator J.R. Orci hinted that the {{audience}} was going to meet [...] "many Observers", {{and that in the}} season's eighth episode, [...] "You're going to find out their role in the world, what they're named after, and their connection to some of these characters." [...] Later on, when still leading up to the airing of [...] "August" [...] in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that [...] "Individuality will be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be fanatically struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a year. You finally get to open the toy box and really play with those toys". Actor Michael Cerveris, who plays September, commented in an interview {{that as a result of}} the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers [...] "are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that [...] "it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once".|$|E

[...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used to know. She couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was so personal, it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every time I tried to sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E

60|$|The droll lightheartedness {{which won}} Comus Bassington such measure of {{popularity}} as he enjoyed among his fellows did not materially help to endear {{him to the}} succession of masters with whom he came in contact {{during the course of}} his schooldays. He amused and interested such of them as had the saving grace of humour at their disposal, but if they sighed when he passed from their immediate responsibility it was a sigh of relief rather than of regret. The more enlightened and experienced of them realised that he was something outside the scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were called upon to deal with. A man who has been trained to cope with storms, to foresee their coming, and to minimise their consequences, may be pardoned if he feels a certain reluctance to measure himself against a tornado.|$|E
6000|$|But thus {{much for}} the sixth reason, why Christ Jesus would have mercy offered {{in the first place}} to the biggest sinners, to wit, because such sinners, when converted, are apt to love him most. The Jerusalem sinners were they that outstripped, when they were converted, in some things, all the churches of the Gentiles. [...] "They were of one heart, and of one soul, neither said any of them, that aught <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> possessed was their own." [...] "Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the price of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet," [...] &c; Acts iv. 32-35. Now, shew me such another pattern if you can. But why did these do thus? Oh! they were Jerusalem sinners. These were the men that but a little before had killed the Prince of Life; and those to whom he did, that notwithstanding, send the first offer of grace and mercy. And the sense of this took them up betwixt the earth and the heaven, and carried them on in such ways and methods as could never be trodden by any since. They talk of the church of Rome, and set her in her {{primitive}} state, as a pattern and mother of churches; when the truth is, they were the Jerusalem sinners, when converts, that out-did all the churches that ever were.|$|E

50|$|A {{seasonal}} calendar {{allows the}} practitioner {{to look at}} seasonal trends that may affect the use or implementation of a service in a community. Seasonal trends may reveal decreases in the supply of labour, periods of hunger that may affect for example school children’s performance at school and so on. Seasonal calendars may reveal important reasons for the gaps between service utilization and intervention outcomes. This will allow the practitioner to plan for other things {{that may not have}} been considered as part of the intervention but which will greatly improve the quality of the intervention and make life better for the community members. To use the seasonal calendar as a data collection tool, the practitioner gets community members to write a list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have to do throughout the year. These things are related to work, cultural activities, certain times of the year in which participants are unavailable at all and so on, and to plot how they share them {{with other members of the}} community.|$|E

5000|$|A {{briefing}} for the DCI from 1959 {{mentions that}} [...] "as {{far back as}} 1956, we began to receive reports indicating spread of Tibetan revolt against Chinese communists through areas inhabited by Khamba tribes in eastern Tibet." [...] By May 1957, a rebel organization with its own fighting force was established {{with the support of}} the CIA. [...] This was the first time that many Tibetans had seen a white man in person. [...] They received training for the next five months. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were trained on included: modern weapons, guerrilla tactics, espionage, codes, and operation of hand-cranked radio transmitter/receivers. [...] Tibetans took this training very seriously and can be quoted stating that they [...] "lived to kill Chinese." [...] In late 1958 the CIA trained more Tibetans at Camp Hale and a total of 259 Tibetans over a five-year period were trained with tactics in Guerrilla warfare. The CIA established a secret military training camp called Camp Hale, located near Leadville, Colorado, where the Tibetans were trained to sabotage operations against the Communist Chinese. [...] The camp was closed in 1966, despite the conclusion of program training in 1961.|$|E
