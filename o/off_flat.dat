2500|$|Production {{start-up}} for the 2005 Mustang was on September 7, 2004, {{with the}} first 2005 model rolling <b>off</b> <b>Flat</b> Rock Assembly on September 27, 2004. U.S. market launch and customer delivery began {{at the end of}} October 2004, with production ending in late 2008 for the 2009 model. The 2005–2009 base Mustang was powered by Ford's cast iron block 4.0L Cologne SOHC V6, replacing the 3.8L Essex OHV V6 used in 2004 and older models. It produces 210hp (157kW) at 5300rpm and 240lb·ft (325N·m) of torque at 3500rpm and was mated to a standard Tremec T-5 5-speed manual transmission with Ford's 5R55S 5-speed automatic transmission available as an option. A 3.31:1 final drive ratio is standard with either transmission. In a comparison test with a Pontiac G6 Convertible conducted by Motor Trend magazine, a Mustang V6 convertible equipped with an automatic transmission was able to accelerate from zero to [...] in 7.3 seconds; 1.4 seconds better than the 2006 Pontiac G6 convertible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{your way}} of talking," [...] said Angelo, [...] "but I know you--I don't believe you thought of {{yourself}} at all. I keep that weapon yet that Luigi killed the man with, and I'll {{show it to you}} sometime. That incident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into Luigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a great Indian prince, the Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his family two or three centuries. It killed a good many disagreeable people who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another. It isn't much too look at, except it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or whatever it may be called--here, I'll draw it for you." [...] He took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch. [...] "There it is--a broad and murderous blade, with edges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it are the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's name added in Roman letters myself with our coat of arms, as you see. You notice what a curious handle the thing has. It is solid ivory, polished like a mirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as thick as a large man's wrist, with the end squared <b>off</b> <b>flat,</b> for your thumb to rest on; for you grasp it, with your thumb resting on the blunt end--so--and lift it along and strike downward. The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night was ended, Luigi had used the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it. The sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value. You will find a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself, of course." ...|$|E

50|$|R - Ricochet: Equips {{the ship}} with two options which orbit {{the ship in}} {{opposing}} directions, while changing the ship's attack to a green ball of energy. Upgrading causes the options to fire similar balls of energy forward diagonally up and down, which bounce <b>off</b> <b>flat</b> walls or ceilings, and increases overall damage. Its Smart Bomb attack combines the two options into a single homing drone which engages enemies at melee range, killing them before seeking a new target. Unlike other Smart Bomb attacks, the ship remains vulnerable during this attack; additionally, the drone will frequently seek out invulnerable portions of enemies to attack, reducing its usefulness against bosses.|$|E

These include the ability to swim, which includes being able to kick <b>off</b> <b>flat</b> surfaces whilst underwater, and the ability to use a weapon later on in the game, which features a chargeable attack. The game features a main story mode, in which the player must save his sister, Cutie Pants Girl, who has been kidnapped by a band of pirates who make her their captain. Each level contains two bonus rooms, a Micro-Trial, in which players must quickly chase a line of yellow squiggles, and stars which unlock extra content, including remakes of the first two worlds. The game also features local and online multiplayer for up to four players, as well as various challenges. Playing through the game allows the player to unlock hats, pants and weapons to customize their characters appearance.|$|E

5000|$|Pelican {{was sold}} as a supply ship on 22 January 1901 to the Hudson's Bay Company {{for use as a}} {{northern}} supply ship. During World War I, Pelican was delivering supplies to Russia when she was engaged by a surfaced U-boat. The fight lasted one-and=a-half hours, but eventually, the U-boat was driven off. In 1922, the ship was no longer considered serviceable and was sold as scrap to Fraim Bannikhin of St. John's for $1,500. However, the vessel was not scrapped, instead being reduced to a barge. In November 1922, the barge parted its hawser <b>off</b> <b>Flat</b> Point, while being towed to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The barge grounded near Sable Island. Pelican was recovered by the tugboat Ocean Eagle II and towed her towards Sydney. However, once in the harbour, the barge grounded again on the South Bar. The barge was recovered again and docked at Sydney. In 1927, the barge sank {{to the bottom of the}} harbour after being vandalized and her sea cocks opened. The hulk remained with masts, port gunwales and forecastle above water at the wharf for 23 years. [...] The hulk was towed out to sea, escorted by [...] and scuttled in June 1953.|$|E
50|$|Comparative {{hardness}} {{and density}} determine {{the results of}} collisions with bullets. Bullets tend to penetrate low density materials like air with little deflection, although friction causes rotated projectiles to drift {{in the direction of}} rifling twist as the bullet falls through the atmosphere under the influence of gravity. Ricochets may be similarly deflected in the direction of rotation of the side of a spin-stabilized bullet contacting a resistant surface. Dense objects tend to prevail in collisions with less dense objects; so dense bullets tend to penetrate less dense materials, and dense materials tend to deflect light bullets. Resistance to penetration can be evaluated as the sectional density of the target material along the axis of bullet movement in front of the bullet. Metallic foil will be more easily penetrated than metal ingots, and sectional density of sheet metal increases as orientation of the sheet diverges from perpendicular to, toward parallel with, the bullet path. Bullets are more likely to ricochet <b>off</b> <b>flat,</b> hard surfaces such as concrete or steel, but a ricochet can occur from irregular surfaces within heterogeneous materials including soil and vegetation. Uniformly soft, flexible materials like sand have a lower incidence of ricochet. Though it may not be intuitive, bullets easily ricochet off water; compare stone skipping.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new methodology that enables dynamically control of motion through modulating friction at coating surfaces by exposing with UV light. The principle {{is based on}} reversibly switching the surface topographies of the coating by light. The coating surface transfers from flat in the dark to corrugated {{in the presence of}} UV by forming regular ridge-like line gratings. Both the static and the kinetic friction coefficients are investigated in a dynamic manner by switching between the <b>off</b> (<b>flat</b> surface) and the activated (with ridges) state. By dynamically changing the friction, we are able to bring the sample from a static state into motion via UV exposure. When in motion, the friction coefficient can be altered further by modulating the light conditions. E. g. a smooth sliding can transfer into an interlocking state, or vice versa. Moreover, we can dynamically reduce the contact area in the interface and thus lowering friction forces...|$|E
40|$|I grew up eating pineapples in {{everything}}; well, {{nearly everything}} (let 2 ̆ 7 s not exaggerate). They were a sweetener, made things juicy.

40|$|To date, 12 macaque bipolar cell types {{have been}} described. This list {{includes}} all morphology types first outlined by Polyak (1941) using the Golgi method in the primate retina and subsequently identified by other researchers using electron microscopy (EM) {{combined with the}} Golgi method, serial section transmission EM (SSTEM), and immunohistochemical imaging. We used SSTEM for the rod-dense perifoveal area of macaque retina, reconfirmed ON (cone) bipolar cells to be classified as invaginating midget bipolar (IMB), diffuse bipolar (DB) 4, DB 5, DB 6, giant bipolar (GB), and blue bipolar (BB) types, and clarified their type-specific connectivity. DB 4 cells made reciprocal synapses {{with a kind of}} ON-OFF lateral amacrine cell, similar to OFF DB 2 cells. GB cells contacted rods and cones, similar to OFF DB 3 b cells. Retinal circuits formed by GB and DB 3 b cells are thought to substantiate the psychophysical finding of fast rod signals in mesopic vision. DB 6 cell output synapses were directed to ON midget ganglion (MG) cells at 70 % of ribbon contacts, similar to OFF DB 1 cells that directed 60 % of ribbon contacts to OFF MG cells. IMB cells contacted medium- or long-wavelength sensitive (M/L-) cones but not short-wavelength sensitive (S-) cones, while BB cells contacted S-cones but not M/L-cones. However, IMB and BB dendrites had similar morphological architectures, and a BB cell contacting a single S-cone resembled an IMB cell. Thus, both IMB and BB may be the ON bipolar counterparts of the <b>OFF</b> <b>flat</b> midget bipolar (FMB) type, likewise DB 4 of DB 2, DB 5 of DB 3 a, DB 6 of DB 1, and GB of DB 3 b OFF bipolar type. The ON DB plus GB, and OFF DB cells predominantly contacted M/L-cones and their outputs were directed mainly to parasol ganglion (PG) cells but also moderately to MG cells. BB cells directed S-cone-driven outputs almost exclusively to small bistratified ganglion (SBG) cells. Some FMB cells predominantly contacted S-cones and their outputs were directed to OFF MG cells. Thus two-step synaptic connections largely narrowed down the S-cone component to SBG and some OFF MG cells. The other OFF MG cells, ON MG cells, and ON and OFF PG cells constructed M/L-cone dominant pathways...|$|E
