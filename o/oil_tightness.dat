5000|$|Horizontal split of the crankcases {{offers the}} {{advantages}} of <b>oil</b> <b>tightness</b> through the elimination of vertical joints and one-step access to both the lower end and the gearbox. Oil pressure {{is provided by the}} trochoidal pump, driven by a steel spur gear off the crankshaft. The main bearings, crank pins, transmission main shaft, clutch bushing, shifter fork guide bar, and rocker arms are lubricated by pressurized oil, whereas the rest of the engine is lubricated by “oil splash.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The hollow axles, {{made from}} a chrome-molybdenum alloy, carry the massive wheels and the wheel set {{bearings}} at each end. The wheels are the typical German size, 1,250 mm, {{with a minimum of}} 1,170 mm after wear. The axles are mounted via hollow shafts into the gearbox casing, which, together with the traction motor, are designated the [...] "integrated common drive train", or IGA. Both the manufacturer and the DB were thereby hoping for greatly reduced maintenance costs, with its outstanding (and in 120 004 proven) <b>oil</b> leak <b>tightness,</b> which is also to the benefit of greater environmental protection.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In case {{of marine}} structures, fatigue cracks may {{initiate}} and propagate due to repeated wave exciting pressure. Propagation of fatigue crack causes not only instantaneous fracture but also loss of serviceability {{such as the}} <b>oil</b> and/or water <b>tightness</b> of a compartment. Fatigue cracks could be detected by periodic inspections, but it is sometimes {{difficult to find a}} crack due to bad accessibility or visibility. In order to manage the fatigue crack propagation, it is desirable to develop design method that renders cracks detectable and non-hazardous even though they may initiate. Such a design concept is studied by analyses and experiments in the present paper. A simulation system is also used as a tool to obtain the paths and growth-behavior of a fatigue crack. This system may also be used to determine the timing of repair of fatigue cracks found during in-service inspection...|$|R
40|$|The {{high number}} of {{competitive}} industries in the world, many companies competing – to reach the higher output, so that many machines with advanced technology {{have to come to}} get maximum results. The production of high-tech machinery that produced to the maximum, but the high-tech machines can also harm the employee / operator. Lack of knowledge and carelessness can cause a very fatal accident. PT. Siantar TOP is a company engaged in the manufacture of snack products which are produced in the form of snacks (snacks). K 3 has realized the importance of coaching towards zero accident conditions. Various potential sources of danger easily found in a corporate environment, demonstrated by the example data as follows: Raw materials in the form of starch cause <b>tightness,</b> <b>oil</b> cause burns, as well as machines - production cause injury to the operator. Therefore, the management felt the need to identify potential hazards (Hazards) and determine the value of the risks arising Hazards. Measuring the success rate of implementation of the K 3 program based solely on the number of output parameters accidents, less objective because it does not consider the process taken to get the output. Internal Audit is used by the PT. TOP Siantar far too much emphasis on the parameters of the accident, but the checklist used are of a general nature that can not be objectively indicate {{the extent to which the}} achievement of program implementation. The results of these audits will give an idea of the level of achievement of program implementation K 3 and recommendations or suggestions regarding the deficiencies that need to be fixed and successes that need to be maintained and further enhanced. In this study developed measurement model K 3 successful implementation of the program combined with the parameter number of accidents that occur and K 3 program implementation process. It also made the identification and categorization of the hazards. The results of this research is the achievement level of program implementation at PT Siantar K 3 -TOP by 83. 66...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the penetration depth (PD), the thickness of the oxygen inhibition layer (<b>OIL)</b> and the <b>tightness</b> of a fissure sealant (Helioseal, Vivadent) and various adhesives (Heliobond, Excite, Vivadent; Resulcin, Merz; Solobond M, Voco; Prompt L-Pop, 3 M-Espe) applied to enamel lesions in vitro. From 27 bovine teeth 54 enamel specimens were prepared and covered with nail varnish (control), thus obtaining three windows for treatment. After demineralisation (pH 5. 0, 14 d) two of the windows were etched with phosphoric acid (20 %, 5 s), whereas the third area served as control. The specimens were divided randomly into six groups (n= 9) and the respective adhesive was applied (90 s) either once or twice. Light-curing followed after each application. Half of the area of each specimen window was then covered with nail varnish and the samples were stored in the demineralising solution again (pH 5. 0, 14 d). The specimens were cut perpendicular to the surface. A sample half served as control. Enamel slabs were studied after infiltration with a fluorescent low viscous resin using confocal microscopy (CLSM). The image of the lesion was divided into two areas with different grey values. Lesion depths were calculated (ImageJ) from the surface to that point in the lesion where the grey value clearly changed to a darker grey value. The zone with the darker grey values marked the front of demineralisation. Mean lesion depths (SD) after demineralisation (14 d) were measured at 105 (21) µm. After single application, Resulcin [89 (22) %] and Helioseal [98 (6) %] had almost completely penetrated the lesion. Heliobond [126 (33) %] and Excite [184 (40) %] penetrated even deeper than the defined lesion. For Excite double application decreased the OIL significantly (p= 0. 03; adjusted paired t-test). After the second demineralisation the untreated lesions showed a mean progression of 52 (31) %. Helioseal, Heliobond, Resulcin Monobond and Excite were able to inhibit lesion progression completely (p 0. 05; t-test). After twice application of Solobond M a significantly decreased lesion progression (p< 0. 05; t-test) could be observed. The other materials proved to be significantly better in hampering further lesion progression (p< 0. 05; ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). The development of such treatment strategies could offer potential noninvasive means of treating early enamel lesions. Adhesives are capable to penetrate artificial initial enamel lesions completely...|$|R
