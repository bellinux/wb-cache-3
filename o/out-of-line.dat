"Borderline" [...] {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in Los Angeles, California from January 30 to February 2, 1984 {{and was the first}} video that Madonna made with director Mary Lambert, who later also directed the videos [...] "Like a Virgin", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". Author Allen Metz noted how the video portrayed Madonna's then [...] "burgeoning star quality". It is regarded as one of her career-making moments when the video was started to be shown on MTV. She acted as the girlfriend of a Hispanic street guy who is picked up by a British photographer who publishes her picture on a magazine cover. The portrayal of the street life and high-fashion scene in the video was a reference to Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she used to haunt while her career was beginning, as well as the world of popularity and success she was experiencing at that moment. The storyline involved her being emotionally torn between the photographer and her boyfriend. Madonna's boyfriend in the video is portrayed as Latino, and her struggles with this relationship depicted the struggle Hispanic women faced with their men. Lambert said that there was [...] "no formula" [...] used when making the [...] "Borderline" [...] video and that they were [...] "inventing it as we went along." [...] In the January 1997 issue of Rolling Stone, Lambert described the video and its plot as, [...] "Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's <b>out-of-line</b> reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{single-chain}} system, {{the chain}} {{runs from the}} top of a chainring attached to the cranks {{to the top of a}} sprocket attached to the rear wheel hub with a freewheel, as with most bicycle chain drives. The chain then, usually, wraps around the rear sprocket to an idler sprocket between the rear wheel and the cranks, then runs back to a second sprocket attached to the rear wheel with a second freewheel, and finally returns to the bottom of the chain ring. Other configurations are possible, including one chain for forward pedalling, and a second crossed-chain configuration for reverse pedalling. Only one freewheel is engaged at a time, while the other spins backward freely. Since the chain wraps around the second sprocket in the opposite direction to the first sprocket, the cyclist needs only to pedal backwards to engage it. The small amount of <b>out-of-line</b> required of the chain is easily accommodated. The rear wheel cannot rotate backwards because the two freewheels try to drive the pedals forward and backward at the same time.|$|E

The linear array consists of two identical subarrays which are located oppositely. By the antiphase feeding of two subarrays, the cross-polarization is further reduced. Furthermore, the theory analyses of the series-fed array indicate that it is competent for being applied to phased array systems. The simulated results show the cross-polarization levels of the linear array with 20 novel elements in E and H plane are lower than − 30 dB and − 60 dB, respectively.

Many improvements to the WAM have been suggested and also the problem of efficient code generation was extensively studied from several perspectives: ffl program transformation (e. g., unfold/fold transformations [5], global flow analysis [15]) ffl mode and type inference [4, 6, 16] ffl clause indexing [...] ...|$|E

Introduction There is a large efficiency gap between most widely used Prolog implementations and implementations of imperative languages such as C. Often a Prolog program will run roughly an order of magnitude slower than an equivalent program in an imperative language. The underlying cause is lack of information. A Prolog predicate can not be implemented efficiently without knowledge of the context in which it will be used. For example, the unification of two predicate arguments, in the absence of other information, is such an expensive operation that it requires a call to an <b>out-of-line</b> routine. This will involve the execution of many machine instructions. If instead it is known that these arguments will always be atoms it is [...] ...|$|E

Since its horizontal location {{corresponds to the}} volcanic front and the appearance {{is similar to a}} melt lens reflector observed in volcanic regions (Arai et al. 2017 a), the reflector appears to represent a magmatic feature. However, caution is needed when interpreting its depth: The estimated depth is significantly greater than that found in the southern Okinawa Trough (i.e., 4  km depth below the seafloor) (Arai et al. 2017 a). In addition, the P wave velocity model does not show any low-velocity anomaly indicative of a magmatic body at this location (Fig.  1 c).

It runs on a microcomputer-based development system without virtual memory. An attribute grammar was written describing semantic analysis, storage allocation, and translation to intermediate code.

Various techniques for optimizing the evaluator were tried. Their degree or success is reported and they are compared with other ideas from the literature. Complex attribute-values, such as sets, sequences and finite functions, were carefully implemented using applicative data structure in order to conserve memory.

40|$|Several applications, {{including}} those in the energy sector that require high thermal efficiency, {{such as those in}} the solar energy industry, require a careful thermal analysis of heat exchange components. In this regard, thermal resistance is a major cause of exergy destruction and must be minimised as much as possible, but also adequately designed. In the past, a number of correlations have been developed to predict heat transfer coefficients in compact heat exchangers. The designers of such heat exchangers often exploit the development of thermal boundary layers to achieve higher overall efficiency due to increases in local heat transfer coefficients. However, most of the correlations that have been developed for heat exchangers neglect the specific effect of the thermal boundary layer development in the inlet region, and instead only offer effective average heat transfer coefficients, which most users assume to be constant throughout the heat exchanger. This is often an over-simplification and leads to over-designed heat exchangers. In this study, focus is placed on annular flow passages with uniform heating on the inner wall. This geometry has many applications. This study aims to collect experimental heat transfer data for water at various flow rates and inlet geometries, to process the data and determine local and overall heat transfer coefficients, and to develop an improved local heat transfer coefficient correlation. Experimental tests were performed on a horizontal concentric tube-in-tube heat exchanger with a length of 1. 05 m and a diameter ratio of 0. 648. The surface of the inner tube was treated with thermochromic liquid crystals (TLCs), which allowed for high-resolution temperature mapping of the heated surface when combined with an automated camera position system in order to determine local heat transfer coefficients. Conventional in-line and <b>out-of-line</b> annular inlet configurations were evaluated for Reynolds numbers from 2 000 to 7 500, as well as the transition from laminar to turbulent flow for a single in-line inlet configuration. It was found that the local heat transfer coefficients were significantly higher at the inlets, and decreased as the boundary layers developed. With the high resolution of the results, the local heat transfer coefficients were investigated in detail. Local maximum and minimum heat transfer coefficients were identified where the thermal boundary layers merged for high turbulent flow cases. The annular inlet geometries only influenced the heat transfer for Reynolds numbers larger than 4 000, for which larger inlets are favoured. <b>Out-of-line</b> inlet geometries are not favoured for heat transfer. A new heat transfer correlation was developed from the experimental data, based on an existing heat transfer correlation for turbulent flow in an annular flow passage, considering the boundary layer development. The new correlation estimated the area-weighted heat transfer coefficients within 10 % of the experimental data and closely followed trends for local heat transfer coefficients.

40|$|A report {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} reduce the risk of accidental ignition of certain upper-stage rocket motors or other high energy hazardous systems. At present, mechanically in-line initiators are used for initiation of many rocket motors and/or other high-energy hazardous systems. Electrical shorts and/or mechanical barriers, which are the basic safety devices in such systems, are typically removed as part of final arming or pad preparations while personnel are present. At this time, static discharge, test equipment malfunction, or incorrect arming techniques can cause premature firing. The proposal calls for a modular <b>out-of-line</b> ignition system incorporating detonating-cord elements, identified as the donor and the acceptor, separated by an air gap. In the safe configuration, the gap would be sealed with two shields, which would prevent an accidental firing of the donor from igniting the system. The shields would be removed to enable normal firing, in which shrapnel generated by the donor would reliably ignite the acceptor to continue the ordnance train. The acceptor would then ignite a through bulkhead initiator (or other similar device), which would ignite the motor or high-energy system. One shield would be remotely operated and would be moved to the armed position when a launch was imminent or conversely returned to the safe position if the launch were postponed. In the event of failure of the remotely operated shield, the other shield could be inserted manually to safe the system...|$|E
40|$|Polyynes are {{molecular}} systems {{characterized by}} π‐conjugated chains of carbon atoms in sp hybridization state. Unlike sp 2 π‐conjugated systems, polyynes are formed by carbon chains with alternating single and triple bonds with no hydrogen bonded to the conjugated carbons [1]. Under this regard, polyynes constitute a truly one-dimensional system, being essentially atomic wires made of carbon. Among sp 2 π-conjugated carbon systems, graphene is usually considered a flat planar system, but studies have proven that its peculiar out‐of‐plane dynamics {{is responsible for}} the negative in‐plane thermal expansion coefficient of graphite [2]. Similarly, while polyynes could be naively considered to be essentially linear systems, a recent spectroscopic study has shown the presence of an <b>out‐of‐line</b> bending effect as the polyyne chain length is increased [3]. In this contribution, IR and Raman spectroscopy are used to examine the vibrational characteristics of a series of three macrocyclic tetraynes [4] in comparison to an acyclic analog. By changing the length of the alkyl tether of the macrocycles, varying degrees of bending of the tetrayne moiety can be achieved. The joint use of IR and Raman spectroscopy provides a quantitative probe of the bending of the sp‐chain. The spectroscopic data show a general trend toward increasing activation of Raman bands in the IR spectra, and vice versa, as bending of the polyyne chain is increased.
