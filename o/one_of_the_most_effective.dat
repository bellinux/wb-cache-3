5|$|Arthur Webb Mold (27 May 1863– 29 April 1921) was an English {{professional}} cricketer {{who played}} first-class cricket for Lancashire as a fast bowler between 1889 and 1901. A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1892, {{he was selected}} for England in three Test matches in 1893. Mold was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> bowlers in England during the 1890s but his career was overshadowed by controversy over his bowling action. Although he took 1,673 wickets in first-class matches, many commentators viewed his achievements as tainted.|$|E
5|$|Eunuchs gained {{unprecedented}} {{power over}} state affairs during the Ming dynasty. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> {{means of control}} was the secret service stationed in {{what was called the}} Eastern Depot {{at the beginning of the}} dynasty, later the Western Depot. This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial, hence this state organ's often totalitarian affiliation. Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks, only theirs had four grades instead of nine.|$|E

5|$|General Plumer was {{eventually}} appointed to command II Corps in December 1914, and succeeded Smith-Dorrien {{in command of}} the Second Army in 1915. He had commanded a mounted infantry detachment in the Second Boer war, where he started to build his reputation. He held command of the Ypres salient for three years and gained an overwhelming victory over the German Army at the battle of Messines in 1917. Plumer is generally recognised as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> of the senior British commanders on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> {{is the presence}} of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E

5|$|Donald Maynard Brashear (born January 7, 1972) is a Canadian-American former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} player {{who played for}} five organizations in the National Hockey League (NHL), {{in which he was}} considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> enforcers. His aggressive style led to being among the League leaders in penalty minutes for six seasons, while currently ranking 15th all-time in NHL history, and resulted in multiple suspensions as well. He remains the Vancouver Canucks all-time single season leader in penalty minutes, which he set in the 1997–98 season.

5|$|Hedley Verity (18 May 1905– 31 July 1943) was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England between 1930 and 1939. A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, he took 1,956wickets in first-class cricket {{at an average of}} 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40Tests at an average of 24.37. Named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is regarded as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be almost impossible to bat against.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of his {{personal}} style, Cubitt was credited by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but very costly attack in April 1918; under Major General Cubitt's command, the division mounted two further major operations, at the Battle of Albert in August and Battle of Cambrai in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, and a highly effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank it as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> British divisions during the Hundred Days Offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory {{that he would}} have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize. As al-Atrash's men headed towards Damascus to launch their attack against French forces there, al-Bakri assembled some 260 armed volunteers from various neighborhoods and villages in and around Damascus, including al-Shaghour, Bab Musalla, al-Midan, and Jaramana. Al-Bakri maintained particularly close ties to Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> rebel bands in the country. When the French authorities were informed of nationalist rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, his brothers, and al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 the French command {{found that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war contributions and started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance. During the winter of 1694-1695, the inhabitants of Calella repelled a punishment force of 800 or 1,000 French soldiers from the Blanes garrison and killed between 60 or 100 of them. French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces, the miquelets, who laid ambushes to Noailles' forces from woods and heights. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer of Vic, who achieved two victories over the French during the winter: on late December he overran a convoy on way to Hostalric, killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 prisoners, and on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata, killing 7 of them and taking 28 prisoners and 32 horses.|$|E
