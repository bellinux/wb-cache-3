5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning {{for the government to}} move them to the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E

5|$|Continuing their explorations, {{they reach}} a {{universe}} where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures {{out how to}} modify the remote device {{so that they can}} return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family– who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human– hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device {{that would allow them to}} return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, Peter, and is sent to the pound where he is to be euthanized later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.|$|E

Steinbeck often wrote about poor, working-class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life.

25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life.</b> In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed {{to see so many}} boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two decades after the 1948 war ended, between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews fled or were {{expelled}} from the Arab countries they were living in, in many cases owing to anti-Jewish sentiment, expulsion (in the case of Egypt), or, in the case of Iraq, legal oppression but also quite often to promises <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> from Israel; of this number, two-thirds ended up in refugee camps in Israel, while the remainder migrated to France, the United States and other Western or Latin American countries. The Jewish refugee camps in Israel were evacuated with time and the refugees were eventually integrated in the Jewish Israeli society (which in fact consisted almost entirely of refugees from Arab and European states). Israel argued that this and the Palestinian exodus represented a population exchange between Arab nations and the Jewish nation.|$|E

More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims.

25|$|Short and {{frequently}} ended through violence, Phanariote rules were usually marked by political corruption, intrigue, and high taxation, {{as well as}} by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory; nonetheless, they also saw attempts at legislative and administrative modernization inspired by The Enlightenment (such as Constantine Mavrocordatos' decision to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as Scarlat Callimachi's Code), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} Europe in 1914 reduced European immigration to the United States to a trickle, and the low wage labor supply that filled Northern factories contracted sharply. With U.S. entry into the War on April 16, 1917, the military draft depleted the labor pool even further. Lured by manufacturing jobs and the promise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>life</b> in the North, Blacks began a massive migration to Northern industrial centers, and by 1920 over 300,000 had relocated to Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland. The sudden exodus of their labor pool, and therefore their economic security, sent alarm throughout White communities in the South. Whites in the North reacted with similar consternation over the influx of Blacks into their cities. Southern White anger over increasing race assertiveness of Blacks, and Northern White concerns about Black migration, led to more virulent racism and frequent outbreaks of racial violence. After the War ended on November 11, 1918, the tense atmosphere exploded {{during the summer of}} 1919. On April 2, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, ushering a period of social, racial, and political turbulence.|$|E

At the age of 12 he displayed a remarkable passion and talent for cricket and it was through sheer luck that his talent was discovered in the playground by a cricket mad teacher, Pete Bolland. Later that year in 1983, he was selected for the Warwickshire Under 13's team where his potential as a leader was spotted very early, resulting in him being awarded the captaincy. Khan was the only state school boy in that team. His determination to succeed was evidenced by the fact that despite having never played hard ball cricket before, he top scored in his first year. Khan only had one dream and that was to make it at the highest grade and play professional cricket. As a young boy, he would find ways to get into Edgbaston to watch Warwickshire play and vowed to his friends that one day, he too would be out there.|$|E
