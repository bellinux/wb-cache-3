5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} is one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> horticultural botany which is mostly {{carried out in}} botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E

Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.|$|E
