5000|$|Hollow spheres {{are used}} as a {{lightweight}} filler in composite materials such as syntactic foam and lightweight concrete.

50|$|With the bubbler pool gone, a {{meltdown}} was {{less likely to}} produce a powerful steam explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor.

Using <b>oil</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment,</b> the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May.

50|$|Originally {{the term}} {{was used in the}} {{traveling}} carnivals of 19th-century United States, almost interchangeably with roustabout. By the 1930s the terms had transferred to the <b>oil</b> <b>drilling</b> industry.

By contrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and unloading cargo from crane baskets and assisting welders, mechanics, electricians and other skilled workers.

40|$|So far direct diode lasers are {{not very}} common for laser {{cladding}} applications {{in the field of}} surface protection, remanufacturing and rapid prototyping, since they have a low beam quality and usually a rectangular or line shaped spot with a short working distance. However, their extreme compact size, ease of operation, high wall plug efficiency and lower investment and running costs makes them very interesting for laser cladding, especially in an industrial environment. In this study a diode laser coating process for cladding of <b>oil</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment</b> is presented, which was developed a the Fraunhofer Center for Coatings and Laser Applications. In order to develop a simple and cost efficient system for laser cladding, a direct diode laser was modified to match the required beam profile. In the first attempt to increase the working distance and to scale the focus size, one lens of the focusing optics was removed. To further increase the spot size, the laser beam was defocused below its focal plane. In a second step the laser spot was made square in the focal plane by readjusting the diode stacks inside the laser head. Thereby it was also possible to achieve a relatively smooth intensity distribution. To obtain the needed spot size of approximately 6 x 6 mm(exp 2), a lens with 300 mm focal length was used. Thus the process could be run in the focus of the laser, which has a specified spot geometry. The result was increased stability of the cladding process with a large parameter window. Porosity free and near crack free nickel based coatings with a high content of globular WC were applied to metal surfaces of oil milling equipment. Besides the process description, an example of laser integration into a 3 -axis milling workstation is presented...|$|E

5000|$|Japan had conquered all of Manchuria {{and most}} of coastal China by 1939, but the Allies refused to {{recognize}} the conquests and stepped up their commitment. [...] President Franklin Roosevelt arranged for American pilots and ground crews {{to set up an}} aggressive Chinese Air Force nicknamed the Flying Tigers that would not only defend against Japanese air power but also start bombing the Japanese islands. [...] Diplomacy provided very little space for the adjudication of the deep differences between Japan and the United States. The United States was firmly and almost unanimously committed to defending the integrity of China. The isolationism that characterized the astrong opposition of many Americans toward war in Europe did not apply to Asia. Japan had no friends in the United States, nor in Great Britain, nor the Netherlands. The United States had not yet declared war on Germany, but was closely collaborating with Britain and the Netherlands regarding the Japanese threat. United States started to move its newest B-17 heavy bombers to bases in the Philippines, well within range of Japanese cities. The goal was deterrence of any Japanese attacks to the south. Furthermore, plans were well underway to ship American air forces to China, where American pilots in Chinese uniforms flying American warplanes, were preparing to bomb Japanese cities well before Pearl Harbor. [...] Great Britain, although realizing it could not defend Hong Kong, was confident in its abilities to defend its major base in Singapore and the surrounding Malaya Peninsula. When the war did start in December 1941, Australian soldiers were rushed Singapore, weeks before Singapore surrendered, and all the Australian and British forces were sent to prisoner of war camps. [...] the Netherlands, with its homeland overrun by Germany, had a small Navy to defend the Dutch East Indies. Their role was to delay the Japanese invasion long enough to destroy the <b>oil</b> wells, <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment,</b> refineries and pipelines that were the main target of Japanese attacks.|$|R
