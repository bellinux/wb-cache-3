5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was {{stranded}} on Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} mechanical problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open at Souhesmes.|$|E
5|$|Davison {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} family, and studied at Royal Holloway College, London, and St Hugh's College, Oxford, before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the {{organisation}} and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palace of Westminster—including {{on the night of the}} 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the union. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in Morpeth, Northumberland.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the application of various time series methods in order to forecast <b>the</b> monthly <b>overnights</b> <b>in</b> Azorean hotels. <b>The</b> aim {{is to find out}} {{the degree to which the}} forecast of overnights segmented by country of origin, presents smaller errors when compared with the forecast of <b>the</b> total <b>overnights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Region. The appropriate forecasting method by a tourist’s country of origin, is also analyzed so that potential optimal combinations of separate forecasts can be found in order to forecast <b>the</b> total <b>overnights</b> <b>in</b> Azores...|$|R

5|$|The band's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} grow over the coming years. As the younger band members completed their high school studies, they performed frequent concerts in Antananarivo, staying <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> student dorms with Raoul and Nono. Fafa moved to Antananarivo the shortly afterward {{to live with his}} parents, and the band often gathered at his family's home, where they composed many of their early songs. As each of the younger boys passed their baccalaureat, they moved to Antananarivo to continue their studies at the university, which they paid through a combination of state subsidies and the profits from their concerts. Political party representatives often approached band members to request them to become official supporters and party members, but the band preferred to remain politically independent.Another young and emerging group, Lolo sy ny Tariny, was recruited by the political party MFM, who attempted to pit the two groups against each other. Although there were occasional arguments between Bekoto and members of Lolo sy ny Tariny that garnered publicity, the band remained largely above political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E

25|$|A storage {{heating system}} takes {{advantage}} of cheaper electricity prices, sold during low demand periods such as <b>overnight.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, this is branded as Economy 7. The storage heater stores heat in clay bricks, then releases it during the day when required. Newer storage heaters are able {{to be used with}} various tariffs. Whilst they can still be used with economy 7, they can be used with day-time tariffs. This is due to the modern design features that are added during manufacturing. Alongside new designs the use of a thermostat or sensor has improved the efficiency of the storage heater. A thermostat or sensor is able to read the temperature of the room, and change the output of the heater accordingly.|$|E
