5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does not rely <b>on</b> <b>pace,</b> physical attributes and tackling {{like a typical}} ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, {{as well as}} rib {{and knee}} {{injuries}} sustained during the 2004 World Cup, Jovanovski was inactive during the 2004–05 season. When the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Jovanovski was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> for a career year, but his season was interrupted by groin, foot and abdominal injuries. He finished with 33 points in 44 games for a career-high 0.75 points-per-game average. The Canucks suffered from Jovanovski missing the final 27 {{games of the season}} and did not qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Following the 2005–06 season, Jovanovski did not receive a contract offer from the Canucks, subsequently becoming an unrestricted free agent. The decision to let him go was influenced by the re-signings of Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as the acquisition of goaltender Roberto Luongo, leaving no room on the team's salary cap to retain Jovanovski.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{had more}} {{success in the}} tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all {{first-class}} fixtures. This ranked him third among the Australians in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages. He bowled more overs than everyone but Bill Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, and conserve their energy for the Tests. Johnson's most successful match with the ball was against Gloucestershire, in which he took match figures of 11/100. He was also more prolific with the bat outside the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset. He also made 80 against a Marylebone Cricket Club team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour.|$|E
5|$|Tallon had had {{moderate}} {{success with}} his batting during the Test series, aggregating 114runs at 28.50. In 14 first-class matches, he scored 283 runs at 25.72. The Australian team strategy of primarily depending <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests; however, Bradman rested his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall during the tour games {{to save energy}} for the Tests and allowed the spinners do more work, so that overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the tour. Bradman deemed Tallon more agile than Saggers and better at taking acrobatic catches. Tallon's performances during the English summer saw him named by Wisden {{as one of its}} five Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games Taylor was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers broke their two-game {{losing streak}} as Ricky Bell set a club record with 167 rushing yards, while Doug Williams threw for two touchdowns and rushed for a third. The total of 228 rushing yards was 7 yards {{shy of the}} team record set in the {{previous}} game against the Packers, and left the Buccaneers as the only team with two rushers <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to break the 1,000-yard mark. Packers quarterback David Whitehurst threw for a career-best 261 yards, although the Packers never entered the end zone. Jeris White intercepted a potential touchdown pass that slipped out of James Lofton's hands. The win left the Buccaneers at midseason having already achieved their highest win total ever.|$|E

5|$|A pre-Le Mans testing day {{was held}} at the circuit on 31 May, {{involving}} all 56 entries as well as the KCMG Oreca-Nissan, Ibañez Oreca-Nissan, Gulf Racing Porsche, and Formula Racing Ferrari reserve entries. Two LMP3 class Ginetta vehicles and two additional AF Corse Ferrari cars also participated. The two four-hour sessions were held under mixed weather conditions as rain swept through the area several times. Neel Jani set the fastest time in the early session with a three minutes and 21.945 seconds for the No. 18 Porsche, but Hartley improved to a three minutes and 21.061 seconds in the sister No. 17 Porsche. Audi's best time was a three minutes and 22.307 seconds for Marco Bonanomi in the No. 9 car, while Toyota could only muster a three minutes and 25.321 seconds lap. Laurens Vanthoor was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped Aston Martin also lead in LMGTE Am. The session served as the first appearance for the trio of Nissan GT-R LM Nismo amongst its World Endurance Championship competitors, although the cars were not <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> with the LMP1 field.|$|E

5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted saying she had no business playing and he hoped she missed the cut, although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing the cut. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E
5|$|Among third basemen, Wade Boggs has won {{the most}} Silver Slugger Awards, winning eight times with the rival Boston Red Sox (six) and New York Yankees (two). In the National League, Mike Schmidt leads with six wins; Schmidt won the first five National League Silver Slugger Awards at third base from 1980, when he led the Philadelphia Phillies to the World Series, to 1984 before his streak was broken by Tim Wallach. Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez has won three American League Silver Sluggers at the position, and has ten wins in his career as he {{accumulated}} seven wins at shortstop with the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. Two National League third basemen have also won three Silver Sluggers. Matt Williams won the award in 1990, 1993, and 1994, when he was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to tie Roger Maris' home run record of 61 before the players' strike; Vinny Castilla won three awards in four years for the Colorado Rockies (1995, 1997–1998). Chase Headley and Miguel Cabrera are the most recent winners.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, Young had {{a no-hitter}} through 8⅓ innings {{of the game}} against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This {{would have been the}} first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> for a perfect game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{report from}} the Working Party of the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group {{recommends}} the use of more sophisticated pacemakers in most patients.

Their impact <b>on</b> <b>pacing</b> practice and the immediate costs of pacemaker hardware in the Northern Region were retrospectively audited...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{technique}} of transoesophageal atrial stimulation (TAS), the effects of body position, interelectrode spacing and electrode surface area <b>on</b> <b>pacing</b> threshold were assessed in two substudies. The effects of intra-oesophageal local anaesthesia and of two different <b>pacing</b> wave configurations <b>on</b> <b>pacing</b> threshold and discomfort were also assessed. Substudy I comprised 16 subjects (3 patients {{with a history of}} paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 13 healthy volunteers) and substudy II comprised 16 healthy volunteers. TAS was performed using a hexapolar luminal prototype oesophageal electrode catheter. In substudy I bipolar pacing was performed in the semi-supine and left decubitus body positions for different pulse durations (20, 10, 6 and 2 ms), interelectrode pole distances (10 to 24 mm) and electrode pole surface areas (0. 22 to 0. 66 cm 2). In substudy II TAS was performed with square wave and triangular waveform pulses after intra-oesophageal saline and lidocaine 20 mg/ml. These solutions were given in random order. Neither the interelectrode distance nor electrode surface areas had any significant influence <b>on</b> <b>pacing</b> thresholds. Stimulation thresholds were not affected by body position. Intraoesophageal lidocaine did not affect the discomfort experienced. Peak pacing thresholds using a triangular waveform were significantly higher than thresholds using a square waveformn (p < 0. 001). The optimal pacing technique for TAS remains to be defined. The TAS-induced pain is probably not generated from the oesophageal mucous membrane. There is a significant difference in pacing thresholds between triangular and square waveforms...|$|R
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{announced}} its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 {{would be required}} to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft {{by the end of the}} year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor'kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2's AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E
5|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the 2010–11 season, Edler {{continued}} to improve and was <b>on</b> <b>pace</b> to record new career-highs in goals, assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis told reporters that Edler had been experiencing tightness in his back at several times in the season, but an open-ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed to his back problems. Edler underwent microdisectomy surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two-and-a-half months, returning for the second-last game of the regular season. Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games, he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring, behind Ehrhoff. His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks. As the Canucks won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time in}} franchise history, the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the team lost the series in seven games. Following their defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries, including Edler, who played Game 7 with two broken fingers. He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) in 25 games.|$|E
