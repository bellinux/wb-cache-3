5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the <b>original</b> <b>issue</b> price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

25|$|Copyrightthe {{idea that}} {{an author of}} a work has rights on the uses and the {{reproduction}} of the workoriginated {{in the field of}} literature. With the inventions of the printing press and of movable type, copies of literary works could be made quicker and cheaper than before, and the works could be disseminated more widely. But the unrestricted rivalry amongst print shops led quickly to the dissemination of competing and unauthorized editions of various works, which diminished prospects of any payment, or even entailed loss, for the authors, editors, and printers of the <b>original</b> <b>issue,</b> and thus discouraged further undertaking. European rulers also quickly realized that the granting of legal monopolies on wide distribution of printed works could be employed for political purposesnot only by themselves, but also by their opponents. The printing business was soon regulated through printing prerogatives granted by the rulers to print shops, authorizing them to print certain works and giving them a monopoly on these works. Such monopolies not only served as a market regulator but also as a censorship device, as they could be revoked if the printed works were not to the liking of the ruler.|$|E

500|$|The large {{quantities}} {{possessed by the}} Lady Managers {{made their way into}} the market through dealers and other vendors in the 1920s. [...] By 1930, prices had risen to the <b>original</b> <b>issue</b> price; by 1955, uncirculated specimens sold for $20. [...] The pieces are popular among collectors because they are the only U.S. quarter dollars issued strictly as a commemorative, not for circulation. [...] The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the piece as ranging between $450 in almost uncirculated AU-50 on the Sheldon coin grading scale and $6,000 in near-pristine MS-66.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the coins}} were minted, the {{commission}} began sales at $2 each. [...] After February 1900, when the commission moved its offices from Chicago to Paris, sales were {{handled by the}} American Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago. Only small numbers were sold to coin collectors. Sales, conducted through the bank, continued for several years. [...] Prices initially dropped on the secondary market—the pieces could be purchased for $1.10 in 1903—and thousands may have been released into circulation, or were spent by purchasers in hard times. By 1920, the market price passed the <b>original</b> <b>issue</b> price, and thereafter prices rose steadily, reaching $3.50 by 1930, $5 {{at the height of}} the commemorative coin boom in July 1936, $13 by 1950, $55 by 1960, and $650 by 1975.|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{original}} stereo LP release in May 1974, the album {{had a short}} supply and distribution due to the Strata-East label's independent distribution policy of their artists' releases. Consequently, Winter in America became considered by many fans to be the great [...] "lost" [...] Gil Scott-Heron album, before a proper reissue on compact disc thirty years following its <b>original</b> <b>issue.</b> The album served as the first of their collaborations to have Jackson receive co-billing for a release. Unlike Scott-Heron's previous albums, Winter in America experienced some commercial success {{with the help of}} promotional resources in the form of underground music deejays and club promoters, in spite of the album's limited distribution. While it did not chart on the U.S. Billboard Pop Albums chart, the album charted on the Top Jazz Albums chart and peaked at number six. Winter in America entered the Top Jazz Albums on June 29, 1974 and remained there for 40 weeks, until March 29, 1975. According to a 1990 Los Angeles Times article on Scott-Heron, the album ended up selling more than 300,000 copies.|$|E

He served in the Continental Congress and in the Constitutional First Congress framed the Bill of Rights. Secretary of State under President Jefferson, his own presidency saw the War of 1812. Madison reappeared on the 2-dollar stamp of the Second Bureau Issue (1902–08), which was designed by R. Ostrander Smith from a painting by an unknown artist.
