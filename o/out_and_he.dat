5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E

In 1910, he accepted a job offer to work in a machine tool company in Vermont. He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader philosophy of the role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E

The 45 minutes of qualifying were split into parts of eighteen, fifteen and twelve minutes of running respectively. While Sauber were able to place Felipe Nasr in a new car in time for qualifying following his accident in practice, Jenson Button's problems could not be sorted <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> missed the session, meaning that his participation in the race would be left to a decision by the race stewards.|$|E
5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, {{who said that}} the current owners had allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, if not the sanitized H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 lights were burnt <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> did not believe the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|Chris is {{suspended}} from school {{when he gets}} into a fight with a rival basketball captain. When his parents {{find out about the}} fight and that he is gay, they throw Chris <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> stays with Summer. She later breaks down and reveals that she is struggling with his sexuality. Chris reassures her that it is not her fault he is gay and their friendship becomes stronger. Chris befriends Natasha and helps her and Summer to make up when they fall out. After receiving lower grades than expected, Chris reconsiders attending university.

Warren witnesses them playing pool and warns Chris to stay away from Blake. Chris is later attacked while working and Lucas takes him to the hospital, but Chris leaves before getting his x-rays. He later collapses and Rhys Lawson has to perform emergency surgery to get Chris breathing again.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E

When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas {{for six months and}} took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} began on 15 May and {{stretched}} from Rome to Florence. The racing {{that day was}} marred by heavy rain, which led to ten withdrawals. Carlo Galetti won the stage ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Dario Beni. The next leg was also dogged by rain and very poor conditions {{on the road and}} saw the climbing of the Colle de Bacco. Giovanni Gerbi was the first rider to summit the Colle de Bacco. The climb wore Gerbi <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was caught and passed by three riders and ultimately finished fourth on the stage. Vincenzo Borgarello was the first rider to cross the finish line in Genoa and won the stage, where a large crowd waited for the riders to finish. Rossignoli took the race lead after finishing two positions in front of Galetti. The race's third day of racing was the first to have clear weather. Race leader Rossignoli bested the likes of Giovanni Gerbi and Carlo Durando to win the stage and consolidate his lead in the general classification. The next stage was hotly contested, with the peloton staying together for the whole stage as Carlo Galetti took the stage win.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Although Igor steered well {{clear of}} the Caribbean, large swells of 15–20ft (4.6–6.1m) {{propagated}} from the storm, drowning one person in St. Croix and another in Puerto Rico. Large waves affected the East Coast of the United States, and one person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina. In Bermuda, sustained winds of 91mph (146km/h) and gusts up to 117mph (188km/h) downed trees and power lines, cutting power to approximately 28,000 residents. Rainfall was largely insignificant, peaking at 3.19in (81mm). Impacts near the storm's landfall in Newfoundland were more severe. Rainfall amounts of more than 2in (50mm) were widespread, with a peak of 9.37in (238mm) in St Lawrence; as such, Igor ranks as the third wettest tropical cyclone to impact Atlantic Canada. Run-off from the torrential rainfall damaged or destroyed structures, killed a man when his driveway was washed <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was swept away, and isolated approximately 150 communities. Sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) with gusts to 107mph (172km/h) in Cape Pine downed trees and power lines while damaging or destroying many homes. Approximately 50,000 households lost power during {{the peak of the}} storm. The overall damage total reached $200 million across Newfoundland, making Igor the costliest hurricane on record there. It was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E

5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive and begins a feud with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he {{will not be able to}} handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of the pub.
