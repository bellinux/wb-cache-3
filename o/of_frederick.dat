5|$|After {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>Frederick,</b> the Kingdom was ruled by HenryVII of Germany and ConradIV of Germany. The next {{legitimate}} heir was ConradII, who {{was too young}} at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son <b>of</b> <b>Frederick,</b> took the power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, the Kingdom managed to defend its possessions, but the Papacy declared the Kingdom escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext he came to an agreement with LouisIX, King of France. Louis's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily. In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in the Kingdom, paid {{a portion of the}} papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion and the death of Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.|$|E
