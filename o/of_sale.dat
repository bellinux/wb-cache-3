5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E

40|$|Alfred Chandler, in Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism (1990), {{suggests}} that the acquisition of targets is an alternative to direct investment {{in research and development}} (R&D). Chandler {{suggests that}} the failure of accounting to recognize investment in R&D as an asset may have made R&D less attractive. This study focuses on the relationship between investment in R&D and capital expenditures and a set of partitions based on Chandler's three technology types ("hightech," "stable-tech," and "low-tech") and three possible merger activity classes (acquirer next year, target next year, and neither acquirer nor target next year). Chi-square contingency tables are used to test the independence of merger class and technology type, a frequency test. Regression is used to test the relationship between R&D and sales and between capital expenditures and sales, with the sample partitioned by technology type and by merger class in a 3 -by- 3 research design. The sample is 23, 146 firm years from 1974 - 1988 for 2, 659 firms categorized into industry groups based on Chandler's criteria. The financial data are from COMPUSTAT data files. The frequency of being an acquirer is the same for high-tech and stable-tech firms (11. 2 versus 11. 5 percent of firm years) and higher for low-tech firms (13. 9 percent of firm years). High-tech firms that are acquirers next year have 79 % lower investment in R&D (. 044 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 056 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> and 77 % lower investment in capital expenditures (. 071 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 092 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> than "high-tech" firms that are neither acquirers nor targets next year ("baseline" firms) as measured by the estimated slope coefficient in regression. "Stable-tech" acquirers are similar to "stable-tech" baseline firms in R&D investment (. 016 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 016 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> and in capital expenditures investment (. 072 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus. 080 <b>of</b> <b>sales).</b> "High-tech" targets have higher R&D investment (0. 062 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus 0. 056 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> and lower capital expenditures (0. 054 <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> versus 0. 092 <b>of</b> <b>sales)</b> than "high-tech" baseline firms...|$|R
