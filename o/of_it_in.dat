The degree <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> security <b>in</b> the HEIs is moderately implemented indicating that although this component is in the strategic plan of the HEIs, little or no action has been undertaken in this regard.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the stage <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> adoption <b>in</b> individual European economies, and to analyse the determinants <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> investment <b>in</b> a panel of EU countries.

By clustering the European countries according to their shares <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> spending over GDP, we identify three fairly stable groups of fast, medium and slow adopters. We then build an econometric equation of the determinants <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> investment to be estimated with panel data for five European economies over 1980 - 2001. We consider both aggregate IT investment, and investment in hardware or software taken alone.
