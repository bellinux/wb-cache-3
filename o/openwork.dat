5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of the}} most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive <b>openwork.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{north and}} south sides of the {{quadrangle}} have large arched carriage openings beneath shaped gables; the keystones are carved with horse's heads. The walls within the carriageway opening are decorated with bands of blue brick. The east, {{north and south}} faces are all finished with an <b>openwork</b> brick parapet with a stone coping. The west building has twelve arched openings accessed from the courtyard. The main storeys of the quadrangle mainly have three-light, stone-dressed mullion windows, with two-light windows at the attic level. All the roofs have tall octagonal chimneys and feature decorative ridge tiles. The interior of the stables block was rebuilt during the building's conversion to its present use of laboratories and offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and <b>openwork</b> on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E

25|$|The carving is {{so perfect}} {{that the overall}} {{impression}} is that of <b>openwork</b> lace. The distinctiveness and richness of the church’s decoration evidence the artistic taste and consummate skill of the craftsmen who created it.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{consists of}} five sets of double road wheels with torsion bar springs. The {{system does not}} have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight <b>openwork</b> road wheels were used.|$|E
500|$|Samples {{of ancient}} Baltic mature {{craftsmanship}} (2nd–4th century) {{have been found}} in Żywa Woda and Szwajcaria, both in Suwałki County and in Augustów County among other places. The princely graves as usual also contain many imports from southern and western Europe. Baltic fine bronze ornamental items, such as thin, <b>openworked</b> plates for the attachment of necklaces, were typically coated with colored, often red enamel. Foreign influence can also be seen in the design of clay urns, such as the 3rd or 4th century Greek kernos type vessel with additional miniature urns attached, or the 5th century [...] "window" [...] container with a square opening from Olsztyn County, similar to the urns found in Denmark and northwestern Germany.|$|R
40|$|A segmentation-from-motion {{algorithm}} is presented, {{which is designed}} {{to be part of a}} general object recognition system.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{segmentation}} from motion is presented, {{which is designed}} {{to be part of a}} general object-recognition system. The key idea is to integrate information from Gabor- and Mallat-wavelet transforms of an image sequence to overcome the aperture and the correspondence problem. It is assumed that objects move fronto-parallel. Gabor-wavelet responses allow accurate estimation of image flow vectors with low spatial resolution. A histogram over this image flow field is evaluated and its local maxima provide a set of motion hypotheses. These serve to reduce the correspondence problem occurring in utilizing the Mallat-wavelet transform, which provides the required high spatial resolution in segmentation. Segmentation reliability is improved by integration over time. The system can segment several small, disconnected, and <b>openworked</b> objects, such as dot patterns.

25|$|The outer {{appearance}} of the building is marked by the gradation of its bulks from the heavy bottom part to the <b>openwork</b> top which emphasizes the domination of the vertical in the building’s composition. The architectural peculiarities of {{the composition of the}} bell tower influenced the design of the structures like the two-story sepulchral churches in Yeghvard and Noravank built in Armenia {{in the second quarter of}} the fourteenth century.|$|E
25|$|These {{technologies}} include folding, inserted alloys, and {{differential hardening}} of the edge. While the Japanese {{would be more}} influenced by the Chinese dāo (single-edged swords of various forms), the early Japanese swords known as ken are often based on jian. The Korean version of the jian {{is known as the}} geom or gum, and these swords often preserve features found in Ming-era jian, such as <b>openwork</b> pommels and sharply angled tips.|$|E
25|$|Embroidery {{and other}} {{decorative}} needlework are done {{by women and}} {{are one of the}} most common handcrafts done in the state. These have origins in the pre Hispanic period although various techniques have since been added. Embroidering of blouses and guanengos (Michoacan style huipils) can be done in <b>openwork,</b> straight stitching, cross-stitch and tucks. San Felipe de los Herreros is particularly noted for this work, as well as Zacán Tócuaro, Erongarícuaro, Tarecuato and Angahuan.|$|E
40|$|The final project {{report of}} the <b>opeNWorks</b> {{pathfinder}} project, part of Jisc's open access good practice initiative which ended in July 2016. The project involved the University of Manchester (lead), Edge Hill University, Liverpool John Moores University, the University of Liverpool and the University of Salford. The project aimed to develop a North West community of practice for Open Access Publishing support, building on Manchester’s successful service implementation {{during the first year}} of the UK Research Council’s (RCUK) compliance requirements and block grant funding. Project objectives included developing and adapting guidelines to meet the varying needs of local universities, to reduce the burden of compliance whilst maintaining research excellence. The proximity of the institutions involved was expected to foster community building, and although the project had a regional focus the outputs created were made openly available for reuse by the wider Open Access support community. The project realigned its objectives in 2015 to address two new areas which had emerged from workshops organised by Jisc, whilst continuing to support development of a regional community of Open Access support practice. The new areas were concerned with benchmarking Open Access support services and the ‘approaches to deposit’ that institutions had in place to support the implementation of the Higher Education Funding Council for England’s (HEFCE) new Open Access policy, which affects submissions to the next Research Excellence Framework (REF). The intention was to produce a report that would include examples of Open Access support services, to help institutions considering increasing their resource, and provide a clearer understanding of the costs and benefits of the different deposit workflow models in place to support institutional compliance with HEFCE’s Open Access policy. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{preparation}} {{over the past couple}} of years to put in place processes to enable compliance with the HEFCE REF Open Access policy that came into force on 1 st April 2016. This preparation was itself building on, in many cases, a number of years of Open Access advocacy. Open Access is now better established than it has ever been, particularly within libraries. The further embedding of Open Access within our institutions remains, though, an ongoing task. At this Learning Exchange, those institutions within the Northern Collaboration that have participated in the Jisc Open Access Pathfinder projects over the past two years will share their experience and the findings from this project activity. All the projects have focused in different ways on embedding Open Access within institutional processes and systems. The day will look at embedding from different perspectives: the Open Access lifecycle, APC management, CRIS/repository systems, and general top tips. The exchange is also open to attendees sharing their own practice where this has proved to be effective. Open Access will require local processes, but there is much we can learn from each other to make it the embedded activity we would like it, and need it, to be. Agenda: 10 : 00 – Coffee/tea 10 : 20 – Welcome – The HHuLOA project, to include overview of Pathfinder projects 10 : 30 – Session 1 – The Open Access Lifecycle (including different stakeholder perspectives, link to ERM, link to Jisc Monitor services) - the HHuLOA project 11 : 30 – Session 2 – APC management, experiences and practices - Optimising Resources to Develop a Strategic Approach to Open Access project (Northumbria/Sunderland) / Pathways to Open Access project (UCL/Newcastle/Nottingham) 12 : 30 – Lunch 1 : 15 – Session 3 – 3 short presentations on capturing data for HEFCE (system, metadata, and process) - EPrints / PURE / Hydra (and open to DSpace input from other sites) - to include input from <b>opeNWorks</b> project (Manchester and northwest partners) and End to End Open Access (e 2 eoa) project (Glasgow/Lancaster/Kent/Southampton) 2 : 15 – Session 4 – Making Open Access work across our institutions: Pecha Kucha style good practice sharing with input from the projects and an invitation to attendees to share.

25|$|Islam is famously aniconic, so {{the vast}} {{majority}} of sculpture is arabesque decoration in relief or <b>openwork,</b> based on vegetable motifs, but tending to geometrical abstract forms. In the very early Mshatta Facade (740s), now mostly in Berlin, there are animals within the dense arabesques in high relief, and figures of animals and men in mostly low relief are found in conjunction with decoration on many later pieces in various materials, including metalwork, ivory and ceramics.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{of the region}} tends to be characterised by {{a high degree of}} ornamentation, as seen in the great monuments of Hindu and Buddhist Khmer sculpture (9th to 13th centuries) at Angkor Wat and elsewhere, the enormous 9th-century Buddhist complex at Borobudur in Java, and the Hindu monuments of Bali. Both of these include many reliefs as well as figures in the round; Borobudur has 2,672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statues, many semi-concealed in <b>openwork</b> stupas, and many large guardian figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of a}} fibula {{is known}} as either the bow or the plate, {{depending}} on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or <b>openwork.</b> The body was often decorated. The head {{is the end of}} the fibula with the spring or hinge. The foot {{is the end of the}} fibula where the pin closes. Depending on the type of fibula, and the culture in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing up, down or sideways.|$|E
25|$|Oak Bridge, {{the major}} {{entrance}} to the Ramble from the Upper West Side, spans Bank Rock Bay in the Lake's northwest corner; the long-lost picturesque feature was recreated in 2009 based on Calvert Vaux's original drawings. The bridge, built in 1860 of white oak with decorative <b>openwork</b> panels of cast iron, has been recreated in steel clad in ornamental cast iron facings, with wooden deck and railings. Restoration of further sections of the Lake's shoreline landscapes was undertaken, and the first renovated sections were opened to visitors in April 2008.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the hall was the Waterloo Staircase. It was installed by the 1st Marquess after the battle in 1815. The staircase was situated {{to the right of}} the upper part of the entrance hall. It had 15 carved newel posts which were surmounted by <b>openwork</b> carved oak lanterns and balustrades. The staircase was bought by Edward and Ursula Hayward and removed to Carrick Hill, Australia in 1935, where it was reassembled and is now on public display. Carrick Hill House also has certain fireplace and panelling on display which were once park of Beaudesert.|$|E
25|$|The khachkars {{created by}} the carver Pavgos in Goshavank stand out among the rest. The best {{of them is a}} 1291 khachkar with the maker’s name carved in the bottom left star, {{which is one of the}} most {{intricate}} examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which the basic elements of the composition — a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section—show clearly. The intricate <b>openwork</b> ornaments vary — a clear-cut geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself.|$|E
25|$|Units of the Bundeswehr {{have only}} a single Colour. The Truppenfahne is a square version of the {{national}} flag with the Bundesadler (national shield) overall in the centre. The flag {{is surrounded by a}} black, red, and gold lacework border and edged on three sides by gold fringe. The finial is a gilt bronze <b>openwork</b> spearhead surrounding a black and silver Iron Cross. Below the finial, a streamer is attached with the unit badge at the top and its designation embroidered in gold at the end. These streamers are red for army (Heer) units, blue for the navy (Marine), and white for the air force (Luftwaffe). The streamer is the same length as the hoist of the flag.|$|E
25|$|The {{main accent}} {{of the flat}} facade of the palace is the central loggia adorned with pillars of black marble, which {{correspond}} {{to the first floor}} windows of the great hall. The loggia arcades were crowned with stone cartouches with coats of arms of bishop Zadzik (Korab), Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (White Eagle and Pahonia with Vasa crest) and Cracow chapter (Aaron - Three Crowns), and obelisks. The sides of the rectangular structure were finished with hexagonal towers covered with <b>openwork</b> helmets and connected with the main building by walls topped obelisks, with gates leading to the smaller courtyards. Formerly the walls were also adorned with statues of the Swedish and Muscovy ambassadors. The space under the cornices is decorated with a sgraffito frieze.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a tassel is {{attached}} to the hilt. During the Ming Dynasty these were usually passed through an <b>openwork</b> pommel, and in the Qing {{through a hole in the}} grip itself; modern swords usually attach the tassel to the end of the pommel. Historically these were likely used as lanyards, allowing the wielder to retain the sword in combat. There are some sword forms which utilize the tassel as an integral part of their swordsmanship style (sometimes offensively), while other schools dispense with sword tassels entirely. The movement of the tassel may have served to distract opponents, and some schools further claim that metal wires or thin silk cords were once worked into the tassels for impairing vision and causing bleeding when swept across the face. The tassel's use now is primarily decorative.|$|E
25|$|The maqsura, {{located near}} the minbar, {{consists}} of a fence bounding a private enclosure that allows the sovereign and his senior officials to follow the solemn prayer of Friday without mingling with the faithful. Jewel {{of the art of}} woodwork produced during the reign of the Zirid prince Al-Muizz ibn Badis and dated from {{the first half of the}} eleventh century, it is considered the oldest still in place in the Islamic world. It is a cedar wood fence finely sculpted and carved on three sides with various geometric motifs measuring 2.8 meters tall, eight meters long and six meters wide. Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed <b>openwork</b> merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the <b>openwork</b> hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
25|$|Jehan Gillot {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} of the north aisle and façade in 1493. Because it faces a narrow street and is less ostentatious than its southern counterpart, the north facade has not received as much attention from restorers. It features four and a half bays, one of which contains a portal leading to the interior. The bays are separated by buttresses capped with pinnacles that shoot upward at least an additional story. The width of each bay is devoted to stained glass windows. The design of the Flamboyant tracery is generally uniform throughout, with only a few small deviations between bays. Only the entry portal features a gable, which pierces the balustrade above. The <b>openwork</b> gable is steeply pitched and complements the tracery in the windows below. The original tier of buttresses and their Late Gothic pinnacles can be seen behind the 1493 expansion. Overall, this expansion is harmonious, refined, and simple—adjectives that do not necessarily describe the modifications made to the exterior of the southern half of the church.|$|E
25|$|These {{two parts}} of the church {{represent}} the zenith of the Late Gothic craft of masonry and are perhaps the best examples of the late Flamboyant style in northern France (c. 1480-1525). Its magisterial and arresting visual presence offered visual proof of Louviers’ stability, power, and wealth. Stylistically, the projecting porch and façade created a visual link between Louviers and Rouen, home to very similar Late Gothic monuments and the seat of the powerful archbishop. A veritable lacework of intricately carved stone, the completion of the façade and south porch in 1510 effectively reoriented the entire church. Subsequently, the south porch and portal became the main point of entry and, ultimately, {{the focal point of the}} entire town. Indeed, upon entering Louviers from the south, one witnesses the impressive effect of the alignment of the porch and portal with the “Grand-Rue.” The architecture draws viewers closer, overwhelming them with its visual complexity. Sinuous Flamboyant window tracery, tall ogee gables, an <b>openwork</b> balustrade, spiky pinnacles, and countless sculptures nestled in richly-carved nodding niches give the façade an unmatched quality of richness, visual complexity, and dynamism that was never replicated. Within decades of its completion, the great era of medieval Gothic construction in France drew to a close.|$|E
500|$|San Sebastian Church has two <b>openwork</b> {{towers and}} steel vaulting. From its floor, the basilica's nave rises [...] to the dome, and [...] {{to the tip}} of the twin spires.|$|E
500|$|The Anglican Church of St John The Baptist {{dates from}} the late 14th century. The tower is [...] high, in four-stages with set back offset corner buttresses. It is capped by <b>openwork</b> {{balustrading}} matching the parapets which are from the 19th century. There are two-light late-14th-century windows on all sides at bell-ringing and bell-chamber levels, the latter having fine pierced stonework grilles. There is a stair turret to the north-west corner, with a Weather vane termination. The tower contains two bells dating from 1728 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Chew Stoke. The [...] "Great Bell" [...] was recast from [...] to [...] It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
500|$|Tall Gothic central spires {{remain at}} Salisbury and Norwich, that at Chichester having been rebuilt in the 19th century after its collapse. The spire of Salisbury at [...] is the tallest in Britain. It {{is also the}} tallest 14th-century spire, the tallest ashlar masonry spire (as against the <b>openwork</b> spires of Germany and France), and tallest spire {{in the world that}} remains from the Medieval period that has not been entirely rebuilt. However, it was greatly surpassed in height by the spires of Lincoln and Old St. Paul’s. At Lincoln, between the early 14th century and 1548, the central tower was surmounted by the tallest spire in the world at about 170 metres (557ft) but this fell in a storm. Lichfield Cathedral, uniquely in England, has three medieval masonry spires.|$|E
500|$|For many of {{the pieces}} {{though it is not}} easy to place the date or country of manufacture. [...] There is no such {{difficulty}} with the most famous jewel in the collection, the Lyte Jewel, which was made in London and presented to Thomas Lyte of Lytes Cary, Somerset in 1610 by King James I of England, who loved large jewels, and giving them to others. Lyte was not a regular at court, but he had drawn up a family tree tracing James's descent back to the legendary Trojan, Brut. The jewel contains a miniature portrait of the king by Nicholas Hilliard, though for conservation reasons this is now removed from the jewel. Lyte wears the jewel in a portrait of 1611, showing a drop below the main oval set with three diamonds, which had gone before 1882. [...] The front cover has an elaborate <b>openwork</b> design with James's monogram IR, while the back has very finely executed enamel decoration.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1686 to 1712) is {{reported}} to have spent £1,000 during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, particularly in the chancel (at the east end), but also including the addition of a screen separating {{the main part of the}} chapel from the ante-chapel (at the west end) in 1693. The screen bears the coat of arms of Sir Leoline Jenkins (principal 1661–1673) and, until 1899, also bore Thelwall's coat of arms. His arms were moved to a position above the door (where, says one writer, [...] "they can scarcely be seen") when an organ by J. J. Binns was installed in the ante-chapel in 1899. The current organ, by William Drake, was installed in 1994 to replace the Binns organ. The screen has open ovals rather than blank ovals– an example, said Pevsner, of [...] "the importance given to <b>openwork</b> carving" [...] in the later 17th century. After the installation of the screen, little changed in the chapel until the middle of the 19th century, save for some donations of items such as a brass desk and two silver candlesticks.|$|E
500|$|Key {{examples}} of native craftsmanship on items include the Bute mazer, the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple-wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320. The Savernake Horn was probably {{made for the}} earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century. A few significant reliquaries survive from West Scotland, {{examples of}} the habit of the Celtic church of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as relics. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its [...] "Coigreach" [...] or reliquary, between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the Guthrie Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century. The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved walrus ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of <b>openwork</b> vegetation. It {{is thought to be}} Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.|$|E
