5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf. After reiterating Taylor's legal {{claim to the}} office of governor, he answered the question of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction.

Following Bradley's argument, the court recessed until May 14, 1900.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} dogfight, Boelcke and Böhme, unaware of each other's presence, {{closed in on}} the same aircraft, flown by Captain Arthur Knight. Von Richthofen dived in on the flight path <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> same aircraft; he was chasing the other DH.2, piloted by Lieutenant Alfred Edwin McKay. Boelcke swerved to avoid a {{collision}} with the interceding aircraft. Böhme's landing gear brushed Boelcke's upper wing. As the fabric peeled off the upper wing of his aircraft, Boelcke struggled for control. He and his aircraft fell out of sight into a cloud. When it emerged, the top wing was gone. However, Boelcke made a relatively soft crash-landing. The impact seemed survivable. However, his lap belt did not restrain him, and he never wore a helmet when he flew.|$|E
25|$|Kirsten {{held the}} South African records for most runs and centuries in a Test career, before both were surpassed by Jacques Kallis. He {{was the first}} Test batsman to make {{hundreds}} against {{each of the other}} 9 Test nations. He scored 275 runs against England as a result of batting for over 14 and a half hours as South Africa followed on at Kingsmead in Durban, it still stands as the second-longest innings (in terms of duration) in Test history. The high score was later surpassed by Graeme Smith when he made 277 against England in 2003. He still holds the record for highest innings by a South African in a One Day International; 188 not-out made against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 World Cup, which is the tenth highest innings of all time in One Day International cricket, and the highest score in World Cup cricket history. This record stood until it was surpassed by Chris Gayle who scored 215 against Zimbabwe in 2015. Later, that record was surpassed by Martin Guptill who scored 237* against the West Indies in the quarter finals <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> World Cup.|$|E

[...] In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned {{a study of the}} show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board. Tomlinson said that the study supported what he characterized as [...] "the image of the left-wing bias of NOW". George Neumayr, the executive editor of The American Spectator, a conservative magazine, told the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that [...] "PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> strident, left-wing bias... uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whereas both Marxist–Leninist {{and social}} {{democratic}} orthodox thinkers viewed Marxism {{as a new}} kind of positive science, Frankfurt School theorists such as Horkheimer instead based their work on the epistemological base of Marx's work, which presented itself as critique, as in Marx's [...] They thus emphasized that Marx attempted to create {{a new kind of}} critical analysis oriented toward the unity of theory and revolutionary practice rather than a new kind of positive science. Critique, in this Marxian sense, means taking the ideology of a society (for example, the belief in individual freedom or free market capitalism) and critiquing it by comparing it with a posited social reality <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> society (for example, social inequality and exploitation).

2500|$|In 1972, Bolland {{attended}} the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met [...] "a {{lot of the}} people who were key in the comics scene of the time," [...] including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that."

2500|$|West's {{parents had}} her baptised into the Church of England {{two months after}} birth and she {{considered}} herself a Christian, though an unconventional believer. At times, she found God to be wicked; at other times she considered Him merely ineffectual and defeated. However, she revered Christ as the quintessentially good man, she had great respect for the literary, pictorial, and architectural manifestations of the Christian ethos, and she considered faith a valid tool {{to grapple with the}} conundrums of life and the mysteries of the cosmos. Although her writings are full of references to the Bible and ecclesiastical history, she was essentially anti-doctrinaire and occasionally blasphemous. In 1926 she expressed the unorthodox belief that [...] "Christianity must be regarded not as a final revelation but as a phase of revelation." [...] Moreover, she rejected specific articles of belief such as the virgin birth, Original sin, the Atonement, and Providence. Her contribution to Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Letters Series, Letter to a Grandfather (1933), is a declaration of [...] "my faith, which seems to some unfaith" [...] disguised as philosophical fiction. Written {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, Letter to a Grandfather traces the progressive degeneration of the notion of Providence through the ages, concluding skeptically that [...] "the redemptive power of divine grace no longer seemed credible, nor very respectable in the arbitrary performance that was claimed for it." [...] As for the Atonement, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is in part meant as a refutation <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> doctrine, which she saw as having sparked a fatal obsession with sacrifice throughout the Christian era and, specifically, as having prompted Neville Chamberlain to formulate his policy of appeasement, which she vehemently opposed. She wrote:"All our Western thought is founded on this repulsive pretence that pain is the proper price of any good thing... developed a theory of the Atonement which was pure nonsense, yet had the power to convince... This monstrous theory supposes that God was angry with man for his sins and that He wanted to punish him for these, not in any way that might lead to his reformation, but simply by inflicting pain on him; and that He allowed Christ to suffer this pain instead of man and thereafter was willing on certain terms to treat man as if he had not committed these sins. This theory flouts reason at all points, for it is not possible that a just God should forgive people who are wicked because another person who was good endured agony by being nailed to a cross." ...|$|E
