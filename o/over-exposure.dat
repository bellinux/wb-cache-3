Background Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an occupational illness caused by chronic exposure to excessive sound levels. For underground coal mine workers, NIHL {{continues to be}} a serious health issue. Analysis of hearing loss data suggests that by retirement age, 70 %- 90 % of U. S. coal mine workers will have a hearing impairment. Operated in the confined spaces of underground mines, large industrial mining equipment often produces sound levels that can be harmful to workers. Of all equipment used in underground coal mining operations, CMMs account for the most noise overexposures. To reduce the occurrence of noise <b>over-exposures,</b> engineering noise controls must be developed for the CMM...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the country {{experienced}} unprecedented economic growth fuelled by a dramatic rise in consumer spending, construction and investment, which {{became known as the}} Celtic Tiger period. The pace of growth slowed during 2007 and led to the burst of a major property bubble which had developed over time. The dramatic fall in property prices highlighted the <b>over-exposure</b> of the economy to construction and contributed to the Irish banking crisis. Ireland officially entered a recession in 2008 following consecutive months of economic contraction. GNP contracted by 11.3% in 2009 alone, the largest annual decline in GNP since 1950.|$|E
40|$|There are {{moves to}} limit by {{legislation}} {{the amount of}} electric and magnetic fields that workers {{and the general public}} are exposed to. In work locations near wiring, cables & equipment carrying high electric currents, there are situations in which the proposed magnetic field limits could be exceeded. Since the limits for the general public are more conservative than those for workers and since the foetus or a pregnant worker should be afforded the status of a member of the general public, it is important to assess a worst-case scenario for the purposes of a general code of practice. Three different magnetic field exposures are modelled, which include the worst case - the body of a pregnant woman at a smallest distance of 30 cm to the conductor. All computations were done by using Multiple Multipole Program (MMP), which is based on the Generalized Multipole Technique (GMT) from ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Zurich, Switzerland. In a worst-case scenario the proposed basic restrictions would be exceeded slightly in both maternal and foetal tissue.

40|$|Most {{imbalances}} of trace-element nutrition {{are characterized by}} the absence of acute, easily recog-nizable disease. To diagnose marginal deficiencies or excesses of trace elements, the analyst must use rath-er sophisticated procedures, and even where an im-balance of trace-element nutrition can be proven, the implications for health are not always evident. Previ-ous attempts to connect deviations of trace-element nutrition with health and disease have suffered from conspicuous gaps in our knowledge; etiologic factors for many chronic disease processes are unknown, with the result that existing hypotheses can be one-sided. In addition, the biological roles of many trace elements are hypothetical, at best. Whereas the short-term consequences of extreme under- or <b>over-exposures</b> are reasonably well-known, it is very diffi-cult to investigate the marginal imbalances and their long-term consequences that are most likely related to existing health problems in man. The rapid development of analytical methodology in the past decade has created a powerful tool for trace-element research. However, these tools can be dangerous if their technical and general limitations are not clearly understood. It is necessary to appreci-ate these limitations, not only in technology but also with regard to the interpretation of the results, in view of the ever-increasing demands on the analytical chemist. These demands are created by the discover...|$|R
40|$|Health {{surveillance}} efforts {{indicate that}} the development of lung disease and overexposure to respirable dust in underground coal mires continues to afflict mine worker. Results from the most recent round (1992 - 1996) of the Coal Worker's X-ray Surveillance Programs indicate that approximately 8 % of the examined miners who had at least 25 years of mining experience were diagnosed with Coal Worker Pneumoconiosis (CWP) (category 1 / 0 +). During the period between 1995 - 1999, mine operators and MSHA inspectors collected 9968 and 1365 dust samples respectively, from longwall designated occupation (DO) personnel. Analysis of these samples showed that 1970 (20 %) of the mine operator samples and 25. 8 (19 %) of the MSHA samples 5 exceeded the 2 mg/m 3 dust standard. The continued development of CWP in coal mine workers and the magnitude of respirable dust <b>over-exposures</b> in longwall mining occupations illustrate the need for improved dust control technology on longwalls. Figure 1 illustrates the major longwall dust sources as determined in the early 1990 's. 4 This article describes the ongoing research to find ways to minimise shearer dust levels as a function of changes in dust control parameters, and research to determine the impact of high air velocities on shield dust entrainment...|$|R

However, DEHP is coming under increasing pressure in Europe. The assessment of potential risks related to phthalates, {{and in particular the}} use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a specific labeling requirement was introduced across the EU for all devices containing phthalates that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction). The label aims to enable healthcare professionals to use this equipment safely, and, where needed, take appropriate precautionary measures for patients at risk of <b>over-exposure.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{the filmmakers}} were {{dissatisfied}} with the initial drafts of episodes, specifically with the evolution of characters, they would rewrite events, or add scenes to re-establish the original vision. The character of Earl Jenkins (Tony Todd), {{intended to be a}} sympathetic villain, came across as [...] "completely unlikable" [...] in the original draft of [...] "Jitters". The character suffers from <b>over-exposure</b> to kryptonite, causing massive seizures; if Jenkins happened to grab someone, they could be shaken to death. Originally, the character is first seen banging on the door of LuthorCorp and killing a security guard during one of his seizures. To present a more favorable aspect to the audience, a scene in which Earl visits his infant child was added to show that he was not a [...] "raving maniac". Similar rewrites occurred with the characters Ryan James (Ryan Kelley) in [...] "Stray" [...] and Tyler Randall (Reynaldo Rosales) in [...] "Reaper". In the original draft of [...] "Stray", Ryan developed his telepathic abilities from exposure to kryptonite.; to emphasize the show was not always about kryptonite-infected villains, the story was revised so that Ryan had his ability from birth. The network also expressed dissatisfaction with Ryan as a murderer, so the character was rewritten to be the [...] "nice kid". The character of Tyler Randall shared Earl Jenkins's issue: he was not sympathetic enough in the filmmakers' eyes; intended to be an escaped prisoner, he was rewritten to be [...] "the world's deadliest nice guy".|$|E

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: Radiation {{exposure}} {{from medical}} imaging has received increasing attention in recent years. Ongoing calls to report radiation doses received during radiology studies {{as a means}} of recording cumulative exposure and identifying rare <b>over-exposures</b> have culminated in the State of California passing a mandatory reporting requirement effective July 1, 2012. Herein we describe a radiology housestaff-led quality improvement project to track radiation dose reporting a full year prior to state reporting mandates using a template-driven reporting system and our results over the first 12 months of its implementation. Materials and Methods: Effective July 2011, all radiology trainees were instructed to use a standard computed tomography (CT) report template that included a CT dose measurement derived from dose information routinely displayed on our picture archiving and communication system. Consecutive reports from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012, of patients who underwent CT examinations at our institution were then retrospectively reviewed. Compliance of each study with the reporting requirement was assessed based on {{the presence or absence of}} a radiation dose statement within the finalized report. Results: A total of 36, 217 eligible consecutive CT reports were identified within the review period. Of these, 91. 9 % reported the radiation dose for the examination, greatly exceeding the initial goal of 80 % compliance with the dose reporting requirement. Conclusion: Successful reporting of CT radiation doses resulted from template-driven reporting, readily accessible calculation tools to facilitate dose calculation, and minimization of reporting burden on the radiologist a full year prior to state regulatory mandates. © 2013...|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{study was conducted}} in 55 subjects (mean age: 41) in hospitals to determine the prevalence of lens opacities and cataracts in workers exposed to ethylene oxide in six sterilisation units. The 21 exposed subjects over 45 were then compared with 16 non-exposed subjects, matched for age and sex. The relation between occupational exposure to ethylene oxide and white blood cell concentrations was also investigated. Lens opacities (independently of visual acuity) were observed in 19 of the 55 exposed. Among both exposed and non-exposed aged over 45, {{there were no significant differences}} with regard to the characteristics of lens opacities [...] prevalence (19 in the 21 exposed; 10 in the 16 non-exposed), distribution of the location, and importance and type (opalescence or discontinuous opacities). No link was found between the characteristics of the lens opacities and the characteristics of exposure: habitual exposure, measured between 0. 06 and 39 ppm (cumulated in ppm-number of weekly hours-years) and accidental <b>over-exposures</b> (regular and irregular). For cataracts, defined by the association of lens opacities and a visual acuity less than 20 / 25 (this loss not being attributable to another cause), their prevalence differed significantly (p less than 0. 05) between the exposed (six of 21) and the non-exposed (0 of 16); there was no relation between their existence and overexposures (the analysis for habitual exposure was not possible because of the small size of the sample). The risk of lens opacifications by ethylene oxide in cases of massive exposures as previously described could also exist during chronic exposure to low concentrations. It could be explained by saturation of protective mechanisms against alkylating action of this product. Linear relations were found between the logarithms of blood concentrations of polymorphoneutrophils (R=- 0. 54; p< 0. 005) and of lymphocytes (R=- 0. 45;p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|For {{half of the}} 30 -odd {{years that}} diacetyl-exposed workers have {{developed}} disabling lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis was unrecognized as an occupational risk. Delays in its recognition as an occupational lung disease are attributable {{to the absence of}} a work-related temporal pattern of symptoms; failure to recognize clusters of cases; complexity of exposure environments; and absence of epidemiologic characterization of workforces giving rise to case clusters. Few physicians are familiar with this rare disease, and motivation to investigate the unknown requires familiarity with what is known and what is anomalous. In pursuit of the previously undescribed risk, investigators benefited greatly from multi-disciplinary collaboration, in this case including physicians, epidemiologists, environmental scientists, toxicologists, industry representatives, and worker advocates. In the 15 years since obliterative bronchiolitis was described in microwave popcorn workers, 1 -dicarbonyl-related lung disease has been found in flavoring manufacturing workers, other food production workers, diacetyl manufacturing workers, and coffee production workers, alongside case reports in other industries. Within the field of occupational health, impacts include new ventures in public health surveillance, attention to spirometry quality for serial measurements, identifying other indolent causes of obliterative bronchiolitis apart from accidental <b>over-exposures,</b> and broadening the spectrum of diagnostic abnormalities in the disease. Within toxicology, impacts include new attention to appropriate animal models of obliterative bronchiolitis, pertinence of computational fluid dynamic-physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, and contributions to mechanistic understanding of respiratory epithelial necrosis, airway fibrosis, and central nervous system effects. In these continuing efforts, collaboration between laboratory scientists, clinicians, occupational public health practitioners in government and industry, and employers remains critical for improving the health of workers inhaling volatile 1 -dicarbonyl compounds.

Money became available to establish the Crocker Laboratory for Medical Research, with a 60-inch cyclotron, capable of producing neutrons for Stone to pursue the treatment of malignant disease. Stone was allotted cyclotron time one afternoon each week for the treatment of patients. He was ahead of his time in the experimental treatment of tumors. This work was suspended by World War II, and Dr. Stone became responsible for {{the health and safety of}} the workers of the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. The Met Lab was doing initial research on the metabolism of fission and fissionable products in collaboration with the Crocker Radiation Laboratory and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and others. Stone's talents as physician and administrator became apparent since there were little or no <b>over-exposures</b> or radiation injuries, with numerous research and ancillary personnel involved in developing the techniques and procedures of the atomic age.|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Background: The {{transition}} to digital radiology {{is a very}} natural and slow process driven by internal and environmental forces, like mobile phone, personal computer, DVD and satellite tech-nology. Radiology as a high technical supporting ser-vice in the hospital is changing by new imaging mo-dalities and the surrounding informatics. Nowadays all CT, ultrasound and MRI equipment is digital and forces radiologists to live with digital images. Even the policy-makers in healthcare see that the success-ful way to organize healthcare and certainly screen-ing programs is along informatics. Patients draw also benefits from digital images, as {{the quality of care}} improves. What is the right attitude of a radiologist in this evolution; is this a threat or an opportunity? What steps and decisions have to be made? One has to consider that this evolution to digital is unavoid-able and a way of no return, so it is better to join carefully and to invest in a progressive and clever way. Of course there are several manners to arrive at the digital radiology depending on your needs and the situation where you live. Full digital radiology requires some infrastructures like communication networks (telephone, fiber-optics, and satellite), the availability of digital modalities and detectors, local networks, digital archives, displays. Most of the nec-essary components are available on the market, but are still expensive (like high-resolution displays, digi-tal archives, and solid state detectors). Other invest-ments (like telecommunication) {{are in the hands of}} the government. Historically most of PACS (Picture Archiving & Communications Systems) are grown around a hardcopy network for CT, MRI and Ultra-sound, sharing a high throughput, high quality wet or dry laser printer. Other digital radiology solutions stem from HIS (Hospital Information Systems) or CIS (Clinical Information Systems) linked by a typical RIS (Radiological Information Systems). There are steps to take for a cost-efficient transition, add digital mo-dalities (CR and DR) and RIS (with work lists) and improve image quality, get lower dose and optimal workflow; switch to diagnostic workstations (high quality), archiving system which allows integration of modalities and full access to the patient’s history, and is necessary to construct a digital archive, but with difficult economical justification; introduce clinical workstations to display/access images and pa-tient information across the hospital and even abroad and start the EPR (Electronic Patient Record) as component of the Hospital Information System (HIS). The film-less era starts here: Telemedicine and Tel-eradiology are derivates of the existing digital radiol-ogy. Selection of digital x-ray systems is critical because of the cost. Computed Radiography (CR) is the most fa-vourable technology in “low labour cost” countries because it does not need replacement of x-ray rooms, serves several rooms and offers an excellent image quality through processing at lower dose (400 - 600 ISO speed). Repeat rates for under and <b>over-exposures</b> are very low (< 1 %) as CR is a fault tolerant and robust technology even with old x-ray equip-ment. CR fits all applications from emergency, inten-sive care up to mammography and radiotherapy without changes to exposure techniques. Adding PACS and RIS to digital detectors has to be imple-mented in open and standardized way in order to protect your investments for future expansion to-wards a complete digital environment. Selection of vendors with a far-ahead and proven roadmap is es-sential to make digital radiology successful...|$|R
