5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy, more training was given to ship's crews in aircraft recognition; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes. Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft's bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.|$|E

He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting.

40|$|Local {{preconditioning}} for Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid flow calculations with variable {{gas density}} is investigated. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> simultaneous solution algorithms for low-Mach calculations is {{strongly related to}} preconditioning. The gas-solid drag source terms are at <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> a solid volume fraction and frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound [1]. Whereas the solid volume fraction dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound is straightforward to account for in the gas-solid preconditioner, {{this is not the}} case with the frequency dependency, the frequency not being an extra calculation variable. The preconditioners used so far in the gas-solid flow literature do not account for or eliminate <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound and transfer the problem to <b>the</b> numerical speed <b>of</b> sound. Not accounting for <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner results, however, in drastic convergence slow down [2, 3], even when a fully implicit treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drag source terms is taken. Possible approaches to account for <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner are investigated. It is shown that the gas-solid preconditioner does not need to remove <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound, but should account for it and be scaled according to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound at <b>the</b> highest frequency calculated, that is <b>the</b> filter frequency <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound, which logically depends on the local mesh resolution. Accounting for <b>the</b> filter frequency <b>mixture</b> speed <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner as good as eliminates <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convergence speed by the gas-solid drag source terms. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> a drag history force to the gas-solid preconditioner to properly rescale frequencies lower than the filter frequency hardly alters the convergence behavior.
