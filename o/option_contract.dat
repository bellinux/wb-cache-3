5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best <b>option,</b> <b>contract</b> placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E

40|$|There exist obvious {{changes in}} price and demand during the inflationary period, {{both of which}} are {{regarded}} as the key factors leading to supply chain uncertainty. In this paper, we focus our discussion on price increase and demand contraction caused by inflation, integrate the effect of inflation and <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> within the model framework, and analyze how to use <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> to achieve supply chain coordination under inflation scenarios. We consider a one-period two-stage supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer and explore the effect of inflation on the optimal ordering and production decisions under three different types of contracts: wholesale price <b>contracts,</b> <b>option</b> <b>contracts,</b> and portfolio contracts. Moreover, we explore the impact of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> on the supply chain through using wholesale price contracts model as the benchmark. We find that the retailer prefers adopting portfolio contracts, but the supplier prefers providing <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> under inflation scenarios. Ultimately, <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> will be implemented owing to the supplier’s market dominant position. In addition, we discuss the supply chain bilateral coordination mechanism with <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> from the perspectives of two members and derive that <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> can coordinate the supply chain and achieve Pareto improvement under inflation scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of the multiperiod {{replenishment}} decisions for the retailer under inflation. In order to manage the risks of price and demand caused by inflation, the retailer has an opportunity to order products and purchase options from the supplier in each period. We formulate the multiperiod inventory model for the retailer with <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> and then derive his myopic ordering policy in each period and his myopic expected total discounted profit over the entire time horizon. By taking the case without <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> as a benchmark, we explore the effect of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> on the retailer’s decisions and performance under inflation. We find that the application of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> might induce the retailer to reduce the firm order and increase the total order in each period under inflation. We also find that the application of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> might benefit the retailer under inflation...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} written records of futures trading is in Aristotle's Politics. [...] He {{tells the story of}} Thales, a poor philosopher from Miletus who developed a [...] "financial device, which involves a principle of universal application". [...] Thales used his skill in forecasting and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn. Confident in his prediction, he made agreements with local olive-press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their olive presses when the harvest was ready. Thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or pathetic and because the olive-press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of a poor yield. When the harvest-time came, and a sharp increase in demand {{for the use of the}} olive presses outstripped supply (availability of the presses), he sold his future use contracts of the olive presses at a rate of his choosing, and made a large quantity of money. It should be noted, however, that this is a very loose example of futures trading and, in fact, more closely resembles an <b>option</b> <b>contract,</b> given that Thales was not obliged to use the olive presses if the yield was poor.|$|E

[...] Essentially, once a promisee begins performance, an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> is implicitly created between the promisor and the promisee.

The consideration for this <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration {{is provided by the}} promisee's beginning of performance.|$|E

Through using the model of wholesale price contracts as the benchmark, we find that the introduction of bidirectional <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> can benefit both the supplier and the retailer under inflation scenarios. Based on the conclusions drawn above, we design the bilateral coordination mechanism from the different perspective of two members involved and discuss how bidirectional <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> should be set to achieve channel coordination under inflation scenarios.
