5|$|In April 1997, Harper {{suggested}} that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and ignoring the principles of economic conservatism.

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> {{maneuvers}} {{would be}} required with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|The success {{led to a}} {{much more}} ambitious {{offensive}} operation named Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star) {{less than two weeks}} later. That operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, lifting the siege altogether, but it achieved only minimal progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and completely lift the siege, but made <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> gains in each one. The corridor remained in range of German artillery and the siege was only over on January 27, 1944.|$|E

5|$|Two essays written {{during this}} time {{foreshadow}} Smuts's later views, both political and philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, {{an examination of the}} economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{was born}} about 1748 in Moneymore, County Londonderry, Ireland (present-day Northern Ireland), {{the son of}} Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell. He studied at the Irish College in Paris and was ordained to the priesthood there in November 1776. Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a {{reputation}} as a preacher of <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> ability. Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there. He was appointed parish priest of Dungannon in 1792 or 1793 and Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Armagh in 1794. After the death of Archbishop Richard O'Reilly in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England {{again at the}} start of 1153 with a small army, supported in the north and east of England by Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod. Stephen's castle at Malmesbury was besieged by Henry's forces, and the King responded by marching west with an army to relieve it. Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to force Henry's smaller army to fight a decisive battle along the river Avon. In the face of the increasingly wintry weather, Stephen agreed to a temporary truce and {{returned to}} London, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the Angevin cause. Despite <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England.|$|E

5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
5|$|The VRS and JNA {{attacked}} {{north of}} Ston on 11 April, pushing back {{elements of the}} HV 115th Infantry Brigade and elements of the arriving HV Guards Brigades for <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> territorial gain. The frontline stabilized by 23 April and the HV counterattacked and reclaimed some ground after 27 April. On 17 May, Bobetko ordered a major attack of the two full guards brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelješac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrovačko Primorje by advancing along {{the rim of the}} Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle.|$|E

5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Patricia was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere and the second-most intense worldwide in terms of barometric pressure. It also featured the highest one-minute maximum sustained winds ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec in mid-October2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October20. Initial development was slow, with <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> strengthening within {{the first day of}} its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category5 hurricane in just 24hours—a near-record pace. The magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both forecast models and meteorologists suffered from record-high prediction errors.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Patricia was the second-most intense {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide, behind Typhoon Tip in 1979, {{with a minimum}} atmospheric pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg). Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October20. Initial development was slow, with <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> strengthening within {{the first day of}} its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category5 hurricane in just 24hours—a near-record pace. On October23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h). This made it the most intense {{tropical cyclone}} on record in the Western Hemisphere, and the strongest globally in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained winds.|$|E

5|$|Roughly 18hours {{after being}} {{classified}} a depression, deep convection {{wrapped around the}} center of the system, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm, and to give it the name Celia. Satellite overpasses of the storm revealed that Celia had already begun developing an eye-like feature at the surface, an indication that rapid intensification may ensue. The storm tracked relatively slowly towards the west-southwest in response to a mid-level ridge to the north. By the evening of June19, Celia displayed a well-organized structure with an eye beginning to appear within the storm's central dense overcast. Due to the presence of easterly wind shear, intensification was briefly stalled for several hours; however, at 1800UTC on June20, the NHC upgraded Celia to a minimal hurricane as it attained winds of 75mph (120km/h). An intermittent eye was seen on visible satellite image throughout the day, but it failed to fully consolidate by the afternoon of June21, by which time the system appeared to be vertically tilted, having the low-level circulation displaced to the northeast of the mid-level circulation. <b>Only</b> <b>modest</b> strengthening took place during this time as the system's outflow was being restricted by continuing easterly shear.|$|E
5|$|The new Edward IV {{visited the}} castle {{regularly}} {{and established a}} council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> work on the property, although he may could {{have been responsible for}} the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his own childhood experiences at Ludlow, Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now Ludlow had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and their claim to the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use Ludlow Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.|$|E
5|$|To draw Stephen's forces {{away from}} Wallingford, Henry besieged Stephen's castle at Malmesbury, and the King responded by marching west with an army to relieve it.

In {{the face of}} the increasingly wintry weather, the two men agreed to a temporary truce, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands, where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the cause. Henry was then free to turn his forces south against the besiegers at Wallingford. Despite <b>only</b> <b>modest</b> military successes, he and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England.
