5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately <b>oxidized</b> histones. <b>Oxidized</b> proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly <b>oxidized</b> aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the chemical causing bluing upon tissue injury was reported in 1973. The molecule, gyrocyanin, is a highly <b>oxidized</b> bis-phenol-substituted cyclopentenone that develops a blue color when it is <b>oxidized.</b> In contrast, the bluing of other boletes {{has been attributed to}} the oxidation of variegatic or xerocomic acid. Gyrocyanin is biosynthesized from intermediates supplied by the shikimate pathway, a metabolic route used by fungi for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.|$|E

5000|$|Substances {{that have}} the ability to <b>oxidize</b> other {{substances}} (cause them to lose electrons) are said to be oxidative or <b>oxidizing</b> and are known as <b>oxidizing</b> agents, oxidants, or oxidizers. That is, the oxidant (<b>oxidizing</b> agent) removes electrons from another substance, and is thus itself reduced. And, because it [...] "accepts" [...] electrons, the <b>oxidizing</b> agent is also called an electron acceptor. Oxygen is the quintessential oxidizer.|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, an <b>oxidizing</b> agent (oxidant, oxidizer) is a {{substance}} that {{has the ability to}} <b>oxidize</b> other substances (cause them to lose electrons). Common <b>oxidizing</b> agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the halogens.|$|R
5|$|Although E°(Md4+→Md3+) was {{predicted}} in 1975 to be +5.4V, suggesting that mendelevium(III) {{could be easily}} <b>oxidized</b> to mendelevium(IV), 1967 experiments with the strong oxidizing agent sodium bismuthate were unable to oxidize mendelevium(III) to mendelevium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be <b>oxidized</b> to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be <b>oxidized</b> to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly <b>oxidized.</b>|$|E

5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} {{are less}} stable than iron(III) complexes but {{the preference for}} O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They {{have a tendency to}} be <b>oxidized</b> to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced species (often an anion) {{with a more}} {{positive}} cell potential {{are more difficult to}} <b>oxidize</b> than reduced species with a more negative cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to <b>oxidize</b> sulfate anions than it is to <b>oxidize</b> bromide anions.|$|R
50|$|An <b>oxidizing</b> acid is a Brønsted acid that is {{a strong}} <b>oxidizing</b> agent.

40|$|Effects of {{the amino}} acid analog D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine on auxin <b>oxidizing</b> {{activity}} from Avena saliva cv. Clintford have been examined. Incubation of etiolated Avena coleoptile apices with D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine, previously reported to promote elongation and depress phenolic metabolism, lowers auxin <b>oxidizing</b> activity. Temperature and pH profiles demonstrated that depression of <b>oxidizing</b> activity by D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine occurs over a relatively wide range. Incubation of coleoptiles in media containing L-phenylalanine alone or L-phenylalanine combined with D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine result in <b>oxidizing</b> activities which are, respectively, {{slightly higher than}} or restored to control levels. Thus, dark incubation of coleoptiles with D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine results in auxin <b>oxidizing</b> activity which {{differs from that of}} control and other treatment groups. <b>Oxidizing</b> activity from D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine pretreated coleoptiles has a Michaelis constant (70 µM) and a maximum velocity (0. 200) which are consistently lower than the control constants. These findings provide further clarification of the effects of D,L-p-fluorophenylalanine, on coleoptile elongation and auxin <b>oxidizing</b> activity in etiolated Avena coleoptiles...|$|R

5|$|The redox {{reactions}} catalyzed by oxidoreductases {{are vital}} {{in all parts}} of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are <b>oxidized,</b> thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then <b>oxidized</b> in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{thioredoxin}} system {{contains the}} 12-kDa protein thioredoxin and its companion thioredoxin reductase. Proteins related to thioredoxin {{are present in}} all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an <b>oxidized</b> disulfide form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being <b>oxidized,</b> the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes <b>oxidized</b> back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 <b>oxidized</b> on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E
