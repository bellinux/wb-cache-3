5|$|Ehlers {{directly}} addressed physics teachers, {{in talks}} and journal {{articles on the}} teaching <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> and related basic ideas, such as mathematics as the language of physics.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{streamlined}} axiom system <b>of</b> special <b>relativity</b> in firs-order logic. From this axiom system we ``derive'' an axiom system <b>of</b> general <b>relativity</b> in two natural steps. We will also {{see how the}} axioms <b>of</b> special <b>relativity</b> transform into those <b>of</b> general <b>relativity.</b> This way we hope to make general relativity more accessible for the non-specialist...|$|R
50|$|This is not surprising, as in {{both cases}} the goal is to find laws {{satisfying}} transformation laws including one parameter that is relative: the speed in the case <b>of</b> the <b>relativity</b> <b>of</b> movement; the resolution in the case <b>of</b> the <b>relativity</b> <b>of</b> scales.|$|R
50|$|The theory <b>of</b> scale <b>relativity</b> {{follows a}} similar {{construction}} {{as the one}} <b>of</b> the <b>relativity</b> <b>of</b> movement, {{which took place in}} three steps: galilean, special and general relativity.|$|R
5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> as a basis he derived the special theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|He {{articulated}} the principle <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are {{the principle of}} equivalence, general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{was still}} eight {{years away from}} {{completing}} the general theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> Nonetheless, {{he was able to}} make a number of novel, testable predictions that were based on his starting point for developing his new theory: the equivalence principle.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> in 1905, Einstein {{started thinking about}} how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the theory <b>of</b> True <b>Relativity</b> to view quantum Space-Time using simple {{geometry}} and represents a paradigm shift in the way we view Time and Space. The ideal gas law and the math <b>of</b> True <b>Relativity</b> are used to model the moments before the Big Bang and the extreme expansion of Space-Time in the initial moments after the Big Bang. Both are displayed using graphs and time lines from the data supplied from the math <b>of</b> True <b>Relativity.</b> Answers to the Olber’s paradox and the horizon problem are shown to be a natural consequence <b>of</b> True <b>Relativity...</b>|$|R
25|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is restricted}} to flat spacetime, i.e., to all phenomena without significant influence of gravitation. The latter lies in the domain <b>of</b> general <b>relativity</b> and the corresponding tests <b>of</b> general <b>relativity</b> must be considered.|$|R
5000|$|The Lie algebra [...] {{is central}} to the study <b>of</b> special <b>{{relativity}},</b> general relativity and supersymmetry: its fundamental representation is the so-called spinor representation, while its adjoint representation generates the Lorentz group SO(3,1) <b>of</b> special <b>relativity.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's general theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity {{is viewed as a}} consequence of the geometry of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{elementary}} {{objects of}} geometry –points, lines, triangles– are traditionally defined in three-dimensional space or on two-dimensional surfaces. In 1907, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics {{professor at the}} Swiss Federal Polytechnic, introduced a geometric formulation of Einstein's special theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> where the geometry included not only space but also time. The basic entity of this new geometry is four-dimensional spacetime. The orbits of moving bodies are curves in spacetime; the orbits of bodies moving at constant speed without changing direction correspond to straight lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
