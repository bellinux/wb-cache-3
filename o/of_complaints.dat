The greatest number <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes.

In this study, the students use Indirect Accusation when the complainee has higher social status. Moreover, when the complainee has equal social status they tend to use Direct Accusation as the major strategy. For the next researchers, the writer suggest them use another approach in order to analyze speech act <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> and better to compare the study <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> between native speaker of English and EFL Learners...|$|R
