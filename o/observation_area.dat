5|$|An {{economic}} {{boom in the}} south {{following the end of}} World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison {{spent a good deal of}} time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and <b>observation</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in {{the vestibule}} end and separate men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Observation</b> <b>areas</b> {{were made}} by the Kumeyaay to watch and {{register}} astronomical events. However many were destroyed by vandals before protection measures were instituted.|$|R

5|$|With {{extensive}} sand beaches, seabird breeding areas, {{and good}} dive {{sites in the}} Reef <b>Observation</b> <b>Area</b> {{to the south of}} the island, North Island is considered an attractive tourist site. However, all of the island's limited anchorage and jetty space is occupied by commercial fishers, so landings from private or charter boats are possible only by prior arrangement. Moreover, visitors are not permitted to camp on the island. North Island accounts for about 3.5% of private recreational boat trips to the Houtman Abrolhos and about 1% of commercial charter boat trips. The most recent tourism plan for the Houtman Abrolhos supports the continued use of North Island by private charter boats {{and the use of the}} airstrip for tourism purposes, but recommends against the establishment of a land-based tourist site there.|$|E
25|$|The {{visitor center}} has a 60-seat {{auditorium}} {{as well as}} an indoor bird <b>observation</b> <b>area.</b> Nine public fishing areas are open throughout the refuge.

25|$|On March 24, 2011, {{around one}} hundred {{visitors}} were {{stranded in the}} <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> for 45 minutes after {{the doors of the}} south tram refused to close. The tourists were safely brought down the arch in the north tram, which had been closed that week so officials could upgrade it with a new electronic transportation system. The National Park Service later attributed the malfunction to a computer glitch associated with the new system, which had already been implemented with the south tram. No one was hurt in the occurrence, but the arch suffered a slight loss in spring break tourism revenue.|$|E
25|$|Promenade Deck started {{forward with}} a first class <b>observation</b> <b>area,</b> then number three-like encompassing, {{continuing}} aft through narrow links to the glass-enveloped first class promenade. Inwardly, it started with the phenomenal social hall with its curved panorama of windows and an aft bulkhead that held sculptures and reliefs in bronze by Mascherini. In this sheered salon, the ceiling accommodated an oval recess in which the lighting was designed in a zodiac fashion. This room was converted into an auditorium in 1964. The only part of this social hall to be carried over into the auditorium was an oval ceiling recess constellation-like lighting arrangement.|$|E

25|$|The Lupu Bridge {{used to be}} {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} along the Huangpu River. The bridge itself was actually also an attraction, as tourists could have ascended to the observation deck {{at the top of the}} bridge. The attraction was known as Shanghai Climb, and involved riding a high-speed elevator from the base of the bridge, and then climbing 367 steps at high altitude along the arch of the bridge to the top. The attraction entrance was located on Luban Road, at the base of the Puxi side of the bridge. The <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> provides great views of Shanghai and the Expo 2010 site during the Expo. Currently (as of 03.05.2016) the bridge is closed for sightseeing.|$|E
25|$|The Bloomberg School of Public Health {{is located}} in the East Baltimore campus of the Johns Hopkins University. The campus, collectively known as the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI), is also home to the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing and {{comprises}} several city blocks, radiating outwards from the Billings Building of the Johns Hopkins Hospital with its historic dome. The main building on which the school is located is on North Wolfe Street; it has nine floors and features an <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> and a fitness center on the top floor. The Bloomberg School also occupies Hampton House on North Broadway. The school is also serviced by the Welch Medical Library, a central resource shared by all the schools of the Medical Campus.

Public transportation to and from the campus is served by the Baltimore Metro Subway, local buses, and the JHMI shuttle.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, the 85th floor {{became the}} home of RCA's New York {{television}} operations, first as experimental station W2XBS channel 1, then as commercial station WNBT, channel 1 (now WNBC-TV channel 4) from July 1941 on. NBC's FM station W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use {{of the top of}} the building until 1950, when the FCC ordered the exclusive deal broken, based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York-area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Construction on a giant tower began on July 27, 1950. Other television broadcasters then joined RCA at the building, on the 83rd, 82nd, and 81st floors, often along with sister FM stations. Multiple transmissions of TV and FM began from the new tower in 1951, and was completed by 1953. Six broadcasters paid a combined $600,000 {{for the use of the}} antenna in 1951 per year. In 1965, a separate set of FM antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> to act as a master antenna.|$|E
50|$|Except for Bartel Road and Meadville Road, both {{of which}} pass through the WMA, all other roads are unpaved and {{reserved}} for official use.

500|$|The {{construction}} of the Singer Tower was announced by the company in 1906, who intended to produce the tallest skyscraper in the world. The company already had several low-rise buildings in New York that the tower would be incorporated into and planned to rent out {{the bottom half of}} the tower to tenants to subsidize their use of the upper half. The skyscraper was designed by Ernest Flagg, a Beaux-Arts advocate and noted critic of existing skyscrapers, who justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform. The design was technically challenging: the tall, narrow tower needed special wind bracing, and the deep bedrock on the site required particularly deep foundations. The tower was faced in dark brick and followed the Beaux-Arts style used by the rest of the complex, with a galleried lobby fitted out in Italian marble. When it opened in 1908, it had 47 stories and was [...] tall; visitors paid $0.50 ($12 in 2010 terms) each to use the <b>observation</b> <b>area</b> at the top of the building to see the views.|$|E

40|$|According to the pairwise-comparison {{version of}} the ancient sorites paradox, a {{stimulus}} space may contain sequences of stimuli in which any two successive stimuli are not discriminable while the 8 ̆ 5 rst {{and the last one}} are. This hypoth-esis, often described as an empirical fact, motivates such well-known theoretical constructs as semiorders and interval orders. A rigorous analysis of the notion of (in) discriminability, however, shows that the hypothesis has no empirical jus-ti cation. Moreover, the pairwise-comparison version of sorites is ruled out by the laws of Regular Minimality (for same-di¤erent judgments) and Regular Me-diality (for greater-less judgments) proposed by the author as governing principles for comparisons of stimuli belonging to two 8 ̆ 5 xed <b>observation</b> <b>areas</b> (e. g., right-left, or rst-second). To deal with all possible forms of perceptual sorites, however, a generalization of Regular Minimality/Mediality is presented which involves multiple <b>observation</b> <b>areas</b> (e. g., multiple spatial locations).
