40|$|Background: Concentration of {{knowledge}} work in cities generates innovations entailing economic development. This paper addresses {{the challenge of}} turning around the present trend of urban sprawl toward the concentrated knowledge work in cities. The assumption is that dislocation of office and residential housing entailing longer commuting mileage is {{the main cause of}} urban sprawl. Methods: The life cycle costs method is used for comparison of <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> is compared to the concentrated mega <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> outside cities, as well as the local and home offices within cities. The life cycle costs are assessed with statistical data on space, materials and energy, and information services. These are the main resources of the <b>offices</b> <b>systems</b> given labor and capital. Results: Commuting costs about 22 % of the annual average wage and causes congestion, fragmentation of districts, health risks and pollution. These high costs can be reduced by changes in the <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>office</b> <b>system</b> with commuting adds 40 % to the average labor costs. The innovative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> reduce these costs by 15 to 28 % of the present offices. Sensitivity analyses underpin the findings for nearly all urban conditions. The local <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> are particularly cost-effective. The local <b>office</b> <b>system</b> can also save nearly 78 % energy and reduce 74 % CO 2 emission of the present offices along with less space use. Congestion, as well as fragmentation of communities and nature caused by commuting can be avoided. Conclusions: Some project developers invest in the distributed offices. Policies encourage such investments if they reallocate funds from infrastructure into refurbishing of the available housing and internalize the external effects of land use in the costs of real estate development. These policies increase smartness of cities, reduce energy use, and improve living qualities in cities...|$|R

In this paper, we propose to structure the selection problem in a hierarchical fashion, with the top level representing the single overall objective, the intermediate level(s) representing the users' needs, and the lowest level representing the viable candidate set of alternative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> to be evaluated. A recently developed technique termed analytical hierarchies is employed, and a case study is presented to illustrate how the technique can be used in the selection of <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} impact of {{physician}} education and facilitator assisted <b>office</b> <b>system</b> interventions on cancer early detection and preventive services. DESIGN [...] A randomised trial of two interventions alone and in combination. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] Physicians in 98 ambulatory care practices in the United States. INTERVENTIONS [...] The education intervention consisted of a day long physician meeting directed at improving knowledge, attitudes, and skills relevant to cancer prevention and early detection. The <b>office</b> <b>system</b> intervention consisted of assistance from a project facilitator in establishing routines for providing needed services. These routines included division of responsibilities for providing services among physicians and their staff {{and the use of}} medical record flow sheets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The proportions of patients provided the cancer prevention and early detection services indicated annually according to the US National Cancer Institute. RESULTS [...] Based on cross sectional patient surveys, the <b>office</b> <b>system</b> intervention was associated with an increase in mammography, the recommendation to do breast self examination, clinical breast examination, faecal occult blood testing, advice to quit smoking, and the recommendation to decrease dietary fat. Education was associated only with an increase in mammography. Record review for a patient cohort confirmed cross sectional survey findings regarding the <b>office</b> <b>system</b> for mammography and faecal occult blood testing. CONCLUSION [...] Community practices assisted by a facilitator in {{the development and implementation of}} an <b>office</b> <b>system</b> can substantially improve provision of cancer early detection and preventive services...|$|R
