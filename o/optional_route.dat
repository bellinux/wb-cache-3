40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} factors that impact user flight schedules during air traffic congestion. In pre-departure flight planning, users file one route per flight, which often leads to increased delays, inefficient airspace utilization, and exclusion of user flight preferences. In this paper, first the idea of filing alternate routes and providing priorities on each of those routes is introduced. Then, the impact of varying planning interval and system imposed departure delay increment is discussed. The metrics of total delay and equity are used for analyzing {{the impact of these}} factors on increased traffic and on different users. The results are shown for four cases, with and without the <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> and priority assignments. Results demonstrate that adding priorities to <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> further improves system performance compared to filing one route per flight and using first-come first-served scheme. It was also observed that a two-hour planning interval with a five-minute system imposed departure delay increment results in highest delay reduction. The trend holds for a scenario with increased traffic...|$|R

30|$|Connectivity-aware routing (CAR) [5] {{addressed}} the above problem by selecting an <b>optional</b> <b>route</b> {{with the least}} probability of network disconnection and avoiding carry-and-forward delay. The route probability of connectivity is calculated through the probabilistic model of network disconnection with the information of statistical traffic data. At the same time, CAR mentioned the impact of traffic light on connectivity, {{but it did not}} apply this result to the routing protocols' design. In addition, the inaccuracy of road density calculation might affect the path selection and overall network performance. ACAR [6] proposed an on-the-fly density collection scheme to improve the accuracy of CAR. Landmark overlays for urban vehicular routing environments (LOUVRE) [7] solved the network disconnection problem by using an approach to efficiently build a landmark overlay network on top of the urban topology. The overlay links are created if and only if the vehicle density is higher than a predefined threshold. LOUVRE performed higher in packet delivery ratio and achieved lower hop counts than GPSR. However, the predefined threshold is calculated under the assumption that vehicles are uniformly distributed along the road. In the case where vehicles are not uniformly distributed in Figure  1, LOUVRE may also encounter the problem of disconnections.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{unpredictable}} {{activities of}} primary users (PUs) make the channel availabilities in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) very unstable. The dynamic channel availabilities cause routing in CRNs {{to be more}} difficult than in traditional wireless networks. Specifically, when a source node needs to select a route to reach the destination, the “optimal ” route during the route selection phase may not be reliable because of the sudden appearance of a PU, and thus, may not be optimal during the data transmission phase. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol based on the source routing in traditional wireless networks. We consider the angle dimension of CRNs by assuming that the directional antennas are equipped on every node. The directional antennas can facilitate the marking of boundary areas of primary users. We use the USRP/Gnuradio to show the sensing result differences of different directions at the boundary area of a primary user. For every <b>optional</b> <b>route</b> between a source node and a destination node, we can evaluate its reliability and other performance by evaluating the PU areas it passes through, and estimating the possible transmission rate of each link on this route. Based on these parameters, we propose an algorithm for route selection, considering both the reliability and delay. Our routing protocol only requires very limited piggyback information, compared to other routing protocols in CRNs. It is efficient and highly adaptable under the dynamic channel availabilities. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations. Index Terms—Cognitive radio networks, directional antennas, USRP/Gnuradio, boundary nodes, routing. I...|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of moving {{vehicles}} increases rapidly everyday, the need for analysis, processing, and modeling traffic data is vital. Moreover, the extraction of additional information about traffic conditions, <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> and possible prediction of troublesome situations, such as traffic jams becomes necessary. In this work, {{we deal with the}} analysis, pre-processing, modelling and storage techniques of traffic data in a Moving Object Database (MOD) of a traffic management system. Furthermore, we apply data extraction techniques in MOD assisting the prediction of troublesome situations, or optional cases, such as alternative routes when traffic is congested. In order to realize MOD, based on real-world requirements about traffic in the Athens Metropolitan Area, we analyse the fundamental concept of movement of a vehicle and register its semantics and properties in terms of a conceptual model. We organize them in a database, including vehicles, routes, trajectories (i. e., traces leaving behind, as they move), and relations among them. Building a MOD is not a trivial issue. Its data consists of (i) spatial data, (i) non-spatial data and (iii) trajectories. Spatial comprises infrastructure information such as roads, buildings, obstructions, etc. and the non-spatial data consists of other thematic information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to broaden the Terrestrial Transport Infrastructure (TTI) {{assessment}} process into the field of Ecosystem Services (ES), i. e., the benefits people derive from ecosystems. Taking into account ES in an ex ante assessment of public infrastructure projects is of critical importance for the improvement of transportation decision-making tools, such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA). For EIA, the integration of an ES based approach opens the possibility of measuring a loss in ES supply (and its economic value); this provides a means of selecting among different possible pathways for the infrastructure. For CBA, since the ES loss induced by the selected pathway is expressed in monetary terms, it can be integrated as a standard social cost in the analysis, permitting a more efficient control of natural capital loss. We illustrate these points by assessing the loss of a global climate regulation service due to the soil tillage and sealing caused by a TTI construction, using the example of a high-speed rail in Western France. We select three <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> among the proposed routes and analyse which route has the least impact on the global climate regulation service and its economic value...|$|R
40|$|Mountain biking is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in urban areas, including in forest remnants in Australia cities. To increase the technical challenge for riders, trail technical features such as jumps, bridges, mounds and ditches, along with informal trails are often constructed without authorisation. We assessed the social, environmental and management challenges associated {{with the presence of}} such features, developed a method for assessing them, and then used this method to examine them in an endangered forest within the Gold Coast in Australia. In a 29 ha remnant of Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) forest there were 116 unauthorised features, mostly jumps, ditches and mounds, which collectively resulted in an area of 1601 m 2 of bare soil and 4010 m 2 of undergrowth cleared. Features differed in their size, construction materials used, and their impacts on the environment. Although nearly two thirds had low to moderate safety, most were in moderate to good condition, had fall zones and <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> for riders. Management options for land managers, in this case a publicly funded University, include (1) feature removal and site rehabilitation, (2) conversion to official features, (3) removal and provision of an alternative location for official features, or (4) maintain the status quo. There are social, financial and environmental benefits and limitations to each of these options highlighting that unauthorised trail technical features are a challenge for planners and managers that often have no easy solution.

40|$|A symposium. D. {{functional}} theory calcns. {{were carried}} out to analyze the reaction energy of solid-state acid-catalyzed Me-transfer reactions. Different mechanistic routes for the alkylation of C 6 H 6 and PhMe by MeOH were compared. An associative reaction path via an intermediate complex of MeoH and the substrate is the preferred route. The activation energy is 123 and. apprx. 120 kJ/mol for C 6 H 6 and PhMe, resp. A MeO-mediated path involves very high activation barriers compared to the associative route. However, coadsorbed H 2 O gives a large redn. of the activation energy for this reaction. Different mechanisms for PhMe transalkylation, involving Ph 2 CH 2 as an intermediate, directly via Me transfer, and MeO-mediated, were compared. For the 1 st mechanism, the preferred route is that where the reaction chain of elementary reactions is propagated via H- transfer. The rate-detg. step is the initial dehydrogenation, with an activation energy of + 277 kJ/mol, which is present only in the very 1 st step of the reaction chain. In the following steps, the initial dehydrogenation is replaced by proton-assisted cracking of Ph 2 CH 2 as the step with the highest activation barrier. The direct mechanisms via Me transfer or via intermediate MeO do present activation barriers that are lower than the dehydrogenation step but higher than via Ph 2 CH 2 /H- transfer-mediated reaction. For small-pore zeolites, where large mols. like Ph 2 CH 2 cannot be formed, they {{should be considered as}} <b>optional</b> <b>routes</b> for the transalkylation reactio...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} research on slavery during the antebellum, few authors {{have investigated the}} connection between the Mississippi river and its importance and status as a symbol of freedom throughout The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, written by Mark Twain. Therefore, this essay attempts to analyze just how much the river actually meant for Huck and Jim during their journey towards freedom. The methodology of this analysis is based on a qualitative content analysis where categories are created and put it in relation to the historical and political landscape the novel presents. By investigating how the river functioned as an <b>optional</b> escape <b>route</b> that would lead the slaves far away from the notoriously bad treatment on the cotton fields, as well as the dangerous riverside settings which involved several risks for both Huck and Jim, this essay concludes that the river does not only work as an escape route away from captivity and civilization, it also provided the characters with a comfortable and safe home which alone could symbolize liberty...|$|R

The question, {{whether an}} <b>optional</b> set of <b>routes</b> can be rep-resented as {{shortest}} paths, and if yes, then how, {{has been a}} rather scarcely investigated problem up until now. In turn, an algorithm that, given an arbitrary set of trac engineered paths, can eciently compute OSPF link weights as to map the given paths to shortest paths may be of huge importance in today's IP networks, which still rely on legacy shortest-path- rst routing protocols. This article establishes the fundamental the-ory and algorithms of shortest path representability, and concludes that in general {{it is much more}} dicult task to compute shortest path rep-resentable paths than to actually calculate link weights for such paths...|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{pathways}} for certifying {{school administrators}} {{are readily available}} in many states. Notable models include internships, provisional licensing based on prior experience, and testing. The rationale for implementing these systems include: (1) a shortage of certified personnel to fill vacant positions, (2) a perceived lack of quality candidates, (3) dissatisfaction with {{institutions of higher education}} and programs of preparation, and (4) a perception of unfairness toward individuals who sincerely wish to become professional educators but face real or imagined roadblocks to licensure. Philosophical differences aside, these options are law in most states.

We therefore investigated whether the application of pectin insulin (PI) -containing dermal patches of different insulin concentrations sustain controlled release of insulin into the bloodstream of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats with concomitant alleviation of diabetic symptoms in target tissues, most importantly, muscle and liver. Methods: Oral glucose test (OGT) responses to PI dermal matrix patches (2. 47, 3. 99, 9. 57, 16. 80 mg/kg) prepared by dissolving pectin/insulin in deionised water and solidified with CaCl 2 were monitored in diabetic rats given a glucose load after an 18 -h fast. Short-term (5 weeks) metabolic effects were assessed in animals treated thrice daily with PI patches 8 hours apart. Animals treated with drug-free pectin and insulin (175 mg/kg, sc) acted as untreated and treated positive controls, respectively. Blood, muscle and liver samples were collected for measurements of selected biochemical parameters. Results: After 5 weeks, untreated diabetic rats exhibited hyperglycaemia and depleted hepatic and muscle glycogen concentrations.
