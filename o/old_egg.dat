Maximum parasitism was observed 95. 7 and 84. 3 % at 28 C degree, while minimum parasitism was 61. 3 and 39. 6 % at 32 C degree on S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. The most favorable temperature was 28 oC on which maximum parasitism and adult emergence were obtained from S. cereallela eggs. Maximum parasitism was observed 97. 4 and 79. 4 % in 2 h old, while minimum parasitism was 24. 6 and 17. 3 % in 72 h <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> of S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. Parasitism by T. chilonis decreased with increasing host eggs age. Maximum adult T. chilonis emergence was 98. 2 % in 2 h <b>old</b> <b>eggs,</b> while minimum emergence was 21. 5 % on 72 h <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> of S. cereallela. Adult T. chilonis longevity on the host eggs of different ages of female wasp was non-significantly different to each other except the 2 and 12 h <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> which were significantly different from rest of the treatments in both hosts' eggs of different ages. Maximum female longevity was 4. 0 d on 2 h fresh eggs C. cephalonica, while minimum was 3. 0 d on 24 - 48 h <b>old</b> S. cereallela <b>eggs.</b> The female ratio for different host eggs age was almost non-significant to each other except 2 h <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> with maximum number of female (64).

40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of crude protease of Aspergillus oryzae {{to suppress the}} hatchability of Pomacea canaliculata eggs is highlighted. The enzyme was produced through solid state fermentation (SSF) using cassava, which is cheap and abundantly available. It {{was found that the}} enzyme suppressed the hatchability of P. canaliculata eggs as much as 30 % and 20 % at 20. 8 U/ml enzyme for 3 and 9 days <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> respectively. The ANOVA result revealed that the hatchability was significantly affected by both protease concentration as well as egg’s age. The LC 50 for 3 and 9 days <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> were 3. 29 U/ml and 3. 54 U/ml, respectively; while LC 95 for 3 and 9 days <b>old</b> <b>eggs</b> were 19. 11 U/ml and 20. 09 U/ml respectively. It is proposed that the crude protease propagated from SSF using locally available and cheap material should be considered as an alternative biopesticide to suppress the hatchability of P. canaliculata eggs.

The toxicity of five different insecticides used in cereal fields to the parasitized eggs was investigated under laboratory conditions.

Among the treated developmental stages (except for the fenirothion), 3 - and 8 - day- <b>old</b> parasitized <b>eggs</b> showed the highest and the lowest emergence percentages, respectively. Deltamethrin had maximum effect on emergence percentage whereas phosalone had the least hazardous effects.

40|$|International audienceVarious {{physiological}} {{effects of}} Wolbachia infection {{have been reported}} in invertebrates, but the impact of this infection on behavior and the consequences of these behavioral modifications on fitness have rarely been studied. Here, we investigate the effect of Wolbachia infection on the estimation of host nutritive resource quality in a parasitoid wasp. We compare decision-making in uninfected and Wolbachia-infected strains of Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) on patches containing either fresh or <b>old</b> host <b>eggs.</b> For both strains, fresh eggs were better hosts than <b>older</b> <b>eggs,</b> but the difference was smaller for the infected strain than for the uninfected strain. Oviposition behavior of uninfected wasps followed the predictions of optimal foraging theory. They behaved differently toward high- vs. low-quality hosts, withmore hosts visited andmore ovipositions, fewer high-quality hosts used for feeding or superparasitism, and a sex ratio that was morebiased toward females in patches containing high-quality hosts than in patches containing low-quality ones. Uninfected wasps also displayed shorter acceptance and rejection times in high-quality hosts than in hosts of lower quality. In contrast, infected wasps were less efficient in evaluating the nutritive quality of the host (fresh vs. <b>old</b> <b>eggs)</b> and had a reduced ability to discriminate between unparasitized and parasitized hosts. Furthermore, they needed more energy and therefore engaged in host feeding more often.

40|$|The studies {{investigated}} {{the storage of}} glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) eggs below the temperature threshold for embryonic development and host acceptability and emergence from cold-stored hosts by Gonatocerus ashmeadi (G. ashmeadi). Our results showed that GWSS embryos failed to hatch after storage at 2 ˚C for 5 days and 5 ˚C for 11 days. G. ashmeadi parasitized dead Homalodisca coagulata (H. coagulata) eggs and completed development in hosts killed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post oviposition. Host age and length of time in cold storage were factors that influenced host acceptability and progeny production. After exposure to 2 ˚C for 5 days and storage at 10 °C for 10 - 60 days, parasitism of 1 day <b>old</b> GWSS <b>eggs</b> by G. ashmeadi ranged from 95 % to 45 %.
