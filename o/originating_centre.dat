5000|$|The {{technique}} {{was used in}} Hellenistic times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry. [...] The British Museum has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3 cm wide and 11.4 cm high, one of two from a tomb in Canosa in Apulia dating to around 270-160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with lotus and acanthus motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures. There {{are a handful of}} other near complete examples, and rather more fragments. These pieces are usually assigned to Alexandria in Egypt, which is often seen as the <b>originating</b> <b>centre</b> for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century satirist Martial and other sources; one seems to show a Nilotic landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere. However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on Rhodes. [...] A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer Athenaeus) mentions two vessels that are diachysa ("with gold in it") and very likely made by this technique.|$|E
40|$|The first 325 Exeter Universal stems (309 patients) {{implanted}} at the <b>originating</b> <b>centre</b> were inserted between March 1988 and February 1990 by a {{group of}} surgeons with differing experience. In this report we describe the clinical and radiological results at a mean of 15. 7 years (14. 7 to 17. 3) after operation with no loss to follow-up. There were 97 patients (108 hips) with replacements still in situ and 31 (31 hips) who had undergone a further procedure. With an endpoint of revision for aseptic loosening, the survivorship at 17 years was 100 % and 90. 4 % for the femoral and acetabular component, respectively. The mean Merle D’Aubigné and Postel scores at review were 5. 4 (SD 0. 97) for pain and 4. 5 (SD 1. 72) for function. The mean Oxford score was 38. 4 (SD 9. 8) (0 to 48 worst-to-best scale) and the mean combined Harris pain and function score was 73. 2 (SD 16. 9). Radiological review showed excellent preservation of bone stock in the proximal femur and no failures of the femoral component.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 142 consecutive primary total hip replacements implanted into 123 patients between 1988 and 1993 {{using the}} Exeter Universal femoral stem. A total of 74 patients (88 hips) had survived {{for ten years}} or more and were reviewed at a mean of 12. 7 years (10 to 17). There was no loss to follow-up. The rate of revision of the femoral component for aseptic loosening and osteolysis was 1. 1 % (1 stem), that for revision for any cause was 2. 2 % (2 stems), and for re-operation for any cause was 21. 6 % (19 hips). Re-operation was because of failure of the acetabular component in all but two hips. All but one femoral component subsided within the cement mantle to a mean of 1. 52 mm (0 to 8. 3) at the final follow-up. One further stem had subsided excessively (8 mm) and had lucent lines at the cement-stem and cement-bone interfaces. This was classified as a radiological failure and is awaiting revision. One stem was revised for deep infection and one for excessive peri-articular osteolysis. Defects of the cement mantle (Barrack grade C and D) were found in 28 % of stems (25 hips), associated with increased subsidence (p = 0. 01), but were not associated with endosteal lysis or failure. Peri-articular osteolysis {{was significantly related to}} the degree of polyethylene wear (p &# 60; 0. 001), which was in turn associated with a younger age (p = 0. 01) and male gender (p &# 60; 0. 001). The use of the Exeter metal-backed acetabular component was a notable failure with 12 of 32 hips (37. 5 %) revised for loosening. The Harris-Galante components failed with excessive wear, osteolysis and dislocation with 15 % revised (5 of 33 hips). Only one of 23 hips with a cemented Elite component (4 %) was revised for loosening and osteolysis. Our findings show that the Exeter Universal stem implanted outside the <b>originating</b> <b>centre</b> has excellent medium-term results...|$|E
