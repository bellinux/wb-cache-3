25|$|The scene shifted <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} photographed and most remembered scenes: the world's first traffic jam. The chaos {{included}} {{items such as}} an upset horse, a spilling ice truck, and kids screaming during the 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Pirates often {{targeted}} slavers. For example, the 300 ton English frigate Concord {{launched in}} 1710 but {{was captured by}} the French one year later. She was modified to hold more cargo, including slaves, and renamed La Concorde de Nantes. Sailing as a slave ship, she was captured by the pirate Captain Benjamin Hornigold on November 28, 1717, near the island of Martinique. Hornigold turned her <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his men, Edward Teach (later known as Blackbeard), and made him her captain. Teach then renamed her the Queen Anne's Revenge. By 1750, slavery was a legal institution {{in all of the}} 13 American colonies, and the profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy {{at the time of the}} Industrial Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Julio's airship gets {{damaged in}} a storm, and the Order {{stop in the}} steampunk-inspired gnome town of Tinkertown to repair it. Haley and the airship's captain deal with a golem made out of Haley's archenemy Crystal (who she killed during the Don't Split the Party storyline), and Roy and Durkon search for a cleric who can cure Durkon's vampirism. They {{encounter}} Veldrina and Wrecan, who are traveling to the Godsmoot, an interfaith council of clerics. The Order flies the pair to the Godsmoot {{with the goal of}} restoring Durkon to life. At the Godsmoot, they discover that due to the threat of the Snarl, the gods are casting votes (conveyed through their mortal representatives) on whether to destroy the world and start over. Durkon, revealed to be the High Priest of Hel, votes in favor of the destruction, causing a tie. With the swing votes of demigod priests potentially dooming the world, Roy tries to eliminate the High Priest of Hel to negate the vote. They fight to a stand still and the demigod priests vote and also cause a tie - with the priest of Dvalin needing to consult with the Dwarven Council before he can cast a vote. It is then revealed that Durkon has killed and vampirized {{all the members of the}} Creed of Stone, who walk into the room. Durkon abdicates his position as High Priest and hands it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the newly formed vampires as he and a few other vampires teleport to the dwarven lands to dominate the dwarven council so they will vote in Hel's favor. Roy regroups with his team and they fly to dwarven city named Firmament,.|$|E

50|$|The festival {{has grown}} <b>over</b> time <b>to</b> become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{successful}} multicultural festivals in Australia.

50|$|The reforms led {{to severe}} {{inflation}} (prices grew by over 200%), a large {{increase in unemployment}} (from virtually zero in December 1989 <b>to</b> <b>over</b> <b>one</b> million—11% <b>of</b> the urban workers—in 1991) and food shortages, leading to a growing popular discontent.|$|R

40|$|Spurious {{interference}} {{limits the}} performance of many interferometric measurements. Digitally enhanced interferometry (DEI) improves measurement sensitivity by augmenting conventional heterodyne interferometry with pseudo-random noise (PRN) code phase modulation. DEI effectively changes the measurement problem from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> hardware (optics, electronics), which may deteriorate <b>over</b> time, <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> software (modulation, digital signal processing), which does not. DEI isolates interferometric signals based on their delay. Interferometric signals are effectively time-tagged by phase-modulating the laser source with a PRN code. DEI improves measurement sensitivity by exploiting the autocorrelation properties of the PRN to isolate only the signal of interest and reject spurious interference. The properties of the PRN code determine the degree of isolation...|$|R
