Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> pitches give me a wide palette of choices.|$|E
25|$|There has {{not been}} any push for full {{semantic}} unification of all semantically-linked characters, though the idea would treat the respective users of East Asian languages the same, whether they write in Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese, Shinjitai Japanese or Vietnamese. Instead of some variants getting unique codepoints while other groups of variants have to share single codepoints, all variants could be reliably expressed only with metadata tags (e.g., CSS formatting in webpages). The burden would be <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> who use differing versions of 直, 別, 兩, 兔, whether that difference be due to simplification, international variance or intra-national variance. However, for some platforms (e.g., smartphones), a device may come with only one font pre-installed. The system font must make a decision for the default glyph for each codepoint and these glyphs can differ greatly, indicating different underlying graphemes.|$|E

500|$|However the {{observations}} of a stellar occultation in January 2017 cast a doubt <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> conclusions. The measured shape of Haumea, while elongated as presumed before, appeared to have significantly larger dimensions – {{according to the data}} obtained from the occultation Haumea is approximately the diameter of Pluto along its longest axis and about half that at its poles. So, the resulting density of about 1.8 g/cm3 is more in line with densities of other large TNOs. This resulting shape is inconsistent with a homogenous body in hydrostatic equilibrium; although it is expected to be differentiated, it is not known whether that would make its shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.

Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite."

Usher may want to be no place but home, but there's a big, wide world out there with pitfalls aplenty.

2500|$|Smith's {{major new}} car program {{prior to the}} 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called [...] "The biggest {{catastrophe}} in American industrial history." [...] Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, {{the plan was to}} replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by Fortune why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “I don't know. It's a mysterious thing. I've said I'll take my share of the blame <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things. I was part of the team.” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.|$|E

2500|$|If her radicalism {{may be seen}} to some as a {{negative}} thing, however Sheila Jeffreys rationalizes Browne’s radicalism saying that to “promote the joy of sex [...] it [...] necessary to be uncompromising in their attack <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> whom they considered to be {{standing in the way}} of this march to sexual freedom.” [...] She notes that in order to do this feminists were required to, before World War One, to make these attacks on the vast majority of their colleagues, particularly “spinsters amidst the ranks”. [...] References to the attack on a specific “spinster” of the time, Kathlyn Oliver is referenced by both Jeffreys, Hall and Rowbotham in their articles, solidifying that there is an importance of these attacks in furthering an understanding of women’s sexual activity not having an adverse effect on them. Jeffreys notes that Browne was very capable of getting her point across when discussing her opinion that sex should be enjoyed by women openly to Oliver, and the power of her argument is supported by Hall’s assertion that later Oliver joined the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology to look into her sexuality, a suggestion made to her by Browne.|$|E

Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability." [...] He added that [...] "If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?" ...|$|E
