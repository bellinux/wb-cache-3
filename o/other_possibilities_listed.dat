5000|$|Although sexual {{reproduction}} is defined at the cellular level, key features of {{sexual reproduction}} operate within {{the structures of}} the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called DNA that the biological processes of reproduction can [...] "read" [...] like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these [...] "books", called chromosomes. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called sex chromosomes because of their role in sex determination. Ova always have the same sex chromosome, labelled X. About half of spermatozoa also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a Y-chromosome. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, {{depending on whether the}} sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome.
