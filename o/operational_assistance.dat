2500|$|As part of {{terrestrial}} radio giant Clear Channel Communications' early investment into XM in 1998, the companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements {{as long as}} Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like Coast to Coast AM, but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a forward sales agreement relating to its ownership of XM. During {{the third quarter of}} 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the [...] and the [...] The Arbitration Panel decided that the <b>Operational</b> <b>Assistance</b> Agreement would remain in effect, including Clear Channel's right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing Nashville!, KISS, Mix, and Sunny (now The Music Summit). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming (Fox Sports Radio, Extreme XM, Talk Radio). Clear Channel also controlled America Right (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including ReachMD, America's Talk remain on the air. The Pink Channel, National Lampoon Comedy Radio, WSIX-FM, WLW, and Rock@Random were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like Bollywood & Beyond, The Music Summit, and Sixx Sense, all of which are on the air today.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{provides a}} brief overview of wildlife damage-related research needs as they are perceived by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Animal Damage Control (ADC) State Directors in the Eastern ADC Region. There are 23 State Directors in the Eastern ADC Region who are responsible for managing <b>operational</b> and technical <b>assistance</b> animal damage programs in 31 states. Because of their collective experience with a variety of species and control techniques under various environmental circumstances, their input and insight should be valuable in helping those in the research community more clearly define wildlife damage-related research needs. State Directors responded to a mail questionnaire developed with the assistance of Eastern Regional personnel. The questionnaire, which was developed with a 2 ̆ 2 taxonomic 2 ̆ 2 flavor, identified species (e. g. coyote), groups of species (e. g. blackbirds) or species interactions with human activities (e. g. aquatic birds/aquaculture) as research need headings. A few potential specific research needs were listed under each heading. For example, under the research need heading, coyote, were: 1) damage assessment and 2) need for control techniques that can be applied in the east. State Directors were requested to respond - yes - if they concurred or - no - if they did not feel there was a need. If the response was yes, they were requested to proceed by answering yes or no to the specific areas of need identified under a heading. Additions of headings and/or specific needs by each State Director were allowed. State Directors were also encouraged to be parochial in their response, thus limiting their perceptions of research needs to their geographic area of responsibility...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{search and}} rescue in the Alps of Austria and Switzerland is a {{prominent}} and challenging example of emergency response tasks. Significant numbers of {{search and rescue}} operations are carried out every year. In Switzerland, the “Alpine Rettung ” in 2001 served 12. 739 mission hours in 431 missions. Of these, 8. 193 hours were spent on search missions. In Austria in 2002 alone, of 7. 495 “Bergrettungsdienst ” operations 242 were search missions. 17. 229 members served a total of 40. 720 mission hours. Operating in small teams, rescue personnel have to be coordinated over large areas, often in rough terrain and adverse weather conditions. Additional assets like helicopters or reconnaissance planes are called in on demand. Operations control typically uses a mobile command post (car or van), that is driven close to the area. Due {{to the number of}} such tasks and complexity of operations, often with human lives at stake, there is significant demand for assistance by state-of-the-art technology. Key tasks of support are, on the one hand, position, situation and intent reporting of field teams to operations control.

Polar cap absorption models predict the 30 [*]MHz cosmic noise absorption, A, measured by riometers, based on real-time measurements of the integrated proton flux-energy spectrum, J. However, empirical models in common use cannot account for regional and day-to-day variations in the daytime and nighttime profiles of αeff(z) or the related sensitivity parameter, m = A / sqrt(J). Large prediction errors occur during twilight when m changes rapidly, and due to errors locating the rigidity cutoff latitude. Modeling the twilight change in m as a linear or Gauss error-function transition over a range of solar-zenith angles (χl[*]<[*]χ[*]<[*]χu) provides a better fit to measurements than selecting day or night αeff profiles based on the Earth-shadow height. Optimal model parameters were determined for several polar cap riometers for large SPEs in 1998 – 2005. The optimal χl parameter {{was found to be}} most variable, with smaller values (as low as 60 °) postsunrise compared with presunset and with positive correlation between riometers over a wide area. Day and night values of m exhibited higher correlation for closely spaced riometers. A nowcast simulation is presented in which rigidity boundary latitude and twilight model parameters are optimized by assimilating age-weighted measurements from 25 riometers. The technique reduces model bias, and root-mean-square errors are reduced by up to 30 % compared with a model employing no riometer data assimilation.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] PU vir CHO, 1993. Research Methodology An initial {{literature}} {{study on the}} various aspects pertaining to the compilation of a scientifically programmed strategic plan was undertaken. Applying proposed methods described in literature, a thorough internal investigation was conducted in close collaboration with Bankorp's senior and middle management. These interviews resulted {{in the identification of}} internal strengths and weaknesses of the Risk Management Division, as well as the perceived external threats and opportunities. Interviews were conducted in an informal, conversational manner, although uniform structured questions were posed to those questioned. The questionnaire consisted predominantly of qualitative questions of which the minority yielded categorical responses. Study Objectives The compilation of a strategic plan for Risk Management Division of Bankorp. Subsequent to the most recent rationalisation in the Bankorp group, a decision was taken to create a Risk Management Division with the following objectives from the CEO: - To establish a risk management awareness in the Group and to act as facilitator in the establishing of this approach; - to act as watchdog and early warning system; - to provide the management committee of Bankorp with an unbiased opinion regarding the strategic direction of the Group and the implementation of strategy by management; As the external environment of the Risk Management Division consists of the task environments of the other divisions within the Group, there is no suggestion of an environmental or competitor analysis in the true sense of the word. Strategic plan Organisational objectives are sub divided into the establishment and defining of the division's business, ethos objectives and mission statement. Strategic objectives include elements of a limited number of scenario's, threats of certain risks materialising, opportunities within the division, key success factors and the establishing of long and short term objectives. Alternative strategies were proposed to facilitate the required risk management approach, together with contra-arguments: - Each division could leave the management of its own risks to the Risk Management division, but line managers must at all times remain the owners of the risk while Risk Management division only aids the other divisions in the facilitation of the risk management approach; - The services of an external party could be contracted to facilitate the required approach; however uncertainty exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of such a step. In addition, an internal facilitator is more fully conversant with the situation within the Group than an external consultant; and - Each division could act as its own facilitator, however such an approach incurs the risk that information relayed to the Board of Directors could be in an unstructured and non-uniform format. Because of the fact that risks are preferably left where they originated, action plans of the Risk Management Division are directed at assisting the other divisions in handling risks in the most effective manner, and monitoring the systems and procedures implemented to minimise these risks. The following action plans are suggested: - Assistance in the formal identification of risks by examining <b>operational</b> activities; - <b>Assistance</b> in the formal documentation of risks by attaching an indicator to each activity, displaying the impact that this activity might have on the risks inherent in a division. The type of impact could be categorised as: (A) enormous, (B) great, (C) medium or (D) minimal; - Support in the determining of circumstances that might increase or decrease risk; - The facilitation process also entails support and assistance in : a) formulating an assessment of whether the management processes currently applied are sufficient, or require improvement; and b) the draughting of risk summaries stating how critical certain risks might be at that moment; - Assistance in the formulating of a risk decision that would entail the categorising risks as: a) risks that are acceptable; b) risks that are accepted but are disseminated; c) risks that are acceptable only if managed by formal policy; and d) risks that under no circumstances may be accepted. - Risk Management division also supports the other divisions in the draughting of annual risk management plans that precede each annual strategic planning session. - Finally a comprehensive human resources plan has to be implemented to manage the high-level manpower that is present in this division.
