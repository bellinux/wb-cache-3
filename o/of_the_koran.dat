25|$|Euthanasia is {{a complex}} issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is {{considered}} contrary to Islamic law and holy texts. Among interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all Muslim majority countries.|$|E

Such practice, well attested to in Greek and Latin manuscript production, {{can be found in}} various cultural spheres.

They said that night, soldiers carried three of the prisoners out of their cells dead, with pieces of torn sheet in their mouths and other torn sheets binding their arms and legs.

25|$|Ottoman Sultan Selim I conquered most of Syria in 1516 after {{defeating}} the Mamlukes at the Battle of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo. Syria {{was part of}} the Ottoman Empire from 1516 to 1918, although with 2 brief captures by the Iranian Safavids, notably under Shah Ismail I and Shah Abbas. Ottoman rule was not burdensome to the Syrians because the Turks, as Muslims, respected Arabic as the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koran,</b> and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus became the major entrepot for Mecca, and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the barakah (spiritual force or blessing) of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the hadj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{propose that the}} polemical {{passages}} in <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> should not be addressed {{as if they were}} aiming at narrating a portion of Muhammad's life but as parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> koranic argumentation about its own origin and status. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> this paper shows how these polemics convey a religious debate by addressing <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacred origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> koranic text and <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> Muhammad's prophetic role, in parallel. The second part provides an analysis <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> argues about its own religious authority through these polemical passages: by meeting expectations which are described as Jewish and Christian, by refusing any attitude of denial, and by accusing <b>the</b> opponents <b>of</b> forgery.

25|$|In this context, presidential {{feminism}} remains ambiguous, as {{is illustrated}} by the speech delivered during the UNFT's third congress, held between December 20–29, 1962, in which he declared that he had to protect the family and guarantee to man the faculty of being its head. The policy of Bourguiba lost its vitality in the 1970s.This absence of new reforms can be explained in different ways: the deterioration of the president's health, the delayed reaction of conservatives remaining reserved in the course of preceding decades and the resistance of society shaken to its foundations. At the same time, power desired the destabilization of the Marxist left and encouraged the founding of the Association for the Preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> in January 1968 which contributed to the birth of the Islamist party Ennahda.|$|E

The new interpretation would interpret the verse as calling for women to be obedient to God.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1927, Thierno Abdourahmane Bah, age eleven had learned to read and write the Koran, the first cycle of the {{traditional}} teaching Fouta-Djallon.

40|$|It’s {{inevitable}} that <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> {{will always be}} a reference (marja’) for Muslims in every thought and action, followed later by al-Sunnah in the second position, both as a reference in understanding <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> or as independent sources in understanding and resolve specific cases.
