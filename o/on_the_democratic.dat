5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

5|$|Colbert {{confirmed}} his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show, stating {{his intention to}} run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a favorite son in his native South Carolina. In an interview with Larry King he revealed that, as his running mate, he would consider Mike Huckabee (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position). He also speculated {{on the possibility of}} a Colbert-Putin or Colbert-Colbert ticket. Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee. Several days later he announced that he was withdrawing from the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at {{one point}} had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E
