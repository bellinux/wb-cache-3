5|$|In 1976, a fire {{destroyed}} the acrylic <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> of Buckminster Fuller's dome, {{and the previous}} year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire. With the site falling into disrepair, and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble ruins of a futuristic city.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer layer}} of the {{epidermis}} (<b>outer</b> <b>skin)</b> consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the outer layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner {{layer of the}} epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E
5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of truffle in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle, it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The truffle is reddish brown with a rough and warty <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature truffles have an odor resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E

25|$|Goldfish-specific {{food has}} less protein and more {{carbohydrate}} than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish {{benefit from the}} addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.|$|R
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's <b>outer</b> <b>skin.</b> Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDouble skin façade (DSF) {{systems are}} more {{effective}} environmental mediators than conventional single skin façade systems, and, due to this reason, their use for tall buildings has increased despite their higher initial costs. While many studies {{have been carried out}} on the environmental performance of the DSF system, research on its structural capability has been very rare. In tall buildings, excessive movement/acceleration can cause serious human discomfort problem. This paper investigates the potential of the DSF system as a structural motion control device in tall buildings. Two design strategies are investigated. In the first scheme, the connectors between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> of the DSF system is designed to have very low axial stiffness with a damping mechanism. Through this design, the dynamic motion of the primary building structure can be substantially reduced. However, the excessive vibration of the DSF <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> is a serious design limitation. The second scheme is investigated to overcome this challenge. While DSF <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> are fixed like those in conventional DSF systems, additional small masses are inserted into the DSF cavity and act as distributed tuned mass dampers (TMDs). Compared to the conventional TMD system, usually located in the occupiable space {{near the top of the}} building, the second scheme has the substantial benefit of saving this valuable occupiable space...|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} cross-section fuselage was an all-metal semi-monocoque structure, of 10 ft diameter, fitted with kapok-filled inner and <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> above floor level.The hydraulically operated main-wheel units {{were similar to}} those of the Lancaster, had single Dunlop wheels and retracted rearward into the inboard engine nacelles. The twin tailwheels retracted rearward into the fuselage and were enclosed by twin longitudinal doors.|$|R
50|$|The Head Standard was Howard Head's first {{successful}} ski design, and arguably {{the first modern}} downhill ski. The Standard used composite construction, with a plywood core sandwiched between aluminum <b>outer</b> <b>skins,</b> steel edges tapering into the core, and a hard plastic base, sidewalls and topsheet. The only major change in ski design since the Standard {{is the use of}} a fibreglass torsion box in place of the aluminum layers.|$|R

50|$|The Jimbour Dry Stone Wall {{is located}} on the Jimbour Ridge, a low, open, grassy but stony ridge to the north of Jimbour House and is {{constructed}} of scattered volcanic rocks taken from this ridge. Its construction type is a random double wall, being two <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> (walls) of irregularly shaped stones, not laid in courses, which taper inwards. The space between has been filled with smaller stone rubble.|$|R
5000|$|Built at John Buttera's shop, and {{conceived}} by Buttera and body man Louie Teckenoff, {{the car was}} an unusual magnesium monocoque (rather than the more commonplace tube chassis). The body panels were 0.050 in-thick sheet, fastened with adhesives and over 5,000 rivets; the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> were separated by high-density foam. It had full-enclosed front wheels, cockpit, and engine, with a winglet ahead of the front axle and a low wing, just above the rollbar, in back.

40|$|The {{engine fan}} ducts {{used in the}} F 100 fighter are {{titanium}} alloy structures consisting of inner and outer plates (“skins”) and intervening interior “side” walls that connect the two plates and are arranged in a “honeycomb” fashion. The panels are ultrasonically inspected in immersion in pulse-echo or through-transmission modes to look for common defect conditions: interior water in the honeycomb cells, disbonds between the skins and side walls, and tears in the honeycomb side walls. In such C-scan inspections, focussed transducers are used with the beam(s) normal to the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>skins...</b>|$|R
25|$|A fibre {{obtained}} from the leaves is used for making paper. The leaves are harvested in late summer after the plant has flowered, they are scraped to remove the <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> and are then soaked in water for two hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 24 hours with lye and then beaten in a blender. They make a light tan brown paper.|$|E
25|$|Water resistance: The skin {{acts as a}} water {{resistant}} barrier so essential nutrients aren't washed out of the body. The nutrients and oils that help hydrate the skin are covered by the most <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> layer, the epidermis. This is helped {{in part by the}} sebaceous glands that release sebum, an oily liquid. Water itself will not cause the elimination of oils on the skin, because the oils residing in our dermis flow and would be affected by water without the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|The plants {{flower in}} three {{distinct}} colours: white, yellow, and red. The flowers first appear in early May {{through the early}} summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the fruits ripen from August through October. The fruits are typically eaten, minus the thick <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> after chilling in a refrigerator for a few hours. They have a taste similar to sweet watermelon. The bright red/purple or white/yellowish flesh contains many tiny hard seeds that are usually swallowed, but should be avoided {{by those who have}} problems digesting seeds.|$|E
50|$|The great Roman {{development}} in building materials {{was the use}} of hydraulic lime mortar called Roman cement. Previous cultures had used lime mortars but by adding volcanic ash called a pozzolana the mortar would harden under water. This provided them with a strong material for bulk walling. They used brick or stone to build the <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> of the wall and then filled the cavity with massive amounts of concrete, effectively using the brickwork as permanent shuttering (formwork). Later they used wooden shuttering that was removed for the concrete to cure.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the 2008 BMW GINA fabric skinned concept, the ConnectedDrive {{features}} more traditional materials, {{but in an}} equally modern design, referred to by BMW's head of design Adrian van Hooydonk as a 'layered surface'. The front grille maintains the BMW style grille, and {{the front and rear}} lighting monitor the surrounding traffic conditions around the car. The doors are a variation of the 1989 BMW Z1, with the <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> slide florward and the inner door slides backwards. The use of unconventional lighting is integrated into the overall design, from the bonnet area and around the seats to the rear boot lid.|$|R
25|$|Despite finding {{neither the}} {{specific}} wires {{that caused the}} short circuit (the usual cause of arcing sounds and the likely cause of the breaker trips) nor the origin point of the fire that later consumed the plane, investigators determined that a short circuit likely sparked and ignited surrounding materials (such as insulation blankets) that sustained and propagated a fire behind {{the wall of the}} lavatory, with the plane's <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> serving as a conduit for smoke to seep in through the seams in the interior panels and collect near the apex of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{dressing}} in that the limb is unreachable during treatment; the skin under the plaster becomes dry and scaly because the discarded <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> cells are not washed or brushed off. Also, plaster of Paris casts can result in cutaneous complications including macerations, ulcerations, infections, rashes, itching, burns, and allergic contact dermatitis, which may also be due to the presence of formaldehyde within the plaster bandages. In hot weather, staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles and sweat glands can lead to severe and painful dermatitis.|$|E

This work is the basis for investigating and analyzing the field-controllable dynamic properties of a sandwich beam composed of conductive thin <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> and a magnetorheological elastomer core, which will be presented {{in the second part of}} this research...|$|R
25|$|After being sorted, {{washed and}} chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats for preservation/precooking {{and also to}} destroy any {{bacteria}} that could be harmful {{for the rest of}} the processing period as well as for the consumer after production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
25|$|Robonaut2 was {{initially}} {{designed as a}} prototype to be used on Earth. For its journey to the ISS, R2 received a few upgrades. <b>Outer</b> <b>skin</b> materials were exchanged to meet the ISS's strict flammability requirements. Shielding was added to reduce electromagnetic interference and onboard processors were upgraded to increase R2's radiation tolerance. The original fans were replaced with quieter ones to accommodate the station's restrictive noise environment, and the power system was rewired to run on the station's direct current system. Tests were conducted {{to make sure the}} robot could both endure the harsh conditions in space and exist in it without doing damage. R2 also underwent vibration testing that simulated the conditions it would experience during its launch onboard Discovery.|$|E
25|$|Many design {{elements}} of the Sperrin had {{more in common with}} aircraft of the Second World War than those of the new jet age. The design was relatively straightforward in most aspects, with the exceptions of the flight controls and the unusual engine arrangement: The engines were mounted in pairs in nacelles mid-wing, one engine being stacked above the other, for a total of four engines. VX-158 had the distinction of being the first aircraft to receive production Rolls-Royce Avon engines; other engines such improved Avon models and the de Havilland Gyron would also be installed on the two prototypes for test purposes. The airframe was built largely of light aluminium alloys, principally the 75ST alloy; the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> of the aircraft had a highly smooth stressed-skin surface also composed of light alloys, in part due to this, the measured drag was considerably low.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} passage into Mousa is long, {{reflecting the}} enormous thickness of its walls. At its base the broch is 15m in diameter, but {{the interior is}} only 6m in diameter.

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this study}} was the {{analysis}} of the flatwise and edgewise compression response of closed-cell aluminium foam reinforced by the <b>outer</b> <b>skins</b> made of glass fiber reinforced epoxy matrix and the results were compared with those obtained for aluminium foams without glass fiber skins. Aluminium foams were produced by powder metallurgy method. Glass fiber skins were produced in various orientation angles in order to investigate their effects to the efficiency and capacity of absorbing energy of the sandwich. Glass fiber skins were bonded onto the aluminium foam core by epoxy resin in order to fabricate sandwich panels. As a result, the sandwich panels produced has particular importance for transport industries, such as automotive, aerospace, ship structures...|$|R
