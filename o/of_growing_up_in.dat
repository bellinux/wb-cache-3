5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{is an avid}} hockey fan and has {{developed}} a notoriety of being a bandwagon jumper in recent years. Ryan has admitted he was {{a fan of the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, as a result <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the city, but upon taking the Jets head coaching job, he was often seen cheering for all three of the New York metropolitan area franchises. During the New Jersey Devils run to the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, Ryan was seen sporting the team's attire, and he was seen donning the attire of the New York Rangers two years later, during their run to the Stanley Cup Final. Outside of the playoff runs, Ryan performed a ceremonial puck drop at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on October 9, 2010, wearing a vintage New York Islanders Billy Smith jersey.|$|E

25|$|With all {{the focus}} on veterans, the {{children}} are left {{to grow up in}} sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one might think that there would be inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his book (later a movie), The Great Santini.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} one of the most {{anticipated}} releases of 2011 due to the sharp rise in Cole's popularity and mainstream fan base. Cole's lyrics perhaps most strikingly deal with issues such as abortion and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a fatherless household. However, these themes are incorporated alongside more introspective issues such as relationships, family problems, fame and attempting to be successful – an area which very much links in with the subtitle of the album 'The Sideline Story'. Upon its release, the album was generally well received by critics, who praised the wholesomeness of the album.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Coupland resumed {{a visual}} arts {{practice}} dormant since 1989. His is a post-medium practice that employs {{a variety of}} materials. A common theme in his work is a curiosity with the corrupting and seductive dimensions of pop culture and 20th century pop art, especially that of Andy Warhol. Another recurring theme is military imagery, the result <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a military family {{at the height of}} the Cold War. He is represented by the Clark & Faria Gallery in Toronto. In June 2010 he announced his first efforts as a clothing designer by collaborating with Roots Canada on a collection that is a representation of classic Canadian icons. The Roots X Douglas Coupland collection was announced in The Globe and Mail and featured clothing, art installations, sculpture, custom designed art and retail spaces.|$|E

25|$|In Angels {{fourth season}} (2002–2003), Angel is {{rescued from the}} ocean by his former friend Wesley. As Los Angeles {{crumbles}} under the apocalypse, Angel is forced {{to cope with the}} romantic relationship between his son and Cordelia. In order {{to find out more about}} the Beast (Vladimir Kulich) terrorizing L.A., Angel Investigations remove Angel's soul and bring back Angelus after a vision suggests that Angelus has history with the Beast that Angel does not remember. Angelus, however, manages to escape, killing the Beast and wreaking havoc until an old friend, Willow, manages to return his soul for the second time. It is eventually revealed that Cordelia has been possessed by the Beast's master, Jasmine (Gina Torres), a higher power who puts humanity under her thrall in the hopes of achieving world peace. When Angel restores free will and ruins Jasmine's plan, Wolfram & Hart offer him control of their L.A. branch as a reward for putting a stop to world peace. Angel accepts when they agree to rewrite Connor's memories <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> hell, allowing him to live a normal life with a new family. Afterwards, Angel appears in the penultimate and final episodes of Buffy, presenting Buffy with an amulet to help her battle the First Evil.|$|E
500|$|In The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature Nancy Horton called Tunis [...] "the forefather of {{the genre}} of young adult sports fiction". His novels changed the way sports fiction was written, adding depth by {{addressing}} social themes and adolescent issues. Up until his time sports stories focused solely on the games, and treated the athletes as Horatio Alger stereotypes. His stories gave the games context and addressed the pressures and problems <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the spotlight, moving sports {{from the realm of}} pulp magazines to serious fiction.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bruce uses {{elements}} of political hip hop throughout the album. Many of his lyrics {{were derived from}} his experiences <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a poor family that was neglected by the government. He and his brother Robert used to escape from their impoverished reality by gathering themselves in a forest called [...] "Picker Forest". Joe cites [...] "Picker Forest" [...] as a strong influence on the Dark Carnival mythology which began with this album. The themes of the Dark Carnival also derived from a dream Bruce had shortly after the group adopted its new name, in which [...] spirits in a traveling carnival appeared to him.|$|E

500|$|The film's initial {{reception}} was mixed. After {{an advance}} screening on December 31, 1978, Variety magazine praised it, saying that [...] "despite" [...] the [...] "uneasy blend of nostalgia and violence", The Wanderers [...] "is a well-made and impressive film". The Kaufmans were also complimented for their script, which {{was described as}} [...] "accurately" [...] capturing the [...] "urban angst" [...] <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the early 1960s. Janet Maslin, of the New York Times criticized the film in her 1979 review, saying [...] "the movie never attempts to tell a single story" [...] and instead [...] "settles for a string of boisterous vignettes, which are heaped carelessly atop one another without any consistent scheme".|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish. It reminded me <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E
500|$|Director Rebecca Thomas {{was raised}} as a Mormon. She first {{researched}} Mormon fundamentalism for a documentary, {{and the religious}} group portrayed in Electrick Children is based on this research. She {{wanted to write a}} film based on scripture and decided to adapt the story of the Virgin Mary. In writing the script, she drew from her own experience <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Las Vegas and the conflict she perceived [...] "between the traditions of Mormon culture in Utah and the bright lights of Las Vegas". She was also inspired by Pier Paolo Pasolini's [...] "nonjudgmental approach" [...] to religion in The Gospel According to St. Matthew. Thomas began writing the script in April 2011, after her second year of studying at the Columbia University School of the Arts.|$|E

500|$|In 1997 he met author David Hall. [...] Hall {{had been}} raised in the Bradford {{district}} of Manchester and the two swapped tales <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. [...] Hall suggested that Dibnah would be unlikely to have any further television work commissioned on his life and that he should consider becoming a television presenter. [...] The two worked on new ideas for a programme that would show Dibnah touring the country, visiting important historical locations and speaking to the men involved in the maintenance and restoration of industrial machinery and architecture. [...] The programme would also exploit Dibnah's working-class attitude and show him operating some of the machinery he visited. [...] Filming of Fred Dibnah's Industrial Age began in July 1998. [...] The first location was near Bolton, at the Wet Earth Colliery and the crew then moved on to various locations around the country, continuing to film through the summer and autumn of 1998.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Sotomayor {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life. She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work, which was published in January 2013 and titled My Beloved World (Mi mundo adorado in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced. It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times describing it as [...] "a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication." [...] She staged a book tour to promote the work, and it debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller List.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} a Hollywood talent agency Arie Posin had been writing scripts for 10 years, [...] "trying to break in" [...] the film industry, when {{he decided that he}} would rather be a {{director}} than a screenwriter. Posin asked writer Zac Stanford to write the screenplay for The Chumscrubber based on his idea. Because they collaborated on the story, Posin later described the film as [...] "rooted somewhere between" [...] his own memories <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> suburban Irvine, CA and Stanford's upbringing {{in a small town in}} the Pacific Northwest. Posin and Stanford had originally planned to shoot the film with their own money. Posin's girlfriend suggested that he send the script to five producers; one, Lawrence Bender, responded and passed the script on to his partner Bonnie Curtis. Posin and the producers brought the project to around sixty uninterested production companies before sufficient funds for the US$10 million budget were raised and production began.|$|E
