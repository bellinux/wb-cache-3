Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with his father. Tyler Hoechlin, who portrayed Michael Jr., explained, [...] "His dad starts to realize that Michael is all he has now and how much he's been missing.

She also said that while their first album was about finding <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were as everything about recording was new to them, on The Big Room they knew exactly what they wanted, stating [...] "We {{wanted to make a}} 'real' album.

500|$|The {{search for}} a clear and {{distinct}} personal identity is thematically quite closely related {{to that of the}} fragmented self. The quest undertaken by the García sisters for the clarification of their confused identities, however, is an attempt to achieve {{a solution to the problem}} posed by the fragmented self, and thus warrants separate categorization. Scholar William Luis reminds readers of Alvarez that [...] "Yolanda's search for her Dominican identity must be understood within the context of the 1960s in the United States".

500|$|Following Stein's death, his {{assistant}} Alex Ferguson {{agreed to take}} charge of the national team. Initially, this was intended to be a one-off for the friendly that was planned for the free date on 16 October. However, the lack of time available in the lead up to the play-off meant finding a permanent replacement would prove difficult, and so Ferguson was officially appointed on 1 October at least until after the World Cup. While waiting to find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> would play, Ferguson's first game in charge saw the team take on East Germany in a friendly at Hampden Park on 16 October. Their opponents were finally confirmed on 3 November, when Australia beat New Zealand to take an unassailable lead {{at the top of the}} four team Oceania group. Scotland came through the two-legged tie thanks to a 2–0 home win in Glasgow and a 0–0 draw in Melbourne, which saw them become the 24th and final team to qualify for the World Cup Finals in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who is trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways.

500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E

2500|$|For Murray, in {{addition}} to their shared abandonment issues, Lucas's love for literature also appealed to him. Murray had become a fan of the genre during high school, and felt it changed his way of seeing things; it made him rethink his own actions. Lucas has been described as [...] "caught between being charming and a nerd, a hermit and confident". Murray said of the character, [...] "He's very introverted." [...] He described Lucas as an observer, someone who likes to watch people and try to figure <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> really are, as opposed to who they think they are, another aspect similar to Murray's own personality.|$|E

2500|$|The game's main {{theme is}} morality, {{and it is}} the game in the series with the largest focus on philosophy; Uchikoshi intends to have the player's [...] "way of thinking, values, [...] virtues" [...] shaken {{intensely}} while they play the game. The [...] "dilemma" [...] in the game's title reflects this, as the game asks the player whether choices they make are the right thing to do. Another main theme is identity, and how people try to figure <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are. This came from Uchikoshi's personal struggles with identity issues: he said that he is [...] "always thinking about who [...] " [...] and that he thinks he might have a multifaceted personality; his characters, like him, deal with this issue. Among other major themes are [...] "multiple-probability histories", with the player being able to move between different equally probable histories depending on the choices they have made; and the big effects small coincidences can have, which was reflected in the use of randomizing events. The idea to include randomization came from how Uchikoshi wanted to [...] "spoiler-proof" [...] the game, and felt that FAQ websites that tell players how to beat the game make playthroughs uninteresting. He had always been fascinated by the concept of coincidences, and how actions done in the past lead up [...] "where we are today", so he did a lot of research and reading on the topic to prepare writing the story. The theme of no absolute good or evil came from Buddhist literature Uchikoshi had read, particularly the Zen Buddhist idea of [...] "shiki soku zeku", which he described as [...] "matter is void and form is emptiness". Because of this idea, Uchikoshi tried to give each character [...] "their own sense of personal justice that they believe to be true", resulting in characters with different philosophies who play off each other.|$|E
