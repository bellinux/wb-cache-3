40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether shorter {{versions of the}} ADAM test, a screening questionnaire for andropause, provide better diagnostic value than the <b>original</b> <b>tool.</b> Methods. Five thousand and twenty-eight volunteer men aged 50 - 70 years attending a screening campaign for andropause, provided a fasting blood sample and completed the French ADAM test. Logistic regression analysis identified items that best predict andropause defined as serum free testosterone level below 70 ng/l. ROC curves assessed the diagnostic value of modified versions of the ADAM test, obtained by elimination of the less relevant predictors of andropause. Results. Only four items of the ADAM questionnaire {{may account for the}} diagnosis of andropause. These items concerned loss of height, decrease in libido and in enjoyment of life and deterioration in work performance. Item 9 was borderline significant. The area under the ROC curve for the short versions varied slightly from 0. 555 to 0. 560. As expected, model 6 has a greater specificity (56. 02 %) than the <b>original</b> <b>tool</b> while the efficiency increased slightly (54. 85 %). Conclusion. The modified versions of the ADAM test do not provide better diagnostic value than the <b>original</b> <b>tool.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract. The {{realization}} of the handwheel function is a key problem for development of numerical control system of micro milling machine. This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> and often create custom <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> also incorporates a collection of MATLAB scripts that allow the investigator to post process these data in {{a standard}} way, such as automating the processes of noise floor removal, burst start/stop time identification, and mean/median frequency calculation in electromyograms (EMGs). The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> {{has proven to be a}} viable support resource for experimental studies performed by the Kansas State University Human Exercise Physiology lab that target muscle fatigue in human forearms. Initial data acquired during these tests indicate the viability of the system to acquire consistent and physiologically meaningful data while providing a usable <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> for follow-on data analyses...|$|R
