5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>fate</b> based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It {{would not be possible}} for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
