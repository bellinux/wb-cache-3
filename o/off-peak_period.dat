50|$|In 2013, The National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) {{identified}} the arterial, Pennant Hills Road {{as the third}} worst road in NSW and the ACT. This rating reflected the level of frustration experienced by road users. Traffic congestion {{is often associated with}} poor road safety and further compounding congestion into <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> The rate of accidents along the arterial strip was significantly higher when compared to the NSW average. The aim of NorthConnex is to provide a safe, reliable motorway alternative for traffic reducing congestion and the frequency of accidents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a price signal with two settings: off-peak tariff and on-peak tariff. Some loads {{are connected to}} specific electricity meters which allow the consumption of power only in <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Historically, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> were located during the night and on-peak periods during the day. Changing the assignment of <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> is an easy method for distribution system operators to access to the flexibility of small consumers. This solution can be implemented quickly as the infrastructure needed already exists in some countries. We propose a mixed-integer linear model to assign optimally the off-peak hours so as to minimize a societal cost. This cost gathers together the cost of electricity, the financial losses due to energy curtailments of photovoltaic installations and the loads’ wellbeing. Our model considers automatic tripping of inverters and constraints of the electrical distribution networks. Simulation {{results show that the}} new disposition of off-peak hours could reduce significantly the photovoltaic energy curtailed in the summer.

On Saturdays, the Knox Transit Link bus service runs from approximately 4:30 am-1:20 am the next morning, at 12 minute intervals in the daytime, and every 15-20 minutes beyond the 12 minute interval periods. On Sundays, a 12-minute daytime frequency is offered with a 30-minute service in the early morning and at night, with the last service to run from Vermont South at approximately 12:45 am.|$|E

In some places, services on two lines combine to provide more frequent services on common sections of tracks.

Sunday morning services however start later than on Saturdays, and run less frequently until around 10am.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{majority}} of the problems were resolved by Downer EDi, CityRail allowed A3 to commence service, though operating under special conditions.It entered service on 1 July 2011, operating its maiden run from Redfern to Macarthur via the City Circle and Airport. Initially, it operated two return services from the City to Macarthur via the Airport line during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> on weekdays, and all day on the Airport & East Hills and South lines on weekends. On 14 October 2011, A3 became the first Waratah set to operate during peak hours. As more Waratahs became available, the trains were progressively rolled out to most lines of the Sydney suburban network. On 2 June 2014, the State Government announced the final Waratah set (A80) had been delivered.|$|E

30|$|Load {{shifting}} {{technologies are}} those which facilitate moving or shifting existing loads to <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Technologies involved often use process control to modify industrial operations or use electric energy storage or {{thermal energy storage}} for space heating, cooling or domestic water heating.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, the {{marginal}} utility of customer j in period t {{during the peak}} periods is MU_jt^H. If the demand amount is reduced to D_jt^a as the marginal utility decreases, the market will also fall to a new equilibrium E^'. The unmet partial load during the peak periods will shift to the <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> because their relative marginal utility increases during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> MU_jt^L. Therefore, the demand will increase to D_jt^o + ∑_τ tγ_jτ t· DRL_jτ^max· D_jτ^o, where DRL_jt^max is the maximum DR level of customer j in period t and γ_jτ t is the load-shifting rate of customer j from time t to time τ. This reflects that customers’ initiative leads to behaviors that are driven by their marginal utility.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have proposed numerous advanced load scheduling algorithms for smart homes {{with the goal}} of reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In parallel, utilities have introduced variable rate pricing plans to incentivize residential consumers to shift more of their power usage to low-price, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> also {{with the goal of}} reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In this pa-per, we argue that variable rate pricing plans do not incentivize consumers to adopt advanced load scheduling algorithms. While beneficial to the grid, these algorithms do not significantly lower a consumer’s electric bill. To address the problem, we propose flat-power pricing, which directly incentivizes consumers to flat-ten their own demand profile, rather than shift as much of their power usage as possible to low-cost, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Since most loads have only limited scheduling freedom, load scheduling algo-rithms often cannot shift much, if any, power usage to low-cost, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> which are often many hours in the future. In con-trast, flat-power pricing encourages consumers to shift power usage even over short time intervals to flatten demand. We evaluate the benefits of advanced load scheduling algorithms using flat-power pricing, showing that consumers save up to 40 % on their electric bill, compared with 11 % using an existing time-of-use rate plan...|$|R
