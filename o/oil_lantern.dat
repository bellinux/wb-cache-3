60|$|The little low-ceiled cabin {{below was}} rather {{larger than a}} hearse, and as dark as a vault. It had two coffins on each side--I mean two bunks. A small table, capable of {{accommodating}} three persons at dinner, stood against the forward bulkhead, and over it hung the dingiest whale <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes. The floor room unoccupied was not extensive. One might swing a cat in it, perhaps, but not a long cat. The hold forward of the bulkhead had but little freight in it, and from morning till night a portly old rooster, with a voice like Baalam's ass, and the same disposition to use it, strutted {{up and down in}} that part of the vessel and crowed. He usually took dinner at six o'clock, and then, after an hour devoted to meditation, he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night. He got hoarser all the time, but he scorned to allow any personal consideration to interfere with his duty, and kept up his labors in defiance of threatened diphtheria.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. I will not, in presenting--it {{must not}} be called the other side, but the supplementary, and {{wilfully}} omitted, facts, of this ideal,--oppose, as I fairly might, the discomforts of a modern cheap excursion train, to the chariot-and-four, with outriders and courier, of ancient noblesse. I will compare only the actual facts, in the former and in latter years, of my own journey from Paris to Geneva. As matters are now arranged, I find myself, at half past eight in the evening, waiting in a confused crowd with which I am presently to contend for a seat, {{in the dim light}} and cigar-stench of the great station of the Lyons line. Making slow way through the hostilities of the platform, in partly real, partly weak politeness, as may be, I find the corner seats of course already full of prohibitory cloaks and umbrellas; but manage to get a middle back one; the net overhead is already surcharged with a bulging extra portmanteau, so that I squeeze my desk as well as I can between my legs, and arrange what wraps I have about my knees and shoulders. Follow a couple of hours of simple patience, with nothing to entertain one's thoughts but the steady roar of the line under the wheels, the blinking and dripping of the <b>oil</b> <b>lantern,</b> and the more or less ungainly wretchedness, and variously sullen compromises and encroachments of posture, among the five other passengers preparing themselves for sleep: the last arrangement for the night being to shut up both windows, in order to effect, with our six breaths, a salutary modification of the night air.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 the Jaunet {{brothers}} {{illuminated the}} Pyramid with gas, {{using a small}} gasometer. The public, accustomed to the small <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns,</b> was awestruck by the effect.|$|R
60|$|They {{tried to}} follow the light and in doing this became hopelessly lost in the jungle. Then {{one of the boys}} struck one of the <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> on a rock and smashed it, thus doing away with that much of the {{illumination}} they carried.|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1877, the new {{lighthouse}} was 34 ft {{high and}} had an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> with a 5th order Fresnel lens. In 1919 the <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> was replaced with an acetylene light. After it was discovered to be leaning to one side, in 1929 the lighthouse was removed and replaced with an 18 ft steel tower. The old iron lighthouse was transported back to Buffalo where it was later renovated and reinstalled as the East Charity Shoal Light on the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1935.|$|E

50|$|The {{light was}} built by John Clarkson (engineer); Kermack and Gall built the tower, while Smith and Stevenson {{installed}} the <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> which was first lit on 11 August 1797. The light was replaced in 1829 with an argand lamp and silvered reflector. About 1900, it was lit with acetylene. A radio beacon was installed about 1931.|$|E
5000|$|Thady's Lamp: an {{unmanned}} metal lamp tower erected to warn ships {{navigating the}} Shannon of shallow waters. Traditionally lit by <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns,</b> the lamp was replaced {{in recent years}} with solar-powered electric lighting. A second river-based lamp known as the Rock Lamp is also located nearby.|$|R
50|$|Found within all Indian synagogues is {{a central}} bimah (platform where the {{religious}} service is led), a Sephardic Jewish tradition. Other features of Indian synagogues are free-standing wooden benches, a profusion of hanging glass and metal <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns,</b> large shuttered windows with clerestories, a chair for the circumcision ceremony {{and one for the}} prophet Elijah, and separate seating areas for men and women.|$|R
50|$|R.E. Dietz also {{produced}} {{the majority of}} road work warning lights. First <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> (Traffic-Gard trademark) and road torches which looked like cannonballs with large wicks. Kerosene was normally used in these lamps. Later they developed {{some of the first}} transistorized warning lights (Visi-Flash trademark) using standard 6v lantern batteries. These lights either blinked in timed intervals or had a steady light.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, the {{lighting}} and lens assembly was extensively upgraded. A new revolving Fresnel lens (3rd order 375 millimeter f.r. triple flashing catadioptric) was installed. The whale <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> was also {{replaced with a}} 55 millimetre incandescent gas mantle lantern, and fuelled by vaporized kerosene. The lens and lantern were both manufactured by Chance Brothers; {{the total cost of}} these improvements was £1,348 13s ld.|$|E
50|$|Although Browne did {{not make}} {{detailed}} surveys, he gave some measurements, or at least estimates, of size, and described the interiors of the caves in careful detail, {{despite the fact that}} his lighting was very primitive - sometimes a candle, often just an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> which did not always function properly. He would resort to magnesium wire when large chambers had to be illuminated and he regularly provides sketches and plans or sections of some of these.|$|E
50|$|The Halfmoon Reef Light (also Half Moon Reef Light) {{is one of}} {{the many}} screw-pile type lighthouses built on the Texas Gulf Coast, but the only one that still stands. To {{distinguish}} it from the nearby Matagorda Island Light it was given a red glass chimney to be used with the <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> to give it its red beam. Though originally constructed on the bay, the current resting place for the light is on Port Lavaca, alongside Highway 35.|$|E
50|$|Kapetanović {{became the}} mayor of Sarajevo in 1893 {{following}} the 1892 death of the first mayor Mustafa Fadilpašić. The most significant project during Kapetanović's governance was the delivery of electricity to the city. Specifically on 1 May 1895, Sarajevo had, for the first time, electric lighting. Until then, the street lights were <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns.</b> On that same day, Sarajevo {{became one of the}} first European cities to have electric tram trains installed, replacing horse-drawn vehicles.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was quickly}} {{decided that the}} party to go ashore should be {{composed}} of Mr. Rover, Bahama Bill, Aleck, and the three boys. Nearly everybody went armed, and the party carried with them a small electric searchlight, run by a [...] "pocket" [...] battery, and two <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns.</b> They also took with them some provisions, and a pick, a shovel and a crowbar, for Bahama Bill said {{there might be some}} digging to do to get at the treasure.|$|R
25|$|Within a short span of {{his stay}} there, Le Blond {{established}} the first nurseries {{along the banks}} of the Neva and about twenty workshops, specializing in carving, sculpture, stucco work, tapestries, and so forth. He also succeeded in introducing a program of illuminating the main streets with <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns,</b> designed by himself. The architect died suddenly of smallpox in 1719. The tsar himself was present at the funeral, but Le Blond's grave at the St. Sampson cemetery has not survived.|$|R

He puts a record on his record player, breaks an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern,</b> throws the fuel on the heap and lights up a cigarette burning his belongings {{in front of his}} neighbours, while the song of Stratos Dionysiou [...] "Vrehei Fotia Stin Strata Mou" [...] (It's raining fire in my way) plays in the background.|$|E
50|$|Paul {{returns to}} the house the evening before Victor and Elizabeth are to be married at Elizabeth's invitation. Victor shows Paul the revived creature, and Paul {{says that he is}} going to report Victor to the {{authorities}} immediately. During the scuffle that follows, the creature escapes to the castle roof, where it threatens Elizabeth. Victor throws an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> at it, setting it aflame; it falls through a skylight into a bath of acid. Its body dissolves completely, leaving no proof that it ever existed. Victor is imprisoned for Justine's murder.|$|E
5000|$|Around 9:30 p.m., {{with many}} people still trapped in the twisted wreck of the factory, someone accidentally knocked over an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern.</b> Flames raced across the cotton waste and {{splintered}} wood — some of it soaked with oil. [...] One trapped man cut his own throat rather than be consumed by the approaching flames; he was rescued, but died from his other injuries. [...] As the fire grew, rescuers, physicians, families of the trapped victims, and spectators were all driven back by the conflagration. [...] The screams coming from the ruins were soon silenced, leaving rescuers to eventually discover only the burned, smoldering remains of “brick, mortar and human bones … promiscuously mingled”.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{a winter}} riding school was added at the {{northern}} end of the castle site, a summer riding school was situated directly in the castle yard, both castle gardens were adapted (in the Schönbrunn style), and night lighting using <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> was introduced on the access road to the castle {{for the first time in}} history. In 1770, Maria Theresa herself ordered further valuable paintings and furniture to be provided to both the main castle and the Theresianum, and the governor moved into the completed Theresianum. Maria Theresa visited them frequently there, however mostly unofficially.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, the streets of Paris were dark at night, lit only here and there with candles or <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns.</b> In 1662 the Abbé Laudati received royal letters of patent to establish a service providing torch-carriers and lantern-carriers for those who wanted to voyage through the streets at night. Lantern-bearers were located at posts eight hundred steps apart on the main streets, and customers paid five sols for each portion of a torch used, or for fifteen minutes of lantern-light. The company of torch and lantern bearers was in business until 1789.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{lighthouse}} {{built at}} this location was a small, square wooden structure erected in 1872. In 1880 the lighthouse service installed {{a new light}} atop a metal pole in a protective cage. The <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> was lowered by pulleys for service. At {{the turn of the}} century, a steel tower was built for the light and in 1907 the present structure was erected. Named the Holland Harbor South Pierhead Lighthouse, it has a gabled roof that reflects the Dutch influence in the area. The lighthouse, popularly referred to as [...] "Big Red," [...] was automated in 1932. When the U. S. Coast Guard recommended that it be abandoned in 1970, citizens circulated petitions to rescue it. The Holland Harbor Lighthouse Historical Commission was then organized to preserve and restore this landmark.|$|E
5000|$|Louis and Mary {{returned}} to England in 1935 without positions or any {{place to stay}} except Mary's mother's apartment. They soon leased Steen Cottage in Great Munden. This settlement was in Hertfordshire and had an unusual name which Louis, with {{his sense of humor}} noted in his Memoirs, Chapter 5, as [...] "the village of Nasty." [...] They lived without heat, electricity, or plumbing, while fetching water from a well and writing by <b>oil</b> <b>lantern.</b> They lived in poverty for 18 months at this low point of their fortunes, visited at first only by Mary's relatives. Louis gardened for subsistence and exercise and improved the house and grounds. He appealed at last to the Royal Society, who relented with a small grant to continue work on his collection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{light is}} a third-order Fresnel lens with lenses, prisms and {{mechanism}} manufactured in France in 1853. A larger, second-order light had been planned, but delay in shipment caused the present light, originally {{destined for the}} Fort Point Lighthouse in San Francisco, to be installed instead. The first light source was a whale <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> set inside the lens, whose tank the keeper had to climb the tower to fill several times a night. Whale oil was very expensive and was soon replaced by liquified lard oil which gave way to kerosene in 1880. At {{the turn of the}} century, an incandescent vapor lamp was used, followed by electric lights in 1919. From 1912 to 1940 a falling weight mechanism rotated a metal shutter around the light causing the beam to be cut off to seaward for 10 out of every 30 seconds. Thereafter a timed flasher provided the [...] "on/off" [...] characteristic.|$|E
50|$|The {{ski lift}} was {{powered by a}} small private {{hydroelectric}} plant on Fern Creek, as no commercial electricity was yet available. Another private generation facility was established at the Carson's Camp/Silver Lake Resort. The California Electric Power Company finally constructed local distribution lines and established power service to the Loop area in 1946. Prior to that time <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> were used, and refrigeration was accomplished by sawing blocks of ice {{from the surface of}} June Lake during winter, storing them for future use in a large ice house located on shore next to the boat landings.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} solitary and very dull, and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs. I left Charley below {{and went up}} with a light foot, not distressed by any glare from the feeble <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> on the way. I listened for a few moments, and in the musty rotting silence of the house {{believed}} that I could hear the murmur of their young voices. I put my lips to the hearse-like panel of the door as a kiss for my dear and came quietly down again, thinking {{that one of these}} days I would confess to the visit.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a popular}} {{tradition}} {{about the meaning of}} the name of Miziara:There was a beautiful legendary forest. People visited it like we visit ruins and shrines nowadays. A rocky cave in the forest was turned into a niche in the name of Virgin Mary; candles and <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> were always lit. If by chance along the way you met an acquaintance coming from the forest and asked him, where were you? The answer would surely be Min Al Ziara, meaning from the visit to Virgin Mary’s forest. But like all native accents, changing a vocabulary, letters flying into thin air, it became known as Miziara.|$|R
50|$|The monks {{left the}} tower and were {{replaced}} by the first lighthouse keepers in the mid 17th century. In 1671, a new, but still coal burning lantern was installed {{on top of the}} tower to replace the old beacon light. The coal fire was finally abandoned in 1791 when a whale <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> 12 ft. in diameter with 12 lamps was installed. This continued until new gas lights were installed in 1871, lit by gas manufactured in the enclosure known as 'the gas yard'. In the 1860s, three dwellings were built for the lighthouse keepers. Paraffin oil became the source of power in 1911, and a clockwork mechanism changed the light from fixed to flashing. This mechanism had to be wound up every 25 minutes by the keeper on duty. Finally, in 1972 electricity became the power source, and light-sensitive switches were installed to control the lantern. In March 1996, The Hook Lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last light-keepers who had climbed the stairs and tended the light were permanently withdrawn from the station. The lighthouse is now remotely controlled from Dún Laoghaire by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.|$|E
50|$|Quincey pays a {{visit to}} Arthur Holmwood, who {{initially}} rebuff's Quincey's plea for help. Arthur changes his mind after a terrifying dream in which a skeletal Lucy Westenra attacks him. Unable to find Quincey, Arthur turns to Mina to help locate the boy before Dracula can get to him; Mina senses he {{has gone back to}} the Lyceum Theater in order to hopefully get Basarab to help him destroy the Count. During a dress rehearsal, Bathory confronts Basarab and the two duel in a back room of the theater. Bathory outmaneuvers Basarab and smashes an <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> at his feet, catching him and the theater on fire. Quincey arrives to find the theater in flames, and despite his best efforts he cannot find his friend and is forced to escape the theater. Outside Arthur and Mina, who feared Quincey dead, are overjoyed to see him alive although Arthur is suspicious to see that he is completely unharmed. Cotford, who received a message that the key to the Ripper murders would be at the theater, tries to arrest Arthur, Mina and Quincey but Arthur and Quincey manage to escape, while Mina is arrested for the murder of one of Bathory's vampires.|$|E
5000|$|Recipes {{for blue}} light appear in early {{chemistry}} texts and often included antimony or copper compounds meant {{to add a}} blue color, {{but by the time}} of the American Civil War, standard military texts listed recipes for blue light which lacked any such coloring agent. While the generic moniker [...] "blue light" [...] was retained, the pyrotechnic signal was meant to burn with a vivid, white light. Modern authors have been confused by the generic name of blue light, and have imagined incorrectly that the signal which was seen during the Hunley - Housatonic encounter was blue. The <b>oil</b> <b>lantern</b> which archeologists at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center recovered from the Hunley submarine has a clear, not a blue, glass lens, further evidence which discounts the modern [...] "blue lantern myth" [...] of the Hunley. Blue light as made in 1864 has been reproduced according to the two recipes listed in period texts and has been tested with success over the same distances involved in the Hunley engagement. Two YouTube videos demonstrate the manufacture and use of such blue light: [...] "Burning Blue Light" [...] and [...] "Making Civil War - Era Blue Light" [...] are the videos which show the signal as seen in 1864.|$|E
2500|$|.....the general alarms went off, and we {{were getting}} all the {{passengers}} out, getting everybody up on deck. It was blowing, the seas were starting to smack {{against the side of}} the ship, it was pitch black. And pretty soon we could see little bobbing lights along the shoreline, little <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> so we obviously stirred up the natives. As it got lighter we could see that we had ripped out the bottom almost clear back to the engine room. There was a lot of oil, and it oiled the sea and the beach. There was no backing off, so we had to get the passengers ashore. We lowered the lifeboats with people in them.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} {{evidence}} that the site was probably inhabited as far back as 2000 BC, the beginnings of urban civilization can certainly {{be traced back to the}} 2nd century BC when there were bronze-working shops at the site. In the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the oppidum had become a civilized community trading with other Gallic centres. The Treveri nobles appear to have occupied the dwellings at the centre of the plateau. The Celtic tombs excavated in the vicinity, specifically at Clemency, at Scheierheck near Goeblange and at Kreckelbierg near Nospelt contain a range of articles including wine flagons, spurs, knives, lances and <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> testifying to the aristocracy of those buried.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 and 1909, with {{permission}} of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, William Collins moved his small dredge to {{the eastern part of}} the Newport bay, a mud flat called [...] "Snipe Island", and begin cutting a channel along the north side of the bay across from the Pavilion, piling the sand and silt up on the mud flat and thus Balboa Island was born. Balboa Island was a summer vacation place. Most homes had no heaters, and were closed up in the winter. Families came down for the entire summer. Cooking was done on a gasoline stove as there was no gas or electricity. Coal <b>oil</b> <b>lanterns</b> and candles were used.|$|R
