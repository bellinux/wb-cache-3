5|$|Fearing {{that she}} might be Kerner's next target, Indy travels to New York City in order to warn her and {{to find out more about}} the mysterious statue. There, he {{interrupts}} her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia's apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal <b>orichalcum,</b> and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.|$|E
5|$|Using ten <b>orichalcum</b> beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an {{impending}} catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

25|$|Poseidon carved the {{mountain}} where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular moats of increasing width, varying {{from one to}} three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from {{the mountain}}, making a route {{to the rest of}} the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with brass, tin, and the precious metal <b>orichalcum,</b> respectively.|$|E

A persistent feature was the inflationary debasement and replacement of coins over the centuries. Notable examples of this followed the reforms of Diocletian. This trend continued into Byzantine times.|$|E

50|$|<b>Orichalcum</b> or aurichalcum is a metal {{mentioned}} in several ancient writings, including {{the story of}} Atlantis in the Critias of Plato.

5000|$|<b>Orichalcum</b> is also {{mentioned}} in the Antiquities of the Jews - Book VIII, sect. 88 by Josephus, who stated that the vessels in the Temple of Solomon were made of <b>orichalcum</b> (or a bronze that was like gold in beauty).

Pseudo-Aristotle in De mirabilibus auscultationibus describes a type of copper that is [...] "very shiny and white, not because there is tin mixed with it, but because some earth is combined and molten with it." [...] This might be a reference to <b>orichalcum</b> obtained during the smelting of copper with the addition of [...] "cadmia", a kind of earth formerly found on the shores of the Black Sea, which is attributed to be zinc oxide.|$|E

50|$|Augustus more {{comprehensively}} reformed denominations {{below the}} denarius. New ratios were fixed among the currencies: the sestertius was now minted from about {{an ounce of}} <b>orichalcum,</b> an alloy of copper and zinc, rather than silver, and fixed at {{a quarter of a}} denarius. The dupondius, formerly a two-pound bronze coin, was now <b>orichalcum,</b> valued at half a sesterius and weighing half as much. The half-ounce as, worth half a dupondius, the semis, worth half an as, and the quadrans, worth half a semis, were the first pure copper coins minted in Rome since 84 BC.|$|E

50|$|ARCAM Corporation is {{a company}} that was founded in the United States and has {{branches}} covering all countries from across the globe. Its mission is to covertly secure and destroy all ancient artifacts (items, machines, ruins, etc.) from all known enemies that may use them for their own benefit. Its breakthrough was the refinement of <b>Orichalcum,</b> a strong metal that was used for ARCAM's Armored Muscle Suit and Yu's combat knife. MJ-12 and Trident Corporation were able to refine their own <b>Orichalcum</b> suits, mostly from ARCAM's research. The spelling ARCAM {{is said to be a}} misspelling of Arkham.|$|E
50|$|With the coinage {{reform of}} Augustus in about 23 BC, the sestertius and dupondius were {{produced}} in a golden colored copper-alloy called <b>orichalcum</b> by the Romans and numismatists, and Latin brass by us, while lower denominations were produced out of reddish copper. However, some dupondii were made entirely from copper under Augustus, while under subsequent Nero some aes {{were made from}} both <b>orichalcum</b> and copper, instead of only copper for aes coined until then. Therefore, the latter can only be distinguished from dupondii by their smaller size instead of by also {{the appearance of the}} metal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Orichalcum</b> was considered, by weight, to {{be about}} double the value of copper. This is why the half-sestertius, the dupondius, was around {{the same size and}} weight as the bronze as, but was worth two asses.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orichalcum</b> has {{variously}} {{been held}} to be a gold/copper alloy, a copper-tin or copper-zinc brass, or a metal no longer known. However, in Virgil's Aeneid the breastplate of Turnus is described as [...] "stiff with gold and white orichalc".|$|E
5000|$|The Romans transliterated [...] "orichalcum" [...] as [...] "aurichalcum," [...] {{which was}} thought to {{literally}} mean [...] "gold copper".

Namor and his allies were then left to die on his trawler by torpedo; Namor took action in having everyone quickly board the Dorma and escape before the torpedo destroyed the trawler. Namor later rescued Stark following the destruction of Von Strucker's airship fleet, as (in Namor's words) Stark owes him a boat for the destruction of his.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Needham {{notes that}} the 18th century Bishop Richard Watson, a {{professor}} of chemistry, wrote of an ancient idea that there were [...] "two sorts of brass or orichalcum".

50|$|<b>Orichalcum</b> {{may have}} been a noble metal such as platinum, as it was {{supposed}} to be mined, or one type of bronze or brass or possibly some other metal alloy.

50|$|In 2015, {{a number}} of ingots {{believed}} to be <b>orichalcum</b> were discovered in a sunken vessel (in the coasts of Gela in Sicily), which has tentatively been dated as being 2600 years old.
