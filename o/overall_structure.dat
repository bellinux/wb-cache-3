5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's <b>overall</b> <b>structure.</b> The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an <b>overall</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of June23, Andres {{weakened}} to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable air mass. The system began to rapidly degenerate, as convection became dislocated from {{the center and the}} <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> of Andres degraded. By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> from {{traditional}} Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics.

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled and began {{weakening}} {{to the southeast}} of Bermuda on September15, spawning a low-pressure area by September18. A stationary wind circulation developed around the low by September19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection developed into narrow banding features far from the center, and the <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} {{to organize and}} deepen as the nascent depression continued west-northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. However, dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters proved deleterious to the system, and the circulation became more disorganized on October30. Despite the marginally favorable conditions, the <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> improved on November1, with pronounced outflow developing along the western periphery. A nearby buoy reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed the increasing organization. At 03:00UTC on November1, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and 24hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. By that time, the agency estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph) while the storm was just 150km (95mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00UTC on November2.|$|E

5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for a day as it tracked north-northwestward, eventually dissipating 70mi (110km) south-southwest of Bahía Asunción on July 26.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hours after}} {{becoming}} a hurricane, Earl further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale; this observation {{was based on}} a flight-level winds of 119mph (192km/h), which corresponded to surface winds of 100mph (155km/h). The storm did not feature an eye or partial eyewall. The central barometric pressure continued to fall {{despite the fact that the}} storm was beginning to weaken. Around 0000UTC on September3, the central pressure decreased to 985mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg); however, winds also decreased to 90mph (150km/h). As Earl neared landfall, cloud tops significantly warmed, indicating weakening, and the <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> of the storm became less organized.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the 2001 India cyclone {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} disturbance over the Arabian Sea on May18. The following day, the system was determined to be relatively stationary near the island of Socotra. Although deep convection was associated with the disturbance, {{there was no evidence of}} a low-level circulation. By May20, the disturbance slowly moved towards the southeast in response to an upper-level trough over India. The <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> gradually improved as good outflow developed. A mid-level circulation finally developed late on May21, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Several hours later, they began monitoring the system as a tropical depression with the identifier 01A; however, operational advisories were not issued until the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity. By the morning of May22, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) also took notice of the system.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Delia {{originated}} from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased and the <b>overall</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the system}} improved. By August31, a weak {{area of low pressure}} formed over the Gulf of Honduras. This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on September1. Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September3 as it turned towards the west. In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia. This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone.|$|E
