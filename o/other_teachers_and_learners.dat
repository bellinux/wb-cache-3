40|$|ABSTRACT Teaching and {{learning}} are frequently treated as {{processes that are}} separate from each <b>other,</b> while <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> are considered as disembodied entities with a neutral position towards the content which is negotiated. In collective biography writing (CBW), a very different approach is taken. Writing, reading {{and learning}} are seen as an integrated whole, where <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> educators and students participate in the same practice(s) and context(s), thus learning through a collaborative approach, with a particular focus on themselves as learners (teachers as well as students). In this article, a memory story example is used to show {{the process of being}} a subject and of being subjected in a social context. The example provides opportunities to become aware of how social forces work when the individual is socially approved and positioned. It is argued that the use of CBW as a methodological tool, informed by post-structural theory, is useful in learning processes that aim at revealing underlying social forces. The method supports critical reflection and opens up space for becoming more aware of differences and the construction of our ‘selving’...|$|R

40|$|The South African {{education}} system prior to 1994 was characterised by hierarchical management structures with top-down communication systems. After 1994, {{there was a}} policy call to shift leadership and management practices to more democratic ways of working. These policies required the principals to share their power with teachers, replacing the leader-follower system of leadership. The post-apartheid era in the South African {{education system}} marked a turning point where, in policy discourse at least, teachers were seen as leaders, opening the doors for teacher leadership. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the enactment of teacher leadership in a township secondary school in the province of the Eastern Cape. It also sought to investigate the factors that enhanced or hindered this leadership enactment as teachers operated as leaders in their natural setting. Under the umbrella of distributed leadership as a theoretical framework, the research study was located within the interpretive paradigm and a qualitative case study was adopted. Three teacher leaders at the case study school were my primary participants. Data collection methods included interviews, questionnaires, observations, self-reflective journaling and telephonic conservations. I used Grant’s Model of teacher leadership as my analytical tool. My findings indicated that teacher leadership was enacted in all the zones of teacher leadership but to varying degrees. My teacher leaders enacted leadership in Zone 1 where they showed strong leadership in the classroom. They also enacted leadership in Zone 2 and 4 where they showed leadership in working with <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> outside the classroom in curricular and extra-curricular activities as well as in other neighbouring schools. However, in Zone 3 the School Management Team (SMT) controlled most of the leadership and management activities. Teacher leaders were not included in decision-making in this zone as the SMT thought that it was their sole duty. Teacher leadership in this school was thus characterised as ‘restricted’ following the characterisations of teacher leadership by Harris & Muijs (2007). Using Gunter’s (2005) categories of distributed leadership, I categorised the case study school as an example of authorised distributed leadership...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. Traditionally South African Schools are characterised by the {{hierarchical}} {{nature of their}} management structures. The principal {{is the head of}} the school and is accountable to the Department of Education. Post 1994 school management teams are in place in schools and membership includes the principal, deputy principal and HOD‟s who hold the formal management positions. Teachers who are not formally appointed to leadership positions are categorized as level-one teachers. Hence, this dissertation works from the premise that these teachers play an important role as leaders, albeit in an informal capacity. These teachers play an important role as leaders, albeit in an informal capacity. Teacher leadership enactment is prevalent in South African Schools, but to varying degrees. Every teacher is a potential teacher leader and therefore every school has an immense wealth of expertise in terms of teacher leadership. However, within the context of their environments, human resources are utilized to varying degrees in the different schools. The research questions which guided this study included: “How is teacher leadership enacted in an urban primary school?” and “What factors promote or hinder this enactment?” The study was designed as a case study which was conducted within the interpretive paradigm and was mainly qualitative in nature. Data were gathered by means of survey questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, a focus group interview, journal entries and observation schedules. The case study was of an urban primary school in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data were predominantly qualitative and were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings of the study were that teacher leadership enactment occurred across all four zones, mostly in zone one (in the classroom) and zone two (working with <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> outside the classroom in curricular and extra-curricular activities). Teacher leadership enactment was very restricted in zone three (outside the classroom in whole school development). Enhancing factors included that there was shared decision-making, a collaborative learning environment and delegation of duties from an informal position. 4 The main barriers were a lack of dialogic space, an overemphasis on control by the SMT and lack of time to enact teacher leadership...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{computer}} technology in English language teaching and learning is accepted, often uncritically, in many settings, even though in other settings, computers are not available, while in still <b>other</b> settings, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> often lack the necessary computer literacy skills to exploit the technology effectively for language learning and teaching. While many articles and books discuss tips for using computer-bases technologies in the classroom, research studies tend to be small scale and seldom generalizable.

40|$|Masters Research thesisThe last 20 {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the introduction {{and the development of}} `Western' language teaching methods in the Chinese context. A large amount of research has been conducted on this iss�e. Some focuses on the appropriateness and the effectiveness of importing the "Western" methods to the teaching of English as a foreign language in China (Scovel 1983; Burnaby & Sun 1989; Cortazzi & Jin 1996); <b>others</b> suggest <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> from different cultures may have different ideas about what constitutes good teaching (Richards & Lockhart 1994). The present study reports on the results of an investigation into Chinese EFL teachers' and learners' perceptions concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of Western language teaching methods in use in the Chinese. context. In particular, it attempts to explore their attitudes towards and their evaluation of learner-centred communicative activities in use in their English Intensive Reading classes. The major findings of this study is that, first, both <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> understand learner-centred <b>and</b> communicative language teaching well and hold positive attitudes towards the Western methods, which make it possible and feasible to introduce and implement communicative approach in China. They are also aware of the difference between the Western and the Chinese contexts and point out that adaptation is necessary when introducing the Western methods to the Chinese context. Secondly, this study also finds a mismatch between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> in terms of their understanding of and attitudes towards Western methods. Learners seem to be more positive than their teachers to welcome learner-centred communicative approach, which is far beyond their teachers' anticipations. This indicates the importance of negotiation between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> in Chinese EFL classes. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{challenges}} in distance education is motivational issues that distance learners encounter because of the factors such as separation in time <b>and</b> space from <b>teachers,</b> <b>other</b> <b>learners,</b> <b>and</b> learning sources. In an effort to minimize this drawback and increase learners’ participation into learning processes by motivating distant learners, new approaches such as gamification have been integrated in distance education. Gamification {{is one of the}} motivational approaches to meet this need.   Gamification is defined as the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game situations to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals. Within this perspective, this study intends to explain the use of gamification by examining, SoruKüp, a gamified web-based quiz application designed for the use of distant learners. Within this context, the research used holistic multiple-case design {{which is one of the}} qualitative research model. The research data was collected through interviews with participants who used SoruKüp application and the data was analyzed using content analysis technique. Within the perspectives of the research, it has been argued that gamification in distance education enhances the learners’ motivation, contributes to the sustainability of the learning process, and makes the learning process more fun...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. Sexuality {{education}} is a controversial subject, which gave rise to many heated debates about whether sexuality education should be taught in schools. Many studies found that parents, although the primary educators of sexuality, were abdicating this very important responsibility. This led to their children seeking information from their peers and the media. A few children turned to their teachers whom they could trust. With the increase in teenage pregnancies, child rape and HIV/AIDS, the Minister of National Education, Prof. Kader Asmal, advocated that sexuality education should be taught in schools and not left solely to the parents. Hence, he mandated the implementation of sexuality education in schools in 2002. One of the vital components of sexuality {{education is}} teaching children about relationships, not specifically sexual relationships but relationships with significant others. An extensive literature survey revealed {{that there was a}} paucity of research in this area. Hence, this study investigated the influence sexuality education in schools was having on Grade 7 learners' relationships with parents, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> peers. <b>Learners</b> needed to communicate with their parents, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> peers on matters pertaining to sexuality as they experienced it, in order to improve their relationships. Schools were expected to use the whole school policy approach in implementing sexuality education in order to fortify the learners' relationships with others. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find out if implementing sexuality education in schools was improving learners' relationships with significant others. Indian <b>and</b> Black <b>learners</b> from two schools in Tongaat, KwaZulu-Natal, were selected to participate in the study. Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire and selected semi-structured interviews. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results revealed that many learners were turning to same gender <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> Life Orientation <b>teachers</b> to talk to on matters pertaining to sexuality. However, they expressed feeling uncomfortable and shy when discussing sexuality related issues, especially with parents, <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> opposite gender <b>learners.</b> Most of the learners preferred confiding in their mothers or female teachers on issues regarding sexuality. It was also found that boys and girls preferred to be separated during sexuality education sessions because they felt more at ease with their own gender peers. Overall, it was found that the whole school policy approach to teaching sexuality education was not very successful, as reflected in the variable responses to the influence of sexuality education on learners' relationships with others. The findings of this study led to the following recommendations being made to the Department of Education: engaging in more intensive workshops to promote the whole school policy approach to teaching sexuality education in schools; devising a proper monitoring system to check the implementation of sexuality education in schools; engaging female Life Orientation <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> screening sexuality education teachers. As the relationship between Life Orientation <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> appeared to be positive, Life Orientation teachers could serve as facilitators to bridge the gap amongst all relevant stakeholders involved in the learners' education regarding sexuality. <b>Other</b> <b>teachers</b> could improve their relationship with learners by trying to integrate sexuality education into their learning areas, which would allow learners to develop rapport and trust with them when discussing sexuality issues. Most importantly, a suggestion was made to parents to form a partnership with schools to strengthen their relationships with their children. Children are bound to communicate more effectively with their parents about sexuality if they see their parents liaising with the schools and showing an active interest in their progress. Finally, it must be noted that this study is not without limitations. The chosen sample was not representative of the entire population of KwaZulu-Natal. Therefore the results cannot be generalised. This study was also limited racially to Indian <b>and</b> Black <b>learners...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Constructive {{communication}} practices between {{secondary school}} <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> play {{an essential role}} in the relationships, support of development <b>and</b> self-actualisation of <b>learners.</b> Learner development is facilitated via teacher-learner interaction {{in the context of a}} healthy relationship. In my master’s dissertation (Prins, 2009 : 85 - 87) I describe that learners sometimes experience a rigid attachment of the teacher to his or her own perspective and role as sender during communication. In essence, this type of communicative interaction is associated with a breakdown in true communication. It is basically a refusal by the teacher to respectfully engage and authentically listen to the learners in their care. I call this mode of interaction a parallel-monologue. The experience of this parallel-monologue seems to represent an important dimension of the experience of disrespect during the communication between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> <b>and</b> also inhibits the development of an authentic supportive and constructive educational relationship between a <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> a <b>learner.</b> The refusal, by the teacher, to listen respectfully to the learners in their care is characterised by a psychological atmosphere where there is a lack of mutual respect, a negative intrapersonal experience, and an absence of important principles of effective <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner</b> interactions. The experience is associated with low trust, frustration and aggression. Such a mono-logical communication approach is unsatisfactory. An approach to <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner</b> communication interactions that fails to incorporate constructive communication, in the form of respectful dialogue, is strongly associated with learners’ experience of aggression during communication interactions with teachers. Constructive communication between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> in a secondary school is an essential element of healthy <b>learner</b> development <b>and</b> self-actualisation.

Personal leadership in essence endeavours to guide an individual to personal mastery and focuses on three important questions, which will provide individuals with greater clarity namely: • Who am I? • Where do I {{want to go with}} my life? • How will I do this? Our schools are characterised by <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> with a low morale and negative emotional problems. The emotional problems experienced in our schools are evident from media reports on suicidal tendencies, stress, depression <b>and</b> aggressiveness by <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners.</b> <b>Teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> do not understand their emotional reactions and are unaware of strategies to manage their emotions, {{as well as those of}} others. Emotional leadership is one of the areas where <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> can benefit from the dynamics of personal leadership. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of emotional leadership in the school context. In order to realise this aim, a conceptual analysis of emotional leadership was conducted in chapter two. The essay is based on a literature study and the following steps were employed: library searches on words and concepts related to emotional leadership; research on authoritative sources, including consultation with books and journals. The outcome of this conceptual analysis was a definition of emotional leadership. Self-awareness, managing emotions appropriately, motivating oneself and others, empathy and handling relationships and managing emotions in others well, were described as the components of emotional leadership. Chapter three focussed on the importance of emotional leadership in a school context. Guidelines for the application of emotional leadership in a school context were formulated at the end of chapter three. The following findings were formulated as guidelines for the application of emotional leadership in a school context: • <b>Teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> are encouraged to make proactive choices for their lives and not blaming others for their circumstances. • In order to experience emotional security <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> are encouraged to have a clear vision of the future. • <b>Teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> should perceive themselves more positively to improve their self-image. • <b>Teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> should develop a very strong sense of humour to assist them to get rid of negative emotions and increase their empathy and tolerance levels. • Leading a life of honesty and integrity will ensure emotional security for <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners.</b> • <b>Teachers</b> should continuously listen to their learners with empathy in order to enhance the self-confidence and self-esteem of their learners...|$|R

The discussions were recorded with an audio tape and the data were transcribed and analyzed searching for common themes and divergent views. The findings indicate that <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> perceive healthpromotion {{as an integral part of}} education. However they recognized the limitations of implementing a comprehensive health promoting programin the school. Students also highlighted the importance of being consulted when health programs are planned for them in schools. Teachers supported the importance of policy formulation to guide the implementation of a comprehensive health promoting program. The outcomes of the study therefore suggest that there is a need to create awareness for all concerned - <b>teachers,</b> <b>learners,</b> parents <b>and</b> the wider community, of the importance of health promoting programs in schools. Further research is also suggested to explore attitudes of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> in the successful implementation of health promoting programs...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{inspired}} by the scarcity of research into the practical implementation of peer assessment in Serbian EFL classrooms. Hence, the study explores the attitudes of Serbian EFL <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners</b> on peer assessment and compares {{the results of an}} assessment experiment in which the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> students had the task to assess speaking performance according to the predefined speaking assessment guidelines. The research consisted of three parts. The first part included 112 teachers taking part in the questionnaire, while the second part comprised 130 primary and secondary students filling in the relevant survey. The third experimental part involved 24 students <b>and</b> 15 <b>teachers</b> as evaluators, <b>and</b> 5 students as presenters, i. e. the assessed speakers. The results showed generally positive attitudes towards peer assessment both among <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>learners,</b> with certain reservations underpinned in the study. The assessment experiment results point to the overall agreement of <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner</b> scores, which emphasizes the importance of peer assessment incorporation as relatively reliable classroom assessment practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{face-to-face}} {{learning can}} benefit from a rich technological infrastructure functioning in real time. We have conceived, developed and used a software system, ANTS, Automated Notes Transfer System, which supports traditional pedagogic activities in an institution of higher education. ANTS resides as client and server on the personal computers of the <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner,</b> typically laptops brought temporarily into the lecture theatre. ANTS uses the wireless data communications network pervading the theatre <b>and</b> allows the <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner</b> to share educational material stored on the Internet. ANTS ensures the learner accesses {{the current version of}} the educational material. ANTS also allows the <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>learner</b> to collaborate in modifying the material as the learning activity progresses. <b>Teacher</b> <b>and</b> leaner can add, delete, and change text and graphics in response to discussion. Our use of ANTS confirms that it encourages learner-directed events during the activity. It also helps the learner in the cognitive domain of learning styles and facilitates group learning...|$|R
