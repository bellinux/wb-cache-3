5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>products</b> is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl {{group at the}} end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E
