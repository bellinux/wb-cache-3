5|$|The Naval Air Station {{closed in}} May 1944. On 18 June 1944 one hundred seventy seven men and four {{officers}} of Company B, 91st Naval Construction Battalion (Seabee), arrived from Milne Bay to dismantle station's buildings and facilities, removeing and crating over 5,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> equipment and loading it aboard ship before departing 31 August 1944 and {{their return to}} Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>and</b> in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E

5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board apartment {{blocks of the}} Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen as}} an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage of diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> forms.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, steering components, drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic companies could {{set up their own}} production. The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles. The original, calculated price per vehicle had been 765,000marks but the eventual cost was 800,000marks.|$|E

An American technical team evaluated the ship's condition on 8 October and deemed her a constructive total loss. Junyō was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.|$|E

25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved {{to be more of a}} problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E
