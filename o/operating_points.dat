40|$|The giant magneto-impedance (GMI) {{magnetic}} sensor {{based on the}} amorphous wire has been believed to be tiny dimensions, high sensitivity, quick response, and small power consumption. This kind of sensor is usually working under a bias magnetic field that is called the sensor’s <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> However, the changes in direction and intensity of the external magnetic field, or the changes in sensing direction and position of the sensor, will lead to fluctuations in <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> when the sensor is working without any magnetic shield. In this work, a GMI sensor based on the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> self-regulator is designed to overcome the problem. The regulator {{is based on the}} compensated feedback control that can maintain the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> of a GMI sensor in a uniform position. With the regulator, the GMI sensor exhibits a stable sensitivity regardless of the external magnetic field. In comparison with the former work, the developed <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> regulator can improve the accuracy and stability of the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> and therefore decrease the noise and disturbances that are introduced into the GMI sensor by the previous self-regulation system...|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{the power}} system is linearized at an <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> and the {{controller}} is {{designed so that}} the system <b>operates</b> at that <b>point.</b> If the system deviates far from the <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> severe non-linearities are introduced and the conventional controller may lose its control over the system.|$|R
50|$|Also {{in case of}} an {{unstable}} <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and outer friction as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point. Running at {{an unstable}} <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is therefore undesirable.|$|R

The effective bandwidth function evolved out of large deviations theory, establishes the crucial connection between the node <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> and the theory of statistical network calculus. This paper uses the concepts of effective bandwidth and effective capacity to describe independent stochastic arrival and service processes, respectively, and to identify node <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> to perform stochastic analysis with network calculus. The two main advantages of the approach used in this paper are: (i) the use of <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> to perform stochastic analysis provides insight into the queue dynamics, and (ii) the use of effective bandwidth and effective capacity functions {{within the framework of}} statistical network calculus allows efficient evaluation of performance bounds.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for Photovoltaic (PV) Panels Based on T-S type Fuzzy Systems. The PV panel model structure is represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) type fuzzy system. It is described by four local models. Each of them is characterized by an optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> The power generated by the PV panel depends on the temperature and irradiation. An algorithm based on T-S fuzzy systems is proposed to extract the maximum power generated by the PV panel. The optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> for the PV panel is computed based on the optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> for each local model. A Boost dc-dc converter has been connected between the PV panel and the load to allow the <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> to be varied. The duty cycle for the converter is computed based on the coordinates of all the local models of the PV panel. The <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> is thus optimally tracked based on the MPPT algorithm. Some simulations have been done to check the performance of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with the design and its simulation studies of a modified extremum seeking control for nonlinear systems. A standard extremum seeking control has a simple structure, but {{it takes a long time}} to reach an optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point.</b> We consider a modification of the standard extremum seeking control which is aimed to reach the optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> more speedily than the standard one. In the modification, PD acceleration term is added before an integrator making a principal control, so that it enables the objects to be regulated to the optimal point smoothly. This proposed method is applied to Monod and Williams-Otto models to investigate its effectiveness. Numerical simulation results show that this modified method can improve the time response to the optimal <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> more speedily than the standard one.
