50|$|Brothers Pallade and Simon Violet, {{itinerant}} drapers from Thuir (France), {{decided to}} take advantage of the wine fever in the region to develop an <b>apéritif</b> <b>wine</b> flavored with cinchona. They mixed dry wines and mistelles and initially marketed the resulting product as a health drink or tonic. This was because the local apéritif producers were displeased about competition with their established brands. Rebranding the brothers' aperitif as a health drink got around this problem, and Byrrh was sold in pharmacies.|$|R

25|$|The method {{generally}} produces wines {{that are}} highly aromatic with low alcohol content, sometimes as low as 6%. The wines are sometimes somewhat obscure from remaining lees.

High-quality wines produced with the ancestral method, often by small growers using organic farming principles, can be complex and very distinctive. They are mainly used as <b>aperitifs</b> or dessert <b>wine</b> with fruit dishes.|$|R
