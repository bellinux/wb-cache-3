40|$|The main {{features}} in iron-based superconductors would be (i) the <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>transition</b> accompanied by remarkable softening of shear modulus, (ii) high-Tc superconductivity {{close to the}} orthorhombic phase, and (iii) nematic transition in the tetragonal phase. In this paper, we present a unified explanation for them, based on the orbital fluctuation theory, considering both the e-ph and the Coulomb interaction. It is found that a small e-ph coupling constant (λ 0. 2) is enough to produce large orbital (=charge quadrupole O_xz/yz) fluctuations, which causes the s-wave superconductivity without sign reversal (s_++-wave state). The derived orbital fluctuations also cause the instability toward the structure transition due to the bound state formation of two orbitons with opposite momenta, which is called the "two-orbiton process". Moreover, impurity-induced non-local orbital order with C_ 2 -symmetry is obtained when the orbital fluctuations are strong. This "impurity-induced nematic state" explains the in-plane anisotropy of resistivity in detwinned samples. We stress that (i) -(iii) are reproducible only when orbital fluctuations with respect to O_xz and O_yz charge quadrupoles are the most divergent.

40|$|The main {{features}} in iron-pnictide superconductors are summarized as (i) the <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>transition</b> accompanied by remarkable softening of shear modulus, (ii) high-Tc superconductivity {{close to the}} orthorhombic phase, and (iii) stripe-type magnetic order induced by orthorhombicity. To present a unified explanation for them, we analyze the multiorbital Hubbard-Holstein model with Fe-ion optical phonons based on the orbital fluctuation theory. In the random-phase-approximation (RPA), a small electron-phonon coupling constant (λ 0. 2) is enough to produce large orbital (=charge quadrupole) fluctuations. The most divergent susceptibility is the O_xz-antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) susceptibility, which causes the s-wave superconductivity without sign reversal (s_++-wave state). At the same time, divergent development of O_x 2 -y 2 -ferro-quadrupole (FQ) susceptibility is brought by the "two-orbiton process" {{with respect to the}} AFQ fluctuations, which is absent in the RPA. The derived FQ fluctuations cause the softening of C_ 66 shear modulus, and its long-range-order not only triggers the orthorhombic structure transition, but also induces the instability of stripe-type antiferro-magnetic state. In other words, the condensation of composite bosons made of two orbitons gives rise to the FQ order and structure transition. The theoretically predicted multi-orbital-criticality presents a unified explanation for abovementioned features of iron pnictide superconductors. Comment: 19 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

40|$|The SrFe 2 As 2 -xPx and CaFe 2 As 2 -yPy {{materials}} were prepared by a solid state reaction method. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate the single-phase samples can be successfully obtained for SrFe 2 As 2 -xPx and CaFe 2 As 2 -yPy samples. Clear contraction of the lattice parameters are clearly determined {{due to the}} relatively smaller P ions substation for As. The SDW instability associated with tetragonal to <b>orthorhombic</b> phase <b>transition</b> is suppressed visibly in both systems following {{with the increase of}} P contents. The highest superconducting transitions are respectively observed at about 27 K in SrFe 2 As 1. 3 P 0. 7 and at about 13 K in CaFe 2 As 1. 7 P 0. 3. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, 2 table...|$|R
