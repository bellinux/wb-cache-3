5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} <b>occupancy</b> simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under current law, that <b>occupancy</b> could {{not be viewed as}} {{undertaken}} with the implied consent of the government, as was the <b>occupancy</b> in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual <b>occupancy</b> rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E

The double <b>occupancies</b> are obtained from the equations of motion of the single-particle Green's function. Our calculations show that the approximate double <b>occupancies</b> can become negative. This is a shortcoming of approximate, and yet conserving, many-body self-energies.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method to calculate the <b>occupancies</b> of single particle levels in atomic nuclei. This method has been developed {{in the context of}} the microscopic interacting boson model, in which neutron and proton degrees of freedom are treated explicitly. The energies of the single particle levels constitute a very important input for the calculation of the <b>occupancies</b> in this method. In principle these energies can be considered as input parameters that can be fitted to reproduce the experimental <b>occupancies.</b> Instead of fitting, in this study we have extracted the single particle energies from experimental data on nuclei with a particle more or one particle less than a shell closure. We provide the sets of these single particle energies suitable for several major shells and apply our method to calculate the <b>occupancies</b> of several nuclei of interest in neutrinoless double-β decay using these sets. Our results are compared with other theoretical calculations and experimental <b>occupancies,</b> when available...|$|R

5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the <b>occupancy</b> of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their <b>occupancy,</b> and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
