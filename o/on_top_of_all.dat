5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen {{made the mistake}} of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but did manage to rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that {{a large part of the}} city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians {{had to pay}} a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped {{sponsor the}} {{building}} of Peterborough Square {{with the aid of}} the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an Eaton's store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the Ministry of Natural Resources to 300 Water Street, kitty corner from Peterborough Square.

25|$|In 2004, the {{production}} of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than {{the production}} of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas. When evaluating costs, fossil fuels are generally used as the reference. The energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort and so has no cost assigned to it. Only the extraction, refining, transportation and production costs are considered. On the other hand, the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured, and so has a significant cost, <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the costs of refining, transportation, and distribution. Systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly, for example in trolleybuses, or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant economic advantage because there are fewer conversion processes required between primary energy source and point of use.|$|E

500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

2500|$|After being cleaned, the wila is {{traditionally}} cooked in a pit. [...] The pit {{is traditionally}} quite large, 1 to 3 m across and 60 to 90cm deep. [...] A fire is lit in the pit, and numerous rocks are heated {{up on the}} fire until they are very hot. [...] Some people sprinkle some dirt over the rocks {{after they have been}} heated up. [...] Then a thick layer of wet vegetation (perhaps moss, fern fronds, skunk cabbage leaves, bark, grass, or conifer needles) is used to cover the rocks and line the pit. [...] The wila is piled on top of this vegetation, almost always with layers of root vegetables or other food. [...] The lichen is then covered with more wet vegetation. [...] Often a barrier of large leaves, bark, reed mats, or burlap sacks is placed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the vegetation to stop any detritus from falling into the food.

2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got in on the action. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors.

Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to be <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the latest fashion trends in Europe."
