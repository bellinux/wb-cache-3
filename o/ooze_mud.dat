These stratigraphic units defined using diatoms are correlated with radiolarian abundance stratigraphy (Cycladophora davisiana) and with palaeomagnetic stratigraphy.

I like the twilight of the long grey street, sad with the wailing cry of the distant muffin man. One thinks of him, as, strangely mitred, he glides by through the gloom, jangling his harsh bell, as the High Priest of the pale spirit of Indigestion, summoning the devout to come forth and worship.

40|$|We analyse surface {{sediment}} and its {{distribution in}} Flandres Bay, West Antarctic Peninsula, {{in order to}} understand modern day sediment dispersal patterns in a fjord with retreating, tidewater glaciers. The surface sediment descriptions of 41 cores are included in this study. The sediment facies described include muddy diatomaceous <b>ooze,</b> diatomaceous <b>mud,</b> pebbly mud, sandy mud and mud, with scattered pebbles present in most samples. In contrast to a traditional conceptual model of glacial sediment distribution in fjords, grain size in Flandres Bay generally coarsens from the inner to outer bay. The smallest grain size sediments were found in the bay head and are interpreted as fine-grained deposits resulting from meltwater plumes and sediment gravity flows occurring close to the glacier front. The middle of the bay is characterized by a high silt percentage, which correlates to diatom-rich sediments. Sediments in the outer bay have a high component of coarse material, which is interpreted as being the result of winnowing from currents moving from the Bellingshausen Sea into the Gerlache Strait. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of glacial environments often use grain size as an indicator of proximity to the ice margin. After a detailed analysis {{of a large number of}} cores collected in the study area, our findings highlight the variability in sedimentation patterns within a fjord and provide a valuable evidence of the complexity that may occur in the sedimentary record...|$|R
60|$|While she {{was going}} back to England, Grandcourt was coming to find her; coming, that is, after his own manner--not in haste by express {{straight}} from Diplow to Leubronn, where she was understood to be; but so entirely without hurry that he was induced by the presence of some Russian acquaintances to linger at Baden-Baden and make various appointments with them, which, however, his desire to be at Leubronn ultimately caused him to break. Grandcourt's passions were of the intermittent, flickering kind: never flaming out strongly. But a great deal of life goes on without strong passion: myriads of cravats are carefully tied, dinners attended, even speeches made proposing the health of august personages without the zest arising from a strong desire. And a man may make a good appearance in high social positions--may be supposed to know the classics, to have his reserves on science, a strong though repressed opinion on politics, and all the sentiments of the English gentleman, at a small expense of vital energy. Also, he may be obstinate or persistent at the same low rate, and may even show sudden impulses which have a false air of daemonic strength because they seem inexplicable, though perhaps their secret lies merely in the want of regulated channels for the soul to move in--good and sufficient ducts of habit without which our nature easily turns to mere <b>ooze</b> and <b>mud,</b> and at any pressure yields nothing but a spurt or a puddle.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} ambitious goals of the Seismogenic Zone Experiment (SEIZE) is to {{discriminate}} between the effects of changing intrinsic frictional strength (i. e., gouge versus wall-rock) {{and the effects of}} gradual or transient increases in pore pressure within fault zones. In subduction zones, both variables are likely to change with increasing distance down the plate boundary. In addition to sediment’s cohesion and coefficient of internal friction, the shear strength of any given stratigraphic interval depends upon fluid pressure and total normal stress. The release of fluids from mudstones during diagenesis (including volatiles generated from organic matter) is modulated by a combination of mechanical compaction, tectonic consolidation, and mineral reactions. Thus, it is essential to determine how permeability, sediment-derived fluid sources, and fluid flow contribute to overpressure conditions within the subduction inputs, beginning seaward of the subduction front at depths of 2500 m or less. Primary lithostratigraphic architecture exerts a first-order influence over the material properties and tectonic behavior of subduction zones, at least near the toe of the margin wedge. Generic sedimentary facies models for trenches (Piper et al., 1973) show upward thickening and coarsening trends (from basalt at the base through pelagic <b>ooze,</b> hemipelagic <b>mud,</b> silty turbidites, and sandy turbi-dites). As glaring exceptions to that norm, however, there are substantial thicknesses of highly permeable sand (abyssal-plain deposits) that continue to move down the subduction path (i. e., beneath the frontal décollement) in Nankai (Ashizuri transect), Barbados, and Cascadia (Underwoo...|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the Pliocene and Quaternary basin fill in the Gulf of California is composed of relatively fine-grained mud turbidites which have sedimentary structures that are more subtle than those of sandy turbidites in flysch deposits. Basal contacts are sharp, sometimes accompanied by thin, laminated, muddy sands; the silty body commonly appears massive, and the tops consist of a thin zone with faint burrow traces. The composition, physical properties, tex-tures, and sorting of biogenic components document graded intervals. The composition of these beds reflects source areas ranging from thick, hemipelagic diatom ooze blankets to muddy delta foreslopes. In the Guaymas Basin, these sources lead to two end member types: I, Pale olive to moderate olive brown, nannofossil-bearing diatom <b>ooze</b> to <b>mud,</b> cm-to-decimeter thick; and II, dark to medium olive gray to medium gray, terrigenous, silt-rich muds, from decimeters to over 12 meters thick, with low percentages of biogenic components. Type I is probably redeposited from intrabasinal bathyal slope regions, whereas Type II represents more distal transport from outer, muddy deltaic slopes. The tops of some Type I beds are pure diatom ooze layers, the result of hydraulic sorting. In core sections recovered undisturbed by the hydraulic piston corer, mass physical property gradients for turbidites (water content, wet-bulk density, porosity, shear strength, and shrinkage) are clearly distinguished from the host sediment by their higher bulk densities and lower porosities. Basal parts of turbidites have the lowest porosities but are highly permeable and so function as conduits for pore fluids and are sites for early silica and carbonate diagenesis. This type of mud turbidite facies, commonly with intercalated mud flows, is found in the internal tectonic zones of many orogenes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTR,XCr: Scanning {{electron}} microscopy {{was used to}} study finely pulverized skeletal material extracted from typical Cincinnatian limestones as well as micritic regions within slabs of associated limestones. Samples were observed at magnifications ranging from 3, 000 X to, 330, 000 X. Fibrous, platy and lamellar organic structures were recognized in the less than 55, ~ size range both in the pulverized, particulate samples and in the micritic regions of limestone slabs. Although micrite may be polygenetic, {{at least part of}} the micrite included in the sampled limestones was derived by the comminution of skeletal material. I NTRODUCTION The term micrite was introduced by Folk (1959) as an abbreviation for microcrystalline calcite <b>ooze</b> or <b>mud</b> which may form an im-portant orthochemical constituent of limestones. Folk (1965) found the most common modal size of micrite 1) etween 1. 5 and 2 /z and suggested that micritic limestones have undergone por-phyroid neomorphism, with the dominant mode of the resulting microspar falling between 5 and 6 #. Flugel, Franz, and Ott (1968) provide an excellent review of electron microscope studies of limestones, and point out that the grain size of micrite ranges mostly between 0. 3 and 10 tu. Flugel, Franz, and Ott (1968) also report that the predominant frequency maximum for micrite occurs below Folk's (1959) upper size limit of 3. 5 V., and that 80 percent of all grains in micritie limestone have diameters below 3. 5 ~. haas-much as some provision seems necessary for grain diameters in excess of 3. 5 ~ (Flugel, Franz, and Oft, 1968), all microcrystalline calcite ooze in the 5,a and less size range is considered as micrite in the present study. The origin of micrite is a problem not fully resolved. Its formation has been ascribed to physico-chemical precipitation (Black, 1933), biochemical precipitation (Lalou, 1957), corn minution of skeletal material (Folk, 1962; Mat...|$|R

40|$|Six {{sites were}} drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 135 {{in the western}} Lau backarc basin in the {{southwest}} Pacific (Sites 834 – 839). These sites are all located in basins within a horst and graben terrain and form an approximate transect across the rifted arc basement onto crust considered to have been formed at the East Lau Spreading Centre. The sedimentary sequences recovered from these backarc sites {{range in age from}} the late Miocene to the Holocene; they consist primarily of a lower succession of volcaniclastic sediment gravity-flow deposits interbedded with hemipelagic clayey nannofossil oozes and nannofossil clays, overlain by a distinctive upper succession of hydrothermally stained hemipelagic, and locally redeposited, clayey nannofossil oozes. The volcaniclastic sediment gravity-flow deposits are predominantly massive, proximal, vitric gravels, sands and silts, that are mainly locally derived from adjacent basement ridges and intrabasin seamount volcanoes. At Site 835, which was drilled in a small extensional sub-basin in the oldest part of the Lau Basin, the upper clayey nannofossil ooze sequence is anomalously thick and rigorous sedimentological analysis shows that much of this sequence is redeposited. Thick clayey nannofossil <b>ooze</b> turbidite <b>muds</b> are identified that closely resemble the enclosing clayey nannofossil ooze hemipelagites. These thick turbidite muds are associated with mudclast conglomerates, interpreted as muddy debris-flow deposits, and a number of coherent rafted blocks of older hemipelagic sediment. These allochthonous deposits testify to several episodes of instability in the sub-basin that may be related to large-scale tectonic activity caused by the southward passage of ocean-ridge propagator tips past the latitude of the drillsite. Episodes of increased sediment deposition, due to increased frequency of turbidite emplacement, are evident at all of the Lau Basin backarc drillsites, and these correlate moderately well with the closest approach of the propagating ridge tip to each sub-basin. The research presented illustrates how turbidites, once identified, can be used to decipher complex tectonic histories, and demonstrates the importance of local tectonic controls on sediment redeposition in backarc basins...|$|R
40|$|I PEER {{out into}} the dawn mist. It is snowing softly and the sea is flat calm. Then they appear, three great grey shapes {{cruising}} powerfully alongside our ship. They take steady short breaths, briefly engulfing us in a fishy cloud of steam, then turn and dive under the hull. "A-frame in!" shouts Josh into his radio, and the whine of hydraulics snaps {{me out of my}} whale-watching trance. Above, the bright orange confusion of steel struts and levers that is our precious box-corer swings wildly on its tether. Dave DeMaster, chief scientist, gives me a timely reminder to stop staring out to sea and to "haul in the tag lines". The swing is brought under control and we land the corer gently onto the deck. "Good core!" he shouts. We whoop with excitement. Our combined efforts have brought yet another beautifully undisturbed lump of green deep-sea mud onto the deck. Magazine Myself and 16 other scientists from around the world are aboard the Antarctic research vessel Laurence M. Gould. The rugged mountains and ice sheets of the Antarctic Peninsula, just 50 kilometres away, contrast with the fertile seas we have come so far to study. During the summer months, bathed in sunlight 24 hours a day and fed by deep-water nutrients, these waters support a teeming array of marine life. But in the winter, the sunlight is gone and the energy pump that is the Sun's rays is switched off. Nowhere else in the world is this seasonal effect more dramatic, {{and this is what we}} have come to study. Two months previously, I was explaining to friends back home that I was off to Antarctica. "Wow!" they would exclaim: "What are you doing there ? Studying penguins, or killer whales, perhaps ?" "Er, no. Worms actually," I would reply enthusiastically. "They are amazingly diverse in the Antarctic and no one has worked out how they feed in the winter. Part of our project is to [...] . " At this point their eyes would glaze over and I knew the conversation was over. But marine worms, the diverse group known scientifically as polychaetes, are the subject of the PhD thesis that I am working on at the Natural History Museum, London. So when Craig Smith of the University of Hawaii invited me to join him on an Antarctic research trip I jumped at the opportunity to collect some more. And of course, if there just happened to be a side order of humpback whales breaching, beautiful ocean sunsets, penguins leaping off icebergs and teeming fur-seal colonies, then they would be a welcome bonus. So here I am found, on the back of a heaving ship, shovelling thick, <b>oozing</b> <b>mud</b> from one bucket to another. Our "box corer" is cleverly designed to bring back an undisturbed section of the seabed 500 metres below. Once on board, the job of sorting the mud from the animals falls to that endless source of cheap labour that is the PhD student. But I am soon rewarded with plenty of wriggling polychaete worms. Craig has estimated that there may be up to 20 000 per square metre of seabed, a density possibly unmatched elsewhere in the world. Under the microscope, a wondrous variety of forms is revealed. Giant pink and purple scavenging scale worms dwarf tiny burrowing types. Predatory "glycerid" polychaetes extrude their tiny jaws from mouthparts that are almost as long as the worm itself. An agitated "phyllodocid" polychaete swims aggressively around the Petri dish, laying thousands of tiny pink eggs as it moves. They do not live for long. Having survived a huge change in water pressure, it is the heat that finally kills them. Soon I add formaldehyde preservative and the rest are quickly finished.

We can {{experiment}} repeatedly, knowing there is a limitless free supply. One {{of the most basic}} elements of the earth, mud allows us to develop an appreciation for the environment as we experience its diversity. As adults we can continue to enjoy the sensory experience of mud through mud baths, mud facials, gardening, and barefoot walks with <b>mud</b> <b>oozing</b> through our toes. This is the story of an early childhood program staff’s decision to share the joys of mud with children through the creation of a mud center. The provocation It all began at a staff meeting of the lab school at the University of Montana—Western campus. This community of learners includes children ages three through eight, parents, staff, and college students earning early childhood degrees. At this particular meeting, 18 staff and students immersed themselves in fond recollections from childhood. Some of us visualized these in our minds, others wrote about them in journals, and still others drew pictures. When it came time to share, we were amazed to find that our favorite memories revolved around a common element—unstructured time spent playing outdoors. Many of us recalled sensory, messy, creative activities. For several, mud was the medium of choice. W...|$|R
40|$|During Leg 177 of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), a well-preserved middle Eocene {{to lower}} Miocene {{sediment}} record was recovered at Site 1090 on the Agulhas Ridge in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean. This new sediment record shows evidence of a hitherto unknown late Eocene opal pulse. Lithological variations, compositional data, mass-accumulation rates of biogenic and lithogenic sediment constituents, grain-size distributions, geochemistry, and clay mineralogy are used to gain insights into mid-Cenozoic environmental changes and to explore {{the circumstances of the}} late Eocene opal pulse in terms of reorganizations in ocean circulation. The base of the section is composed of middle Eocene nannofossil oozes mixed with red clays enriched in authigenic clinoptilolite and smectite, deposited at low sedimentation rates (LE 2 cm/ka). It indicates reduced terrigenous sediment input and moderate biological productivity during this preglacial warm climatic stage. The basal strata are overlain by an extended succession (100 m, 4 cm/ka) of biosiliceous <b>oozes</b> and <b>muds,</b> comprising the upper middle Eocene, the entire late Eocene, and the lowermost early Oligocene. The opal pulse occurred between 37. 5 and 33. 5 Ma and documents the development of upwelling cells along topographic highs, and the utilization of a marine nutrient- and silica reservoir established during the pre-late Eocene through enhanced submarine hydrothermal activity and the introduction of terrigenous solutions from chemical weathering on adjacent continents. This palaeoceanographic overturn probably was initiated through the onset of increased meridional ocean circulation, caused by the diversion of the Indian equatorial current to the south. The opal pulse was accompanied by increased influxes of terrigenous detritus from southern African sources (illite), mediated by enhanced ocean particle advection in response to modified ocean circulation. The opal pulse ended because of frontal shifts to the south around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, possibly in response to the opening of the Drake Passage and the incipient establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Condensed sediments and a hiatus within the early Oligocene part of the section possibly point to an invigoration of the deep-reaching Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The mid-Oligocene to lower Miocene section on long time scale exhibits less pronounced lithological variations than the older section and points to relatively stable palaeoceanographic conditions after the dramatic changes in the late Eocene to early Oligocene...|$|R
60|$|At noon {{the next}} day, Tallente, nervously {{as well as}} {{physically}} exhausted with the long climb from the Manor, turned aside from the straight, dusty road and seated himself upon a lichen-covered boulder. He threw his cap on the ground, filled and lighted an old briar pipe, and gazed with a queer mixture of feelings across the moorland to where Woolhanger spread itself, a queer medley of dwelling house and farm buildings, strangely situated {{at the far end}} of the table-land he was crossing, where the moor leaned down to a great hollow in the hills. The open stretch of common which lay between him and his destination had none of the charm of the surrounding country. It was like a dark spot set in the midst of the rolling splendours of the moorland proper. There were boulders of rock of unknown age, dark patches of peat land, where even in midsummer the <b>mud</b> <b>oozed</b> up at the lightest footfall, pools and sedgy places, the home and sometimes the breeding place of the melancholy snipe. Of colour there was singularly little. The heather bushes were stunted, their roots blackened as though with fire, and even the yellow of the gorse shone with a dimmer lustre. But in the distance, a flaming carpet of orange and purple stretched almost to the summit of the brown hills of kindlier soil, and farther round, westwards, richly cultivated fields, from which the labourers seemed to hang like insects in the air, rolled away almost to the clouds.|$|R
2500|$|A Beechcraft Model 18 {{had landed}} on the runway at Cape Gloucester in January, {{followed}} by a C-47. Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of Alamo Force, inspected the airstrip with Brigadier General Frederic H. Smith, Jr., on 9 January 1944. They estimated that the 8th Fighter Group could move in as early as 15 January. This did not prove feasible; the airbase was not yet complete, and transport aircraft bringing in much-needed supplies overtaxed its limited facilities. The 35th Fighter Squadron arrived on 13 February, followed by the 80th Fighter Squadron on 23 February. Heavy rains made <b>mud</b> <b>ooze</b> up through {{the holes in the}} steel plank, making the runway slick. This did not bother the 35th Fighter Squadron's nimble and rugged P-40 Kittyhawks, but the P-38 Lightnings of the 80th Fighter Group found themselves overshooting the short runway. Major General Ennis C. Whitehead, the commander of the Fifth Air Force's [...] Advanced Echelon (ADVON), decided to move the 8th Fighter Group to Nadzab, and replace it with RAAF squadrons from Kiriwina equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks. No. 78 Wing RAAF began moving to Cape Gloucester on 11 March. No. 80 Squadron RAAF arrived on 14 March, followed by No. 78 Squadron RAAF on 16 March, and No. 75 Squadron RAAF two days later. No, 78 Wing provided close air support for the 1st Marine Division ashore, assisted the PT boats offshore, and proved vital air cover for convoys headed to the Admiralty Islands campaign. Operations were maintained at a high tempo until 22 April, when No. 78 Wing was alerted to prepare for Operations Reckless and Persecution, the landings at Hollandia (Jayapura) and Aitape.|$|R
50|$|Hammerberg's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a diver engaged in rescue operations at West Loch, Pearl Harbor, 17 February 1945. Aware of the danger when 2 fellow divers were hopelessly trapped in a cave-in of steel wreckage while tunneling with jet nozzles under an LST sunk in 40 ft of water and 20 ft of mud. Hammerberg unhesitatingly went overboard in a valiant attempt to effect their rescue despite the certain hazard of additional cave-ins and the risk of fouling his lifeline on jagged pieces of steel imbedded in the shifting mud. Washing a passage through the original excavation, he reached the first of the trapped men, freed him from the wreckage and, working desperately in pitch-black darkness, finally effected his release from fouled lines, thereby enabling him to reach the surface. Wearied but undaunted after several hours of arduous labor, Hammerberg resolved to continue his struggle to wash through the <b>oozing</b> submarine, subterranean <b>mud</b> in a determined effort to save the second diver. Venturing still farther under the buried hulk, he held tenaciously to his purpose, reaching a place immediately above the other man just as another cave-in occurred and a heavy piece of steel pinned him crosswise over his shipmate in a position which protected the man beneath from further injury while placing the full brunt of terrific pressure on himself. Although he succumbed in agony 18 hours after he had gone to the aid of his fellow divers, Hammerberg, by his cool judgment, unfaltering professional skill and consistent disregard of all personal danger in the face of tremendous odds, had contributed effectively to the saving of his 2 comrades. His heroic spirit of self-sacrifice throughout enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|R
40|$|Reliable dating of glaciomarine sediments {{deposited}} on the Antarctic shelf since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is challenging {{because of the}} rarity of calcareous (micro-) fossils and the recycling of fossil organic matter. Consequently, radiocarbon (14 C) ages of the acid-insoluble organic fraction (AIO) of the sediments bear uncertainties {{that are difficult to}} quantify. Here we present the results of three different methods to date a sedimentary unit consisting of diatomaceous <b>ooze</b> and diatomaceous <b>mud</b> that was deposited following the last deglaciation at five core sites on the inner shelf in the western Amundsen Sea (West Antarctica). In three cores conventional 14 C dating of the AIO in bulk samples yielded age reversals down-core, but at all sites the AIO 14 C ages obtained from diatomaceous ooze within the diatom-rich unit yielded similar uncorrected 14 C ages between 13 51756 and 11 54347 years before present (a BP). Correction of these ages by subtracting the core-top ages, which probably reflect present-day deposition (as indicated by 210 Pb dating of the sediment surface at one core site), yielded ages between ca. 10 500 and 8400 cal. a BP. Correction of the AIO ages of the diatomaceous ooze by only subtracting the marine reservoir effect (MRE) of 1300 a indicated deposition of the diatom-rich sediments between 14 100 and 11 900 cal. a BP. Most of these ages are consistent with age constraints between 13. 0 and 8. 0 ka for the diatom-rich unit, which we obtained by correlating the relative palaeomagnetic intensity (RPI) records of three of the sediment cores with global and regional reference curves. As a third dating technique we applied conventional radiocarbon dating of the AIO included in acid-cleaned diatom hard parts extracted from the diatomaceous ooze. This method yielded uncorrected 14 C ages of only 511138 and 510638 a BP, respectively. We reject these young ages, because {{they are likely to be}} overprinted by the adsorption of modern atmospheric carbon dioxide onto the surfaces of the diatom hard parts prior to sample graphitisation and combustion for 14 C dating. The deposition of the diatom-rich unit in the western Amundsen Sea suggests deglaciation of the inner shelf before ca. 13 ka BP. The deposition of diatomaceous oozes elsewhere on the Antarctic shelf around the same time, however, seems to be coincidental rather than directly relate...|$|R
40|$|Late Holocene (c. 2100 yr BP) varved sediments {{recovered}} from Saanich Inlet, Ocean Drilling Program Leg 169 S, have been analyzed using high resolution {{scanning electron microscope}} techniques. The individual centimetre-scale varves comprise two segments: a biogenic varvesegment which consists of up to 19 alternating diatom <b>ooze</b> and diatomaceous <b>mud</b> laminae, which were deposited during spring through autumn; and a terrigenous varve-segment containing up to 6 laminae dominated by silty clay, which were deposited during winter. The laminae within the varves record individual flux events of {{a few weeks to}} months duration. Diatom flux typically reached the fjord floor as a mixture of whole/fragmented aggregates and Zooplankton faecal pellets. The diatom succession within the biogenic varve-segment typically comprises: an early spring Thalassiosira spp. bloom, followed by a late spring Chaetoceros spp. -dominated bloom, a late spring/early summer Skeletonema costatum bloom and a series of one to several summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. -dominated blooms. Interannual variability in diatom sediment flux is typically recorded by the presence/absence of Thalassiosira spp., S. costatum and the number of summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. - dominated blooms. The varved sediment documents a major increase in the sedimentation rate at approximately 2100 varve yr BP. This represents a transition from a colder/drier climate during the Tiedmann glacial advance when sediment flux was lower, to a relatively warmer/wetter late Holocene climate when sediment flux increased. As glaciers receded, fluvial input increased throughout the year as a result of increased rainfall during winter months and glacial meltwater during spring through autumn months. This increased fluvial input introduced additional terrigenous sediment throughout the year and additional nutrients enhancing diatom production during spring through autumn. The varved sequence is punctuated by centimetre-scale massive intervals originating from low density turbidity currents initiated above the anoxic zone. A tephra laminae containing volcanic glass has also been observed and might originate from Mount St Helens. Spectral analyses of inter-varve variability in sediment fluxes have shown strong periodicities within El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) bands. Thalassiosira spp. flourished in the more stable conditions associated with strong La Nina-type phases of the ENSO cycle. S. costatum blooms were associated with El Nino events when winter storms increased levels of ground water storage, which subsequently increased fluvial input of nutrients during the late spring/early summer. The summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. blooms were dominated by the NPO, as successive years of increased rainfall/snowfall associated with the colder/wetter NPO regime increased long term mean levels of ground water storage and accumulation of snow, which subsequently increased fluvial input of nutrients during summer and autumn months. Winter terrigenous flux was dominated by NPO at Site 1033 and ENSO at Site 1034. Site 1033 which is the most distal to the terrigenous source, records increased/decreased fluvial input associated with the wetter/dryer regimes of NPO. Site 1034, records the effects of El Nino storms which rework nearshore sediments and deposit them in the deeper offshore regions. QBO frequencies are recorded in the overall sediment flux and biogenic sediment flux at Site 1033 and may represent the alternation of a relatively weaker/s"tronger Aleutian Low Pressure System causing consecutive years to be relatively wetter and drier, affecting sediment fluxes. ENSO operated at approximately 3. 5 years, with stronger events occurring at approximately 9 year intervals; QBO operated at approximately 2. 4 years; and NPO operated at approximately 15 years. Multi-decadal periodicities of 31 and 42 years are also recorded and might represent stronger NPO regimes...|$|R
