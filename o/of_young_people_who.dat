5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E

Among her most prized collections were many of the volumes of the Heinemann African Writers Series. Other frequent visitors to the house included the traders who brought her the goldweights they had acquired on their collecting trips through the villages and towns of Ghana. She also took an interest in the education and welfare of a number <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> became part of her extended family, among them Isobel Kusi-Obodom, whose father died in Nkrumah's prisons, and Dr Joe Appiah-Kusi of Seattle.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{to certain}} Spanish and Portuguese Jews (Western Sephardi Jews), the Dor Daim {{rejected}} the Zohar, {{a book of}} esoteric mysticism. They felt that the Kabbalah {{which was based on}} the Zohar was irrational, alien, and inconsistent with the true reasonable nature of Judaism. In 1913, when it seemed that Rabbi Qafiḥ, then headmaster of the new Jewish school and working closely with the Ottoman authorities, enjoyed sufficient political support, the Dor Daim made its views public, and tried to convince the entire community to accept them. Many of the non-Dor Deah elements of the community rejected the Dor Deah concepts. The opposition, the Iqshim, headed by Rabbi Yiḥya Yiṣḥaq, the Hakham Bashi, refused to deviate from the accepted customs and from the study of the Zohar. One of the Iqshim's targets in the fight against Rabbi Qafiḥ was his modern Turkish-Jewish school. Due to the Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute, the school closed 5 years after it was opened, before the educational system could develop a reserve <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had been exposed to its ideas.|$|E
25|$|During {{those years}} the Dominican Republic had only {{seven months of}} true democracy, under the {{presidency}} of Juan Bosch from February 1963. When a military coup overthrew Bosch, the country began a tumultuous period which by 24 April 1965 saw {{the start of the}} Dominican Civil War. Military officers had revolted against the provisional Junta to restore Bosch, whereupon U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, under the pretext of eliminating Communist influence in the Caribbean sent 42,000 U.S. troops to defeat the revolt in Operation Power Pack, on 28 April. The provisional government, headed by Héctor García-Godoy, announced general elections for 1966. Balaguer seized his chance, once he had the backing of the United States government, returning to the Dominican Republic with the purpose of destroying the popular groups that had participated in the rebellions of 1965. These groups of rebels consisted <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wanted change, who understood that Balaguer was no better than Trujillo. He formed the Reformist Party and entered the presidential race against Bosch, campaigning as a moderate conservative advocating gradual and orderly reforms. He quickly gained the support of the establishment and easily defeated Bosch, who ran a somewhat muted campaign out of fear of military retribution.|$|E

Azerrad wrote, [...] "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to." [...] In its citation placing it at number 17 in its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone said, [...] "No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator."

500|$|The {{film was}} {{especially}} appreciated by filmmakers and film critics {{associated with the}} French New Wave movement. André Bazin said [...] "as a conventional love story, the film {{could have been a}} success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of drame gai, and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public." [...] Film critic Claude Beylie called it [...] "the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties...The Rules of the Game is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy." [...] It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was [...] "the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had at the cinema";and [...] Louis Malle, who said [...] "for all of us, my generation of French filmmakers, La Regle du jeu was the absolute masterpiece." [...] François Truffaut articulated the film's enormous influence and said [...] "it isn't an accident that The Rules of the Game inspired a large number <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers." [...] He also said [...] "It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, {{to the extent that it}} ultimately became a true commercial success." ...|$|E
