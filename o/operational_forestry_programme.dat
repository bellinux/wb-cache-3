To put the subject in context the paper commences by showing the areas under forest in Ireland and other EC countries. There follows a brief history of forestry in Ireland from the beginning of the 17 th century to the present time. We next examine recent developments in forestry including the introduction of the current <b>forestry</b> <b>operational</b> <b>programme</b> and the problems of achieving the planting targets. The next section deals with the impact of forestry on rural areas with particular emphasis on land use and rural employment. This is followed by a section dealing with the economics of private planting. The paper concludes with a discussion on supply and demand trends for timber, and Irish trade in wood and wood products...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to highlight the}} importance of urban <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> as an element of urban planning. Urban forestry must be integrated into urban planning for control of air pollution and for the aesthetic improvement of the human environment. Trees act as filters for airborn pollutants including particulate matter. The paper {{emphasizes the importance of}} the selection of tree species based on their tolerance to pollutants as determined by their Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI). The Paper also deals with results of studies on urban <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> in Mysore city and the scope of urban forestry in polluti on control and bioaesthetic planning. As much as we need clean cities we also need beautiful cities. A city which is clean may appear drab and monotonous without tree lined avenues and parks. Selection of trees for aestheatic planning of cities should be based on height. growth form. flowering season. etc. The growth from of trees becomes aft important factor for selection of tree species for planting in parks. public buildings. industrial sites. educational institutions and residential areas.

40|$|Nepal has a {{long history}} of {{returning}} public forests to local people as part of its community <b>forestry</b> <b>programme.</b> In principle the community <b>forestry</b> <b>programme</b> is designed to address both environmental quality and poverty alleviation. However, concern has been expressed that forest policies emphasise environmental conservation, and that this has a detrimental impact on the use of community forests in rural Nepal where households require access to public forest products to sustain livelihoods. To study the effect of government policies on forest use, an economic model of a typical small community of economically heterogeneous households in Nepal was developed. The model incorporates a link between private agriculture and public forest resources, and uses this link to assess the socioeconomic impacts of forest policies on the use of public forests. Socioeconomic impacts were measured in terms of household income, employment and income inequality. The results show that some forest policies have a negative economic impact, and the impacts are more serious than those reported by other studies. This study shows that existing forest policies reduce household income and employment, and widen income inequalities within communities, compared to alternative policies. Certain fores...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{community}} forestry {{has emerged}} as a means to reform power constellations with regard to forest governance. Through community forestry, the central state promised to devolve several forest rights to local communities and encouraged them to get involved in decision making processes and the implementation of forest activities. However, experience in some countries indicates that the implementation of community <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> is rarely followed by genuine power devolution to local forest users. Instead, these programmes may even serve as a means to retain or restore the central state’s control over forests. Using a case study of a community <b>forestry</b> <b>programme</b> implemented in Java, Indonesia, by a state forest company, this paper argues that the implementation of community forestry is also driven by the state’s interests to regain control over the forests. Research in eight villages in Central Java province reveals that the community <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> are carefully structured according to numerous administrative procedures and estab- lish a mode of control through a bureaucratic design. [...] - In den letzten Jahren hat sich community forestry als Mittel zur Reform von Machtkonstellationen in Bezug auf die Verwaltung von Wäldern herausgebildet. Der Zentralstaat versprach durch community forestry bestimmte Waldrechte an lokale Communities abzugeben und ermutigte sie, sich an Entscheidungsprozessen und der Implementierung von Forstaktivitäten zu beteiligen. Erfahrungen in einigen Ländern zeigen jedoch, dass die Implementierung von community forestry-Programmen selten mit einem tatsächlichen Machttransfer an lokale ForstnutzerInnen einhergeht, sondern diese Programme sogar als Mittel zur Rückgewinnung von zentralstaatlicher Kontrolle über Wälder dienen können. Anhand eines Fallbeispiels eines community forestry-Programms, das in Java, Indonesien, von einem staatlichen Forstunternehmen implementiert wird, argumentiere ich in diesem Artikel, dass die Implementierung von community forestry auch von den Interessen des Staates, Kontrolle über die Wälder zurückzugewinnen, vorangetrieben wird. Meine Forschung in acht Dörfern in der Provinz Zentral-Java zeigt, dass die community forestry-Programme sorgfältig nach zahlreichen administrativen Verfahren strukturiert sind und eine Art der Kontrolle durch bürokratisches Design etablieren...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:  It  is widely believed  that Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation  (PM&E)   can help {{community}} organisations  improve  their  internal  learning  and  governance. However,  {{the processes}} of programme monitoring and evaluation as practised by many organisations lack the elements of community participation and ownership and the appreciation of its contribution to community learning. Wider lessons on participatory development demonstrate that only locally‐ initiated and  community‐led monitoring  can  improve  communities ’  performance  and  change their institutional  practices. Drawing  on  the  recent  experience  of  Livelihoods  and  <b>Forestry</b> <b>Programme</b> (LFP),  this  paper  makes  the  case  for  community‐generated  planning,  self‐ monitoring and  evaluation  for  adaptive  learning  and  good  governance  in  Community  Forest User Groups (CFUGs)   in Nepal. These processes,  conceptualised as Adaptive Learning and Action (ALA),  have enabled CFUGs to identify their vision,  formulate activities to achieve the vision,  and regularly monitor the progress against the identified indicators.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the attitudes of}} local communities toward community <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> implemented by a project under the CF approach in Kosti area, based on a survey of 100 people living there. The household was the basic unit of data collection; ten villages were selected as study localities. Ten respondents from each village were randomly chosen for the interview. Frequency distribution results showed that almost all the respondents have a particularly favourable perception of the community <b>forestry</b> <b>programmes</b> implemented and they perceive the best type of management for running these forests {{which is to be}} owned and managed by them.

Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed a statistical significant relation between some selected variables (Respondents age, educational level, main occupation, respondents indigenous knowledge, family uses of different forestry products, awareness of causes of forest destruction and finally respondents awareness of environmental problems) exerted important influences on the attitudes and participation of respondents. This study suggests that the project and the forest services should continue addressing local development needs, encourage women's participation in community forestry, and work toward dispute settlement of community forest-user groups, if it wants to win the support of local communities for long-term environmental conservation goals...|$|R
