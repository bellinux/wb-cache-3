40|$|Unraveling {{structural}} features {{related to}} different <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycles</b> is fundamental {{for a better}} understanding of collisional orogens, particularly concerning the role of structural inheritance and extent of crustal reworking. In the Internal Domains of the Betic Cordillera, the geometry and kinematics of pre-Alpine contractional deformation in the Paleozoic basements are rather poorly known. At Ardales, a strongly deformed area corresponding to part of the Alpine suture zone of the Betic Cordillera, the Malaguide Complex consists of two distinct, superposed Alpine tectonic units, including both Paleozoic basement and Mesozoic-Tertiary cover rocks. Within the Alpine footwall unit, stratigraphic data document a tectonic superposition of two subunits made of different Paleozoic successions, which was later fossilized by Triassic redbeds. Structural analysis indicates that the contact between these subunits is an east-directed overthrust and that the internal structure of the lower subunit is consistent with bulk noncoaxial strain dominated by top-to-the-E shearing. These features show a marked contrast with the well-known Alpine nappe transport direction to the N-NW, with tectonic features developed along the Internal-External Domain boundary and with the structural trends obtained from the analysis of Mesozoic-Tertiary Malaguide rocks of the area. This study demonstrates that east-directed thrusting and shearing within Paleozoic Malaguide rocks resulted from Variscan tectonics and that careful, detailed, and integrated stratigraphic and structural analysis is necessary to avoid confusion between older and newer <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycles</b> in the Internal Domain Units of the Betic Cordillera...|$|R

The tungsten occurrences of Proterozoic age contain “mature” crustal lead, reflecting their association with crustal reworking through metamorphism and magmatism in the Proterozoic mobile belts.

The double switch in tectonic regime that led to the development of the Lucanian Apennines in southern Italy, from pre-orogenic drifting through synorogenic thrusting to post-orogenic extension, is preserved in a superb metre-scale outcrop at Serra Manarella, in the vicinity of San Fele. A Late Jurassic, synsedimentary normal fault is sealed by strata affected by a Mid-Pliocene thrust-related fold. This composite structure, in turn, is truncated by a Mid-Pleistocene normal fault.

The Chilean and Argentinian Frontal Andes batholiths, together with the Coastal Batholith, represent most of the pre Andean <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> plutonism. However, how late Paleozoic-Triassic magmatism occurred along this margin and its transition to the Andean <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> still remains unclear. Here we present a geodynamic model using all the available published Lu-Hf and oxygen isotopic data ranging from latitudes 28 degrees to 40 degrees S, together with 5 new Hf-O data and U-Pb zircon ages from the Chilean Frontal Andes. Data indicate that subduction began {{at least in the}} latest early Carboniferous and was continuous throughout the late Paleozoic-Triassic period. Isotopic and geochronological results show a continuous magmatic trend, from high delta O- 18 values (continental) to mantle like signatures, as the rocks get younger. Between latest early Carboniferous and earliest middle Permian, magmas formed in a subduction-related arc during the Gondwanide Orogeny. Later, throughout middle Permian to Triassic, magmatism occurred in a slab rollback extensional setting, triggered by low subducting plate velocities while Pangea was essentially in a static reference mode. There is no evidence for cessation of subduction during the Triassic and its renovation in the early Jurassic as previous work suggested. Therefore, we propose that Andean subduction has been a continuous tectonic process since Paleozoic times, whose initial. geodynamic evolution was directly related to the Gondwanide Orogeny as part of the Pangea Assembly. Slab rollback, as well as shallowing and steepening of the subduction angle were among the triggers for the change in the type of magmatism observed among these rocks...|$|E

40|$|The European Variscan and Alpine {{mountain}} {{chains are}} collisional orogens, and are built up of pre-Variscan "building blocks" which, in most cases, originated at the Gondwana margin.

The well-known nomenclatures applied to these mountain chains are the mirror of Variscan resp. Alpine organization. It is the aim of this paper to present a terminology taking into account their pre-Variscan evolution at the Gondwana margin. They may contain relics of volcanic islands with pieces of Cadomian crust, relics of volcanic arc settings, and accretionary wedges, which were separated from Gondwana by initial stages of Rheic ocean opening. After a short-lived Ordovician orogenic event and amalgamation of these elements at the Gondwanan margin, the still continuing Gondwana-directed subduction triggered the formation of Ordovician Al-rich granitoids and the latest Ordovician opening of Palaeo-Tethys.

40|$|A basic {{background}} is presented for {{the discussion of}} the Early Palaeozoic geology of western Argentina covered by this book. This includes the definition and terminology of <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycles</b> on this part of the Gondwana margin, represented by the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas. The Pampean orogeny (Early Cambrian) relates to an intense but short-lived period of terrane collision predating the rifting of the Precordillera terrane from Laurentia. The Famatinian cycle is predominantly represented by intense subductionrelated magmatism of Early-Middle Ordovician age, developed on the continental margin of Gondwana during the rifting and drifting of the Precordillera terrane. The Grenvillian basement of the latter is further exemplified by a new Rb-Sr whole-rock isochron age of 1021 ± 12 Ma for orthogneisses from the Western Sierras Pampeanas. A mid-Ordovician granite in this area (dated at 481 ± 6 Ma by U-Pb ion microprobe data) may be related to rifting while the Precordillera terrane was still attached to Laurentia. A divergence of opinion is pointed out between some authors in this book who favour mid-Ordovician collision of the Precordillera with Gondwana, and others who place it much latter, in Silurian or Devonian times...|$|R

The absolute age of the ultramafic intrusion that hosts the Limoeiro deposit is not yet known, but regional geologic constraints suggest that both intrusion and host rocks belong to a terrane older than the <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Peak metamorphic parageneses of the ultramafic intrusion and country rocks indicate granulite facies of metamorphism, interpreted {{as the result of the}} Neoproterozoic Brasiliano oro-genic cycle.

This intrusion forms a tube-like conduit (chonolith) with cross sections a few hundreds of meters in diameter and with a considerable length of more than 4 km.

40|$|Rocks {{associated}} with an orogenic gold system in the Paleoproterozoic Granites/Tanami Inlier of northern Australia exhibit strong natural remanent magnetism, identifiable in regional aeromagnetic data. Petrographical analysis indicates the two dominant magnetic minerals in the rocks of this region are multidomain magnetite and monoclinic pyrrhotite. Chemical analysis using an electron microprobe has determined that the magnetite and pyrrhotite are stoichiometrically pure, without significant elemental substitution. Alternating field demagnetization, Curie Temperature, and hysteresis analysis indicates that the remanently magnetized phase is monoclinic pyrrhotite with low magnetic susceptibility. In contrast, multidomain magnetites lack remanence and have high magnetic susceptibilities. Pyrrhotite is preserved in the rock mass along with other sulfide minerals as millimeter-scale veins parallel to regionally developed, penetrative mylonitic shear bands (c-planes) formed during sulfide remobilization in the waning, cooling stages of hydrothermal Au deposition. In contrast, magnetite grains exhibit porphyroblastic textures, consistent with formation during prograde to peak metamorphism, indicating formation prior to pyrrhotite, earlier in the <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Because of the low Curie Temperature (ca. 325 °C) of pyrrhotite, it is therefore likely that remanent magnetization effects observed in aeromagnetic images of the Tanami Inlier, are {{associated with}} structures intimately related to the late stages of Au mineralization during retrograde greenschist metamorphism after the peak thermal point of the <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Nicholas G.

Seismic probing of {{the upper}} crust in a catazonal massif in Tras 0 s Montes, Hercynian Iberia, {{demonstrates}} {{the absence of a}} root towards- the lower crust and favours a mechanism of thrust and nappe emplacement.

40|$|International audienceThe Dent Blanche Tectonic System (DBTS) is a {{composite}} thrust sheet derived from the previously thinned passive Adriatic continental margin. A kilometric high-strain zone, the Roisan-Cignana Shear Zone (RCSZ) defines the major tectonic boundary within the DBTS and separates it into two subunits, the Dent Blanche s. s. nappe to the northwest and the Mont Mary nappe to the southeast. Within this shear zone, tectonic slices of Mesozoic and pre-Alpine meta-sediments became amalgamated with continental basement rocks of the Adriatic margin. The occurrence of high pressure assemblages along the contact between these tectonic slices indicates that the amalgamation occurred prior to or during the subduction process, {{at an early stage}} of the Alpine <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Detailed mapping, petrographic and structural analysis show that the Roisan-Cignana Shear Zone results from several superimposed Alpine structural and metamorphic stages. Subduction of the continental fragments is recorded by blueschist-facies deformation, whereas the Alpine collision is reflected by a greenschist facies overprint associated with the development of large-scale open folds. The post-nappe evolution comprises the development of low-angle brittle faults, followed by large-scale folding (Vanzone phase) and finally brittle extensional faults. The RCSZ shows that fragments of continental crust had been torn off the passive continental margin prior to continental collision, thus recording the entire history of the <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> The role of preceding Permo-Triassic lithospheric thinning, Jurassic rifting, and ablative subduction processes in controlling the removal of crustal fragments from the reactivated passive continental margin is discussed. Results of this study constrain the temporal sequence of the tectono-metamorphic processes involved in the assembly of the DBTS, but they also show limits on the interpretation.

The divisions of the basement, the Southern and Northern Gneiss Units, are composed of acid gneisses, paragneisses, migmatites, orthoamphibolites and granites. Three sedimentary complexes are identified, the first (circa 1500 Ma.) resembles the Fjordane complex. The second is correlated with sediments in the Bergsdalen Nappes (older than 1000 Ma.), and with the Samnanger complex in the Bergen Arcs. The third sedimentary sequence is the Ashgillian, Holdhus sequence of the Bergen Arcs. The rocks of the Southern Gneiss Unit are derived from, and emplaced over, the Northern Gneisses during four deformations, {{each of which is}} separated by a sedimentary interval. The deformation involves 'mylonitic' processes acting at high temperatures and high strain rates.

Unresolved questions of the Pyrenean geology, as well as the understanding of the formation of hyper-extended passive margins, are how the crust was thinned, and when, where and how the crustal breakoff occurred. The study of the Variscan and pre-Variscan Pyrenean basement is thus critical to document and understand this Cretaceous crustal thinning. In order to specify the timing of Mesozoic metasomatism and the associated deformation in the pre-Mesozoic basement of the Pyrenees, we carried out a U–Th–Pb laser ablation ICP–MS study on a large panel of REE and titanium-rich minerals (titanite and rutile) from talc–chlorite ores from the eastern Pyrenees, with a special emphasis on the Trimouns deposit, the world’s largest talc quarry. Our results suggest that the Trimouns talc formation was restricted to the upper Aptian–Cenomanian time, while the talc and chlorite formation in the eastern Pyrenees occurred during several distinct Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous episodes.

40|$|AbstractLarge charnockite massifs {{occur in}} the {{high-grade}} Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT) and Eastern Ghats Belt (EGB) crustal provinces of Peninsular India. Available geochronological data indicate that the magmatism is episodic, associated with distinct <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycles</b> in the different crustal domains. The geochemical data also indicate a change in composition from trondhjemitic at ∼ 3. 0 – 2. 9  Ga to dominantly tonalitic at ∼ 2. 6 – 2. 5  Ga to tonalitic-granodiorite-granitic at ∼ 2. 0 – 1. 9  Ga to dominantly tonalitic at 1. 7 – 1. 6  Ga to quartz monzonitic or tonalitic at ∼ 1. 0 – 0. 9  Ga to granodiorite-granitic at ∼ 0. 8 – 0. 7  Ga. The trondhjemitic and tonalitic end members are metaluminous, magnesian and calcic to calc-alkalic, characteristic of magnesian group charnockites. The granodioritic to granitic end members are metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, ferroan and calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic, characteristic of ferroan group charnockites. The quartz monzonitic end members are metaluminous to peraluminous, magnesian to ferroan and calcic to calc-alkalic, neither characteristic of the magnesian group nor of the ferroan group of charnockites. Based on the occurrence and difference in composition of the charnockite massifs, {{it is suggested that}} the charnockite magmatism registers the crustal growth of the Indian plate on its southern (SGT) and eastern (EGB) sides, along active continental margins by accretion of arcs...|$|R
40|$|The western Mediterranean is {{the younger}} {{part of the}} Mediterranean, being a basin formed {{during the period from}} late Oligocene to the present. The western Mediterranean {{consists}} of a series of sub-basins, such as the Alboran, Valencia, Provenc ̧al, Algerian and Tyrrhenian Seas (Figs. 12. 1 and 12. 2). These basins have mainly a triangular shape and they generally young from west to east. They are partly floored by oceanic crust (Provenc ̧al and Algerian basins, and two smaller areas in the Tyrrhenian Sea). The remaining submarine part of the western Mediterranean basin is made of extensional and transtensional passive continental margins. The continental crust is composed of Paleozoic and pre-Paleozoic rocks deformed by the Caledo- nian and Variscan <b>orogenic</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the following, the gross structure of the Mediterranean structure and geody- namics is reviewed. In particular, the present day lithosphere-asthenosphere system is analyzed using two S-wave velocity cross-sections and the litho- spheric structure of the area is shown by lithospheric scale cross-sections along two regional-scale geotraverses. The lithospheric geological cross-sections are based on the result of the TRANSMED project (Cavazza et al., 2004), and the cross-sections discussed in this work are a simplification of the TRANSMED II (Roca et al., 2004) and TRANSMED III (Carminati et al., 2004) sections. The S-wave velocity cross-sections run parallel to the TRANSMED II and TRANSMED III geotraverses...|$|R
