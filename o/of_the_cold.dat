5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War {{is not always}} easily erased, {{as many of the}} economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|After the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia and the Central Asian republics were {{weakened}} {{economically and}} faced declines in GDP. Post-Soviet states underwent economic reforms and privatisation.

Elements of the suite's score have been used in several later films, and in two popular songs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War era.|$|E
5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, {{is the idea of}} atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|E

5|$|For most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the AFL {{saw little}} action, {{apart from a}} {{reinforced}} company group which was sent to ONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1960s.

The AFL became entangled in the conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 1996–97, and then the Second Liberian Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003.|$|E
