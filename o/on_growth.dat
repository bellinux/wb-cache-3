40|$|Fiscal {{policy has}} much {{controversial}} debate regarding its effectiveness <b>on</b> economic <b>growth.</b> Taxation and government expenditure {{are two main}} instruments of fiscal policy. This paper is aimed to analyze the effect of different categories of government expenditure <b>on</b> economic <b>growth</b> of Pakistan. Based on impact <b>on</b> economic <b>growth,</b> government expenditures are classified into productive (having positive or neutral effect <b>on</b> economic <b>growth)</b> and unproductive expenditures (having negative or insignificant impact <b>on</b> economic <b>growth).</b> The data time span for this study is 1979 - 2012. After classification of expenditures, the impact of fiscal instruments is analyzed by utilizing the ARDL approach of Co integration which is a better estimation technique for small sample size. The results reveal that unproductive government expenditure have negative impact while productive government expenditure has insignificant impact <b>on</b> the economic <b>growth.</b> It is found that private investment positively and significantly affect the economic <b>growth.</b> <b>On</b> the other side, direct and indirect taxes have also insignificant impact <b>on</b> economic <b>growth</b> of Pakista...|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based <b>on</b> <b>growth</b> conditions. In most actively growing adherent cells, NEDD9 migrates as a doublet of 115 and 105 kDa. Serine/threonine hyper-phosphorylated p115 NEDD9 {{is more common in}} G2/M phase cells, suggesting these modifications are associated with increased localization to centrosome and mitotic spindle. One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 is activated by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aemula resprouts from a {{lignotuber}} or shoots from epicormic buds after fire. Fire {{management of}} Banksia aemula heath in Southeast Queensland recommends 7- to 20-year fire intervals. Intervals of 10–15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by Leptospermum laevigatum. Experimenting with seed germination and early growth of B.aemula showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, inhibiting growth at double normal soil concentrations and causing seedling death at quadruple normal soil concentrations. The addition of potassium or magnesium ameliorated these effects a little although potassium in high concentrations impacted <b>on</b> <b>growth</b> as well. Overall, seedlings grow slowly {{over the first}} 21 weeks of life compared with other plant species, the reasons for which are unclear, {{although it may be}} that it offers an increased chance of survival in a nutrient- or water-poor environment.

5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, <b>On</b> <b>Growth</b> and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects <b>on</b> <b>growth</b> rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E
