5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> the patient's level of activity and arousal, and <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

40|$|Mirror neurons are a {{distinct}} class of neurons that discharge both during {{the execution of}} a motor act and during <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> the same or similar motor act performed by another individual. However, {{the extent to which}} mirror neurons coding a motor act with a specific goal (e. g., grasping) might also respond to the <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> a motor act having the same goal, but achieved with artificial effectors, is not yet established. In the present study, we addressed this issue by recording mirror neurons from the ventral premotor cortex (area F 5) of two monkeys trained to grasp objects with pliers. Neuron activity was recorded during the <b>observation</b> and execution <b>of</b> grasping performed with the hand, with pliers and during <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> an experimenter spearing food with a stick. The results showed that virtually all neurons responding to the <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> hand grasping also responded to the <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> grasping with pliers and, many of them to the <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> spearing with a stick.
