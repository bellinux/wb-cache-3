5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided.

The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III).

In the end, few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> would yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E
