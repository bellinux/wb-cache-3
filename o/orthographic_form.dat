40|$|Recently {{researchers}} {{have become increasingly}} interested in the influence of <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> on second language (L 2) phonology. <b>Orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> (or spellings) represent the sounds and words of a language in writing. L 2 learners, in particular those in instructed settings, are simultaneously exposed to the <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> and the phonological forms of the target language. Recent investigations have indicated that orthographic input can affect learners’ phonological development and word learning in their second language in various ways. The availability of L 2 <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> in the input to L 2 learners can facilitate speech production, perception, and/or word form learning (Escudero, Hayes-Harb, & Mitterer, 2008; Showalter & Hayes-Harb, 2013). It can hinder targetlike acquisition (Bassetti, 2007; Hayes-Harb, Nicol, & Barker, 2010), or it can have mixed effects or no effect at all (Escudero & Wanrooij, 2010; Simon, Chamblessb, & Alvesc, 2010). ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} which Selmi proposed is that Dante Alighieri {{had known}} {{and read the}} work of the Grossetan writer and that he had been inspired by him for the drafting of his own work in the national dialect, understandable to all the inhabitants of the entire peninsula. The hypothesis is justified by the fact that, in all the ancient codes of Dante's Comedy that are known, there is a change of the letter n for the letter r within the verbs (for example, possoro instead of possono, correct Italian word for they can), an <b>orthographic</b> <b>form</b> which had never been seen before in codes dating previously to Dante's time, except that one the works of Andrea da Grosseto. And so there is the possibility that the Grossetan author, following a desinence of his own dialect, introduced this <b>orthographic</b> <b>form</b> in the written work and that Dante had made use of this form. But although some scholars are in agreement with this hypothesis, the matter has not been addressed since and still remains to be cleared with certainty.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that orthography is {{activated}} during speech processing and that it may have positive and negative effects for non-native listeners. The present study examines whether the effect of orthography on non-native word learning depends on the relationship between the grapheme-phoneme correspondences across the native and non-native orthographic systems. Specifically, congruence between grapheme-phoneme correspondences across the listeners’ languages is predicted to aid word recognition, while incongruence is predicted to hinder it. Native Spanish listeners who were Dutch learners or naïve listeners (with no exposure to Dutch) were taught Dutch pseudowords and their visual referents. They were trained with only auditory forms or with auditory and <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms.</b> During testing, non-native listeners were less accurate when the target and distractor pseudowords formed a minimal pair (differing in only one vowel) than when they formed a non-minimal pair, and performed better on perceptually easy than on perceptually difficult minimal pairs. For perceptually difficult minimal pairs, Dutch learners performed better than naïve listeners and Dutch proficiency predicted learners’ word recognition accuracy. Most importantly and as predicted, exposure to <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> during training aided performance on minimal pairs with congruent orthography, while it hindered performance on minimal pairs with incongruent orthography...|$|R

Participants were native users of the phonologically transparent Italian writing system. Study 1 investigated the pronunciation of “silent letters,” using a word-reading task and a word-repetition task. Study 2 examined the effects of vowel spelling on vowel duration, namely, whether L 2 speakers produce the same target vowel as longer when it is spelled with a vowel digraph than with a singleton letter. Study 3 explored the effects of the morphemic spelling of the past tense marker using a verb paradigm-production task. Study 4 tested whether L 2 speakers produce homophonic words differently when they are spelled differently.

After getting an approval for his scheme from the Madras Provinces Education Department, Mögling published this entire book in his devised orthography.

50|$|The {{period of}} Classical Malay started when Islam gained its {{foothold}} {{in the region and}} the elevation of its status to a state religion.

Pre-Classical Malay took on a more radical form as attested in the 1303 CE Terengganu Inscription Stone and the 1468 CE Pengkalan Kempas Inscription from Malay peninsula.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to understand better how morphemic units are encoded and auto-organised in memory and how they are accessed during writing. We hypothesised that the activation of morphemic units would not depend on rule-based learning during primary school but would be determined by frequency-based learning, which is a process that automatically encodes whole <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> encountered during reading. To evaluate gradual changes in the impacts of each process, the ability to inflect a verb was investigated in a spelling-to-dictation task utilising simple sentences that included past participle inflections in three participant populations: 2 nd to 5 th primary-school graders, 6 th and 8 th secondary-school students with varying print linguistic abilities and young adults. Two frequency indicators were manipulated: past participle inflection frequency (the frequency of a particular suffix irrespective of the word root) was used to index the use of a rule-based procedure, and orthographic-form frequency was used to index the use of a frequency-based procedure. The results revealed the following: (a) the younger spellers mainly used a frequency-based procedure that produced many spelling errors that were mostly due to the selection of the most frequent <b>orthographic</b> <b>forms</b> in their <b>orthographic</b> lexicon; (b) the rule-based procedure is notably late and led to fewer errors only at the 5 th grade in primary school; and (c) the frequency-based procedure is still operating in the less skilled spellers of grades six and eight. The results are discussed in light of statistical learning, which seems to jeopardise the use of an efficient grammatical processing by younger children and less skilled spellers...|$|R
5000|$|Some Greek {{words were}} {{borrowed}} into Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages. English often received these words from French. Their phonetic and <b>orthographic</b> <b>form</b> has sometimes changed considerably. For instance, place was borrowed both by Old English and by French from Latin platea, itself borrowed from Greek πλατεία (ὁδός) 'broad (street)'; the Italian piazza and Spanish plaza {{have the same}} origin, and have been borrowed into English in parallel. The word olive comes through the Romance from the Latin word olīva, which in turn comes from the Greek [...] (elaíwā). [...] A later Greek word, [...] (boútȳron) becomes Latin butyrum and eventually English 'butter'. A large group of early borrowings, again transmitted first through Latin, then through various vernaculars, comes from Christian vocabulary: chair << καθέδρα (cf. 'cathedra'), bishop << ἐπίσκοπος (epískopos 'overseer'), priest << πρεσβύτερος (presbýteros 'elder'), and church < Old English cirice, circe < probably κυριακή οἰκία (kȳriakḗ oikía 'lord's house'). In some cases, the orthography of these words was later changed to reflect the Greek - and Latin - spelling: e.g., quire was respelled as choir in the 17th century.|$|E

Historically, many peoples who had interactions with the ancestors of the Ainu called them and their islands Kuyi, Kuye, Qoy, or some similar name, which may have some connection to the early modern form Kai. The Kai element also strongly resembles the Sino-Japanese reading of the characters [...] (Sino-Japanese , Japanese kun'yomi [...] ), which have been used for over a thousand years in China and Japan as the standard <b>orthographic</b> <b>form</b> to be used when referring to Ainu and related peoples; it is possible that Matsuura's Kai was actually an alteration, influenced by the Sino-Japanese reading of [...] Ka-i, of the Nivkh exonym for the Ainu, namely Qoy or [...]|$|E
5000|$|As {{pointed out}} above, the {{convergence}} {{in form of}} many of the characters of Book Pahlavi causes a high degree of ambiguity in most Pahlavi writing {{and it needs to be}} resolved by the context. Some mergers are restricted to particular groups of words or individual spellings. Further ambiguity is added by the fact that even outside of ligatures, the boundaries between letters are not clear, and many letters look identical to combinations of other letters. As an example, one may take the fact that the name of God, Ohrmazd, could equally be read (and, by Parsis, often was read) Anhoma. Historically speaking, it was spelt , a fairly straightforward spelling for an abjad. However, [...] had coalesced with [...] had coalesced, in the spelling of certain words, with both [...] and and [...] had been reduced, in the spelling of certain words, to a form whose combination with [...] was indistinguishable from a , which in turn had coalesced with [...] This meant that the same <b>orthographic</b> <b>form</b> that stood for [...] could also be interpreted as [...] (among many other possible readings). The logograms could also pose problems. For this reason, important religious texts were sometimes transcribed into the phonetically unambiguous Avestan alphabet.
