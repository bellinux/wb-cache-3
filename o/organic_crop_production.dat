Especially perennial weed {{species such as}} Elytrigia repens, Cirsium arvense and Tussilago farfara are posing problems as arable cropping systems do not hamper their vegetative proliferation sufficiently.

40|$|We {{can obtain}} {{important}} results from short-term field studies, but they don’t always capture year-to year variability. Long-term research often provides more reliable results that farmers need,” says Agricultural Research Service horticulturist Eric Brennan. Brennan speaks from personal experience. In 2003, {{he and a}} team of University of California-Davis collaborators began a 2 -year field study that evolved into a unique long-term investigation of high value <b>organic</b> <b>cropping.</b> The project, the Salinas <b>Organic</b> <b>Cropping</b> Systems trial, is being conducted on an ARS research farm and is now in its 10 th year of certified organic production. Brennan, who works in the ARS Crop Improvement and Protection Research Unit in Salinas, California, is analyzing a huge collection of data to pinpoint findings that can benefit commercial producers of <b>organic</b> <b>crops.</b> <b>Production</b> expenses for high-value <b>organic</b> <b>crops</b> like lettuce and broccoli can exceed $ 7, 000 per acre. Producers who pay high land rent need to maximize profits with an annual two- to three-crop rotation that also includes either keeping fields fallow in the winter or planting winter cover crops. Many farmers keep winter fields bare because of the extra work and expense of tilling cover crop residues into the soil. Planting a cover crop also requires allowing enough time for its residue to decompose before planting cash crops—and production schedules can become very tight if prolonged spring rains keep farmers from plowing under the winter cover crops. Brennan designed a long-term investigation of several different cover cropping strategies for an annual lettuce-broccoli production system. Six of the strategies involved cover cropping every winter, and the other two involved cover cropping every fourth winter. Brennan selected three winter cover crops often grown in the area—rye, mustard, and a legume-rye mix—and planted each at either a typical seeding rate or a rate three times higher. Seeding rates can affect a cover crop’s ability to smother weeds. All systems received the same fertilizer and irrigation inputs and pest management. Harvest and sale of the lettuce and broccoli crops—which met all U. S. Department of Agriculture organic standards—were conducted by a commercial harvester...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{parameters}} of a Swedish long-term field experiment comparing organic and conventional agricultural systems were evaluated. There is {{great potential for}} misinterpretation of system comparisons {{as a result of}} choice of data and how energy data are expressed. For example, reported yields based on single crops and not the whole rotation can result in significantly different interpretations. Energy use per unit yield was lower in <b>organic</b> <b>crop</b> and animal <b>production</b> than in the corresponding conventional system, as previously found in other studies. This is due to the exclusion of N fertiliser, the largest energy input in conventional cropping systems. Energy use per unit yield expresses system efficiency, but the term is insufficient to evaluate the energy characteristics of agricultural systems. Calculation of the most important energy component, net energy production per unit area, showed that conventional systems produced far more energy per hectare than organic systems. The energy productivity (output/input ratio), i. e. the energy return on inputs, was at least six in both types of agriculture, revealing the highly positive energy balance of <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> in general. Lower yields in the organic systems, and consequently lower energy production per unit area, mean that more land is required to produce the same amount of energy. This greater land requirement in organic production must be considered in energy balances. When the same area of land is available for <b>organic</b> and conventional <b>crop</b> <b>production,</b> the latter allows for complementary bio-energy production and can produce all the energy required for farming, such as fuels, N fertilisers, etc., in the form of ethanol. In a complete energy balance, options such as combustion, gasification or use as fodder of protein residues from ethanol production must also be taken into account. There is a common belief that the high fossil fuel requirement in N fertiliser production is non-sustainable. This is a misconception, since the use of N fertilisers provides a net energy gain. If N fertilisers were to be completely replaced by biological N₂ fixation, net energy production would be significantly lower. In addition, N fertiliser production can be based on renewable energy sources such as bio-fuels produced by gasification. Conventional <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> is thus energetically fully sustainable. Energy analyses of agricultural systems presented in this chapter illustrate that published data may require recalculation in relation to the background, prevailing trends and boundary conditions, and subsequent re-interpretation. New perspectives on energy use must also be considered...|$|R

While extensive crop production is adopted by about 60 per cent of all eligible farms, {{the adoption}} of <b>organic</b> <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> is very limited. Using logistic regressions we find that farms located in adverse production conditions (e. g. at higher altitudes) {{are more likely to}} be adopters of extensive crop production.

We find that organic producers tend to be slightly younger and better educated than other farmers. However, no differences in farmers’ age and education are found between non-adopters and extensive crop producers. This shows that, in general, the non-adoption of agri-environmental programmes in Switzerland is not primarily an educational problem.
