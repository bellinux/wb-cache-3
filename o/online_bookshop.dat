The research finds that while the convenience of <b>online</b> <b>bookshops</b> is important, the key factors enticing consumers online are a combination of breadth of range, ease of access to obscure titles, as well as ‘personalised’ recommendations and customer reviews. The research is of value to the book trade, highlighting consumer responses to widely adopted online marketing approaches. The research also contributes to scholarly knowledge {{in the fields of}} consumer behaviour, e-marketing and e-commerce in online bookselling, as well as providing findings which can be tested in other online settings, informing future theoretical research...|$|R

Interdisciplinary topics, like LIS and sociology of literature may have similar points of contact, which we want to highlight with this thesis. It is also possible to extract understanding of their own research topic by taking advantage of each other's knowledge. This is done in our paper by using Lars Furuland´s model, den litterära processen, as a starting point. The interlocking of posts on bookblogs, reader response and Online book shops, we believe demonstrates that bookblogs have a place in the Swedish literary society...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Online {{trust is}} one of the key {{obstacles}} to vendors succeeding on the internet medium; a lack of trust is likely to discourage online consumers from participating in e-commerce. This research aims to investigate how online consumers develop their initial trust and purchase intentions. The research in conducted in the context of Taiwanese online bookstores. Design/methodology/ approach - The research examines consumers' online initial trust by using four major categories of determinants: perceived technology, perceived risk, company competency, and trust propensity. It also investigates the impacts of both online initial trust and familiarity with online purchasing on purchase intention. The research model is statistically tested using the web sites of four online bookstores in Taiwan. The web site selected by each respondent is unfamiliar. Findings - It is found that perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise are the important antecedents to online initial trust. It is also discovered that different levels of trust propensity moderate perceptions toward the web site and online with respect to online initial trust, including perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise. Both online initial trust and familiarity with online purchasing have a positive impact on purchase intention. Originality/value - The research provides insight into the development of online initial trust by consumers, and the relationships between online initial trust and purchase intention. The research model was created and then tested in the context of <b>online</b> <b>bookshops</b> in Taiwan...|$|R

50|$|Britain Yearly Meeting's current book of {{discipline}} is called Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian {{discipline of the}} Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain. The text of the first edition was originally approved by the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain in 1994, and it has had four revisions since then, mainly because {{of changes in the}} structure of the Yearly Meeting. The fourth revision (giving rise to the 5th Edition, dated 2013) was in connection with the Quaker approval of same-sex marriage in the UK. It is often known simply as Quaker Faith and Practice, or sometimes the (Christian) 'Book of Discipline' but this has become less common. The current version, therefore, (in June 2014) is the fifth edition. It is available in paperback, hardback and large print, and is also free to view online.

5000|$|Banker has {{published}} in several genres, ranging from contemporary fiction about urban life in India to multi-volume mythological epics, {{as well as}} cross-genre works. Three of his early novels to be published were crime thrillers, {{claimed to be the}} first written by an Indian novelist in English. They gained him widespread attention and still continue to be regarded with critical approval. Most recently, literary critic Zac O'Yeah wrote: [...] "Slimmer and much more hard-boiled are three striking crime novels written by Ashok Banker many years ago. I still remember reading The Iron Bra, a blood-soaked story of a female investigator, Sheila Ray, whose finger rests lightly on the trigger as she defends her family’s reputation and takes on gangsters in a particularly unforgettable shootout. The growing city’s construction sites were a crucial component in the tight plot. Tragically, my own copy is long lost and second-hand copies cost $129 (approx. Rs6,000) plus shipping on an <b>online</b> <b>bookshop,</b> so it looks like it’s high time to have this gem of a crime novel reissued in an omnibus edition along with Banker’s Ten Dead Admen and Murder & Champagne (all three originally published in 1993)." [...] His Kali Rising is a contemporary radical feminist thriller series featuring only women protagonists. The first book, Blood Red Sari, was launched at the Tata Literature Live! literary festival in Mumbai in November 2012.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper will}} focus on a {{traditional}} interlibrary loan policy versus a set of alternative approaches. The result of applying the new methods has proved to provide the end user with the requested information more quickly - {{and in many cases}} also at a lower price. At CERN, the Interlibrary Loan Service more and more frequently purchases books via <b>online</b> <b>bookshops,</b> either as hard copies or as e-books, in place of borrowing these book from expensive document delivery services abroad. For articles it is even more evident that new approaches speed up the operation and cut costs. However, the providers selling articles on the net do not so far contribute to a cost reduction as they still seem to be relying on the justification of making a high profit delivering the information 'just in time'. In some branches of science, however, the situation is quite different as electronic preprints {{have been a part of}} the scientific culture for more than ten years. This trend is now spreading into many more fields and allows librarians today to give up ordering articles via the traditional channels, and instead instantaneously propose free preprints or self archived versions of the requested papers to their clients. Taking advantage of the free versions available on the net will not only reduce costs and save time for the end user, but it will also be an important signal to the scientific community that librarians are ready to support the migration from the present system of scientific publishing to a toll-free access to scientific information...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{set goals}} of {{improving}} book consumption in Slovenia the National Culture Program 2004 - 2007 also includes encouraging {{the development of}} network of bookshops and ‘quality’ bookshops, that will be evenly distributed across Slovenia. The program suggests them to be formed {{within the framework of}} already existing public cultural institutions. Book consumption in Slovenia has been characterised by poorly developed retail book market and well developed network of public libraries with a high number of book lendings that serves as a substitute for the paperback market as it is known in bigger language communities abroad. Along with surveying the possibilities of directing the libraries towards book marketing (as well), the paper also examines the historical development of commercial publishing companies / bookshops / libraries, existing in Europe in 18 th and 19 th century and in some places existing side by side with public libraries until the middle of 20 th century. The paper shows that the present ratio between bookshops and libraries on some big book markets is different than in Slovenia, as libraries are loosing patrons {{as a consequence of the}} growth of big bookshop chains. A characteristic feature of book consumption in Slovenia can be seen in the use of the internet in libraries as well as bookshops. The ‘merging’ of the marketing segment and book lending is to a smaller extent already under way abroad, where large <b>online</b> <b>bookshops</b> encourage libraries by means of provision to act as the mediator in the sale of books. In this way, a library can turn into a bookshop with the help of connections via ISBN numbers, without having to jeopardise their original mission...|$|R

The work of third sector organisations providing access and attempts by the visually impaired community itself to enhance access are described. Realities effecting support workers in universities who have to help visually impaired students investigated. Legal disputes relating to copyright and anti-discrimination law are discussed. Developments in the ebooks market are monitored with a particular reference to attempts to build accessibility into devices like the Kindle and Apple products. The research also looks at how best to secure access to <b>online</b> <b>bookshops,</b> web pages offering ebooks for download in public libraries and ebook libraries in academia. The current level of access being achieved in this area is assessed. Next ongoing attempts to improve access and differing views on the advisability of an approach based on enforcement of the Worldwide Web Consortium's accessibility guidelines or a more flexible approach emphasising user testing are discussed. Conclusions and recommendations: changes to copyright law and further development and clarification of anti-discrimination law as it applies to publishers are necessary. Libraries should adopt a more innovative approach and field some of the specialist provision currently undertaken by charitable organisations. Accessibility to relevant websites is probably best provided by a combination of ongoing relationship building and with web developers and a more flexible approach than rigid enforcement of accessibility guidelines.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} implementation of marketing both by chain and online booksellers, and consumer responses to this marketing and {{a reading of the}} current trade press revealed calls for research into consumer wants and needs (Watson, 2002; Holman, 2007; Horner, 2007 a). While BML (Book Marketing Limited) carries out a valuable range of research into publishing and bookselling on an ongoing basis, nevertheless, both are relatively new research areas, and bookselling is particularly underdeveloped. It would appear that research in the field of bookselling has yet to be examined in an academic context. With specific respect {{to the development of a}} comprehensive understanding of consumer responses to bookshop marketing, the research is original, timely and useful, and builds upon the foundations of existing research, as detailed above. The mixed-method approach adopted in this study enhanced the level of triangulation possible, with interviews, surveys and focus groups serving to consolidate and support sets of results. This empirical research has uncovered rich source material from consumers both online and offline, revealing complex responses to traditional and online bookselling environments. Key original findings include: the widespread perception of homogeneity across chain bookshops by consumers; the presence of a coffee shop can enhance the concept of the bookshop as a social space and that consumer behaviour online was found to tend towards linear, goal-oriented book buying, whereas traditional book shopping tends to be much more about browsing, and have a serendipitous quality to it. The research has developed a comprehensive understanding of the approaches to marketing taken by chain booksellers, but more especially, the range of consumer responses and behaviour in both traditional chain and <b>online</b> <b>bookshops.</b> It has built upon the existing scholarly material available in these fields, as well as extending and developing research in the new academic field of bookselling. There is considerable scope for further investigation in both traditional and online bookselling, as outlined in the Conclusions chapter, building on the findings emerging from this research...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of electronic commerce (in the following eCommerce) has increased significantly {{during the past}} decade. In this context this study analyses the antecedents and effects of customer satisfaction concerning german <b>online</b> <b>bookshop</b> trade. The study is based on data collected from 309 privat german customers. The data was collected through an online survey in spring of 2005. The data evaluation was realized with Amos.
