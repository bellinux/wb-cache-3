50|$|<b>Osteoplasty</b> is {{the branch}} of surgery {{concerned}} with bone repair or bone grafting. It is the surgical alteration or reshaping of bone. It {{may be used to}} relieve pain associated with metastatic bone disease. Percutaneous <b>osteoplasty</b> involves the use of bone cement to reduce pain and improve mobility. Resection <b>osteoplasty</b> is used in joint preserving surgery on the hip and thigh bones.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{treatments}} include bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, radiotherapy, and radionucleotides.Percutaneous <b>osteoplasty</b> {{involves the}} use of bone cement to reduce pain and improve mobility. [...] In palliative therapy, the main options are external radiation and radiopharmaceuticals. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has CE approval for palliative care for bone metastasis, though treatments are still in investigatory phases as more information is needed to study effectiveness in order to obtain full approval in countries such as the USA.|$|E
30|$|<b>Osteoplasty</b> {{has been}} {{discouraged}} in long bones. However, despite a substantial lack of pre-clinical biomechanical tests, multiple clinical studies have implemented {{a wide range}} of techniques to optimise long bone <b>osteoplasty.</b> The aim of the present study is to evaluate the biomechanical properties of <b>osteoplasty</b> alone and in combination with Kirschner wires (K-wires) in a cadaveric human diaphyseal model undergoing 3 -point bending stress.|$|E
40|$|It {{is easy to}} {{overlook}} osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the ankle in patients with chronic lower limb pain, such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO, Buerger’s disease). A 57 -year-old woman diagnosed with type 1 CRPS, and a 58 -year-old man, diagnosed with TAO, complained of tactile and cold allodynia in their lower legs. After neurolytic lumbar sympathethic ganglion block and titration of medications for neuropathic pain, each subject could walk {{without the aid of}} crutches. However, they both complained of constant pain on the left ankle during walking. Focal tenderness was noted; subsequent imaging studies revealed OCLs of her talus and his distal tibia, respectively. Immediately after percutaneous <b>osteoplasties,</b> the patients could walk without ankle pain. It is important to consider the presence of a hidden OCL in chronic pain patients that develop weight-bearing pain and complain of localized tenderness on the ankle. (Korea...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{objectives}} of surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement are {{to improve the}} symptoms and to prevent or slow the progression of osteoarthritis by improving joint clearance between the acetabular rim and the femoral neck. Arthroscopic correction of bone abnormalities and treatment of articular lesions {{requires the use of}} techniques that provide good access to the peripheral and central compartments of the hip joint. Various patient positions and portal placements have been suggested. The sequence used to access the two compartments may differ according to the option chosen. Entering the central compartment first is the most popular technique for arthroscopic hip joint access and requires joint distraction under fluoroscopic monitoring. Accessing the peripheral compartment first can be achieved without distraction and does not always require fluoroscopic guidance. Regardless of the sequence, capsulotomy greatly facilitates the therapeutic procedures that are common to all approaches. <b>Osteoplasties</b> are conducted after careful pre-operative planning based on various visual or fluoroscopic landmarks. Several options are available for treating articular cartilage and labral lesions...|$|R

30|$|Musculoskeletal: <b>osteoplasty,</b> kyphoplasty and {{placement}} of stabilisation materials, intervertebral disc treatment.|$|E
30|$|Percutaneous image-guided <b>osteoplasty</b> and osteosynthesis {{can be used}} to fix cancer-related bone fractures.|$|E
30|$|In several reports, <b>osteoplasty</b> {{has been}} {{combined}} with dedicated spindles, modified mandrins, and multiple micro-needle mesh to optimise biomechanical resistance of PMMA to multi-directional stresses (rebar concept) [10]. Studies in the proximal femur [9, 10, 12] and long bone diaphyses [10] have illustrated good analgesia and restoration of functional status, with either no secondary fractures [9, 10] or fewer than with <b>osteoplasty</b> alone [12], at 6 – 16 -month follow-up. Our {{study did not}} demonstrate any beneficial effect of <b>osteoplasty</b> augmented with K-wires, although this may reflect sample limitations, test protocol, or suboptimal composite material properties. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of biomechanical evidence and long-term follow-up to support these procedures.|$|E
30|$|<b>Osteoplasty</b> is {{discouraged}} {{for long}} bone tumours {{due to the}} risk of secondary fractures.|$|E
30|$|Thirty {{unpaired}} human cadaveric hemi-tibia specimens {{were randomly}} assigned to receive no consolidation (group 1, n[*]=[*] 10), <b>osteoplasty</b> alone (group 2, n[*]=[*] 10), or K-wires augmented <b>osteoplasty</b> (group 3, n[*]=[*] 10). Specimens were tested on a dedicated servo-hydraulic machine using a 3 -point bending test. Fracture load was calculated for each specimen; two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess differences between groups.|$|E
30|$|<b>Osteoplasty</b> with {{or without}} Kirschner wires {{augmentation}} did not improve the biomechanical properties of long bones.|$|E
40|$|There is {{emerging}} evidence that even mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis leads to early articular damage. Therefore, {{we have begun}} treating patients with mild slips and signs of impingement with in situ pinning and immediate arthroscopic <b>osteoplasty.</b> DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUES: Surgery was performed using the fracture table. After in situ pinning and diagnostic arthroscopy, peripheral compartment access was obtained and head-neck <b>osteoplasty</b> was completed...|$|E
30|$|The biomechanical {{properties}} of <b>osteoplasty</b> {{with or without}} Kirschner wires augmentation have been tested in long bones.|$|E
30|$|<b>Osteoplasty</b> with {{or without}} K-wires {{augmentation}} does not improve the resistance of diaphyseal bone to bending stresses.|$|E
30|$|Multiple {{clinical}} studies have implemented {{a wide range}} of techniques to optimise long bone <b>osteoplasty</b> without pre-clinical biomechanical assessment.|$|E
30|$|Painful lytic supra-acetabular BM {{represent}} a suitable indication for percutaneous <b>osteoplasty</b> {{in this area}} of high compressive stress [22]. Nevertheless, if the acetabular BM is complicated by a fracture, osteosynthesis should be considered [5, 13]. Osteosynthesis is also indicated in cases of minimally or non-displaced fractures of the iliac wing or the ilio/ischio-pubic ramus as well as the midline fractures of the sacrum [5, 13]. In the end, if sacral wings fractures are noted, <b>osteoplasty</b> is indicated [23].|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{confirms}} that <b>osteoplasty</b> {{alone or in}} combination with K-wires does not improve the resistance of diaphyseal bone subjected to bending stress. Therefore, at the moment, long bone <b>osteoplasty</b> and its variants should still {{be considered as a}} suboptimal choice for the consolidation of pathological/impending diaphyseal fractures; as a result, this technique should be avoided in good-prognosis cancer patients and proposed with caution in poor-prognosis, predominantly bed-ridden cancer patients presenting with painful lytic tumours.|$|E
30|$|Each tibia was {{measured}} in long axis and axially transected in the mid-diaphysis using an oscillating bone saw. A total of 40 experimental specimens (proximal/distal, right/left hemi-tibias) were obtained. Ten randomly selected specimens were utilised for initial feasibility assessment and excluded from the final study sample. Six {{were used to assess}} the technical feasibility of <b>osteoplasty</b> and K-wires augmented <b>osteoplasty</b> procedures and to optimise biomechanical loading protocols. Four specimens were used to assess the technical feasibility of <b>osteoplasty</b> with PMMA-filled catheter augmentation, a novel procedure in which PMMA-filled biliary catheters are used as intramedullary nails to optimise the consolidative properties of PMMA <b>osteoplasty</b> [11]. The technique utilises accessible and familiar equipment and may provide clinical benefits [11]. Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} replicate this construct in our cadaveric specimens. Despite numerous attempts to manually inject PMMA (using 3 -mL syringes at room temperature of 22 [*]°C) into 8 – 14 Fr biliary catheters positioned longitudinally within the bone specimens using a vertebroplasty trocar (n[*]=[*] 4) and extra-osseously (n[*]=[*] 1), it was not possible to obtain homogeneous intraluminal cement distribution without causing catheter fracture. This method was therefore not investigated.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} protocol for alveolar cleft reconstruction is repair during the mixed dentition stage (age, 9 to 11 years), before eruption of the canine teeth. Alveolar bone grafting {{should not be considered}} as an isolated therapy but always as an integrated part of comprehensive orthodontic treatment. METHODS: The authors evaluate the results of transitional secondary <b>osteoplasty,</b> comparing the use of autogenous cancellous bone versus heterogenetic implants, in patients with unilateral complete clefts who did or did not undergo orthodontic treatment. From 1990 to 1994, 48 patients aged between 9 and 11 years with unilateral alveolar cleft underwent alveolar grafting by transitional secondary <b>osteoplasty.</b> In 30 patients (group A), autogenous cancellous bone was used, and in 18 patients (group B), a heterogenetic implant consisting of demineralized bone powder containing bone morphogenetic protein and hydroxylapatite was used. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients in group A and 12 patients in group B underwent orthodontic treatment. After 10 to 12 years of follow-up, the clinical and radiographic examinations revealed that the best alveolar bone repair results were obtained using autologous bone graft in association with orthodontic treatment. Also, in the patients who underwent heterogenetic implantation, the orthodontic treatment clearly improved the quality of the <b>osteoplasty.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The essential conditions for a successful <b>osteoplasty</b> include meticulous operative technique and orthodontic treatment. The latter plays an essential role at several stages of development in children with clefts. The "functional stress" on the autologous or heterogenetic implant exerts a decisive influence on the quality and volume of the <b>osteoplasty,</b> preventing progressive resorption...|$|E
30|$|Whilst {{making a}} choice between the <b>osteoplasty</b> and osteosynthesis, the {{predominant}} biomechanics of the target bone {{as well as the}} type of fracture should be taken into account.|$|E
40|$|Amputation <b>osteoplasty</b> is a {{technique}} modification promoted by Ertl to enhance rehabilitation after transtibial amputation. Two different techniques for creating sealing of the medullary canal and a distal bone block have been described in the literature. One technique consists of a periosteal sleeve that is sutured over the cut end of the bone. The second technique consists of hinging a segment of fibula into a slot in the cut end of the tibia. The desired goal of amputation <b>osteoplasty</b> {{is to create an}} end-bearing limb to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to creation of a bone bridge, Ertl also recommends myoplasty, neuroplasty, individual vessel ligation, and a special skin closure. This report is a small case series of five patients successfully treated with lower extremity amputation <b>osteoplasty,</b> to illustrate the techniques and report initial good results. Two patients had each of the techniques and one patient had both of the techniques. All five patients had good wound healing, accelerated rehabilitation, and the ability to use end-bearing prostheses...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} the results of osteoplastic biomaterials application to reach the improvement of primary and long-term secondary stability of fixation. Materials and methods: 62 patients with bone defect of metaepiphy-sis of type 2 according to AORI have been included into the research. Total knee arthroplasty with <b>osteoplasty</b> of the defect {{has been carried out}} in all the patients. In the basic group (n= 32) combined <b>osteoplasty</b> has been used, and in comparison group (n= 30) cement <b>osteoplasty</b> has been applied. In cases with total arthroplasty in the basic group modifying standard resections, structural autograft of laminar form has been received simultaneously. After preparing the floor of the defect its plasty has been carried out: in the basic group the defect has been filled with osteoconductive biomaterial, and in the comparison group — with polymethylmethacrylate to restore the anatomical configuration of condyles. Besides, before cement fixation of the prosthesis in the basic group the received autograft has been put on the restored implant plateau. Results: Assessing the results during the period from 2 to 4 years objective criteria have included the data of X-ray imaging, biomechanical research and WOMAC test. In the postoperative period significant differences have not been revealed. In the follow-up period in the group with application of the combined <b>osteoplasty</b> joint remodulation of autograft and osteoplastic biomaterial with regenerative restoration of bone tissue of the implant plateau has been observed. Conclusion: The described technique may reduce the relative risk of revision arthroplasty...|$|E
30|$|Two interventional radiologists with 3 - and 5 -year {{experience}} in bone consolidation performed bone augmentation (groups 2 and 3). For group 2, <b>osteoplasty</b> was performed using a 10 -G vertebroplasty needle (Gangi Special Vertebroplasty Needle Set, Optimed, Ettlingen, Germany) advanced within the central long {{axis of the}} specimen via the transected surface. Under continuous fluoroscopy, PMMA cement (Osteopal V, Heraeus medical, Wehrheim, Germany) was manually injected using 5 -mL syringes until leakage occurred or no further cement could be injected. For group 3, three K-wires were sequentially advanced through the cut bone surface using an electric driver and positioned paramedian to the long axis of the diaphysis in a triangular configuration. <b>Osteoplasty</b> was then performed as above.|$|E
40|$|Problem What kind of {{skeletal}} differences {{do exist}} between juvenile patients with unilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate treated {{with or without}} secondary <b>osteoplasty,</b> and between cleft patients and non-cleft patients? Patients and methods Thirty-nine patients with unilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate at {{a mean age of}} 15. 8 years who were surgically treated with (n = 18) and without (n 21) secondary <b>osteoplasty</b> were compared with a control group of non-cleft patients (mean age 15. 1 years). The patients were analyzed using lateral cephalograms. Cephalometric analysis included common sagittal and vertical variables as well as measurements of anterior tooth position and soft-tissue profile. Results Analysis of lateral cephalograms revealed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups of cleft patients. The differences in comparison with the control group mainly revealed maxillary retroposition, a vertically open configuration, a steep position of the upper and lower anterior teeth and a decreased Holdaway-angle (flat midface). Conclusion Secondary <b>osteoplasty</b> exhibited no significant influence on craniofacial growth in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate. Both groups of cleft patients are not markedly different regarding sagittal and vertical skeletal configurations. No Full Tex...|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical properties of <b>osteoplasty</b> alone and in combination with Kirschner wires (K-wires) in a cadaveric human diaphyseal model subjected to 3 -point bending stress as well as to discuss implications for percutaneous imaging-guided consolidation of long bone metastases.|$|E
30|$|Percutaneous image-guided bone {{consolidation}} has rapidly {{emerged as}} an alternative to surgical fixation and is mainly reserved for patients who are deemed unfit for surgical management.

40|$|The {{surgical}} dislocation {{approach is}} useful in assessing and treating proximal femoral hip deformities commonly due to pediatric conditions. We sought to demonstrate the efficacy and problems associated with this technique. Diagnoses included slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Perthes disease, developmental dysplasia of the hip, osteonecrosis, and exostoses. Through this approach, femoral head-neck <b>osteoplasty</b> (22), intertrochanteric osteotomy (eight), femoral head-neck <b>osteoplasty</b> plus intertrochanteric osteotomy (15), femoral neck osteotomy (five), open reduction and internal fixation of an acute slipped capital femoral epiphysis with callus resection (five), open reduction and internal fixation of an acetabular fracture (one), trapdoor procedure (one), and acetabular rim <b>osteoplasty</b> (one) were performed. The average patient age was 16  years. The minimum followup was 12  months (average, 41. 6  months; range, 12 – 73  months). Patients with Perthes disease and SCFE had preoperative and postoperative WOMAC scores of 9. 6 and 5. 1, and 7. 9 and 3. 5 respectively. In patients with unstable SCFEs, the average postoperative WOMAC score was 1. 2. Seven patients underwent THAs and two patients underwent hip fusion. Complications in the 58 procedures included four cases of osteonecrosis: three after femoral neck osteotomy and one after intertrochanteric osteotomy. The surgical dislocation technique can be utilized to effectively treat these deformities and improve short-term symptoms. Although the technique is demanding, we believe surgical dislocation offers sufficient advantages in assessing and treating these complex deformities that it justifies judicious application...|$|E
30|$|The flap surgery with degranulation of {{the bony}} defect, {{decontamination}} of the implant surface, and postoperative antibiotic therapy could not achieve long-term stability [21]. In resective therapies, such as modeling <b>osteoplasty,</b> {{the success of}} the treatment depends on both the initial defect depth [22] and beginning of the disease [23]. Furthermore, the implantoplasty has been applied to smooth the supra-crestal implant surfaces [24].|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{clinical}} inadequacy of stand-alone <b>osteoplasty</b> for consolidation of long bone pathological/impending fractures [6] and the rapid implementation of numerous alternative techniques [9 – 18], {{there has been}} little evaluation of the biomechanical efficacy of these procedures. In the proximal femur, a few cadaveric studies have shown that femoroplasty effectively consolidates osteoporotic bone subjected to sideways falling [20 – 22] and may reduce mechanical stress around stance-loaded simulated femoral neck tumours provided that cement filling is adequate [23]. Similarly, the novel Y-STRUT® implant (Hyprevention, Pessac, France; designed to prevent hip fracture) has undergone pre-clinical validation, demonstrating reduced fracture risk during sideways falling [24]. In contrast, there are only three prior animal studies evaluating the biomechanical effects of diaphyseal augmentation. These illustrated a lower bending strength of <b>osteoplasty</b> alone than when combined with bare metal stents or K-wires, in porcine and bovine models with simulated diaphyseal fractures and focal tumours [25 – 27].|$|E
40|$|Background Arthroscopy is {{increasingly}} {{used to improve}} pain and function in athletes with hip joint pathology. Surgical techniques have evolved to utilise arthroscopic femoral <b>osteoplasty</b> to address potential morphological contributors to pathology. Purpose Investigate pain and function outcomes fol-lowing hip arthroscopy with and without femoral osteo-plasty in individuals with intra-articular hip pathology. Study design Systematic review. Methods A comprehensive search strategy identi-fi ed studies that evaluated the outcome over at least 3 months following arthroscopy for intra-articular hip pathology, using patient-reported outcomes of pain and/or function. Methodological quality was evaluated (Downs and Black scale), and effect sizes calculated when suffi cient data were available. Results Twenty-nine studies of moderate methodologi-cal quality were included. Of 16 studies investigating arthroscopy alone, two studies showed large effects (3. 12 – 5. 46) at 1 – 2 years. Pain reduction and functional improvement (median 47 %) were consistently reported by the remaining 14 studies up to 10 years postsurgery. Of 15 studies investigating arthroscopy with <b>osteoplasty,</b> nine papers showed mostly large effects (0. 78 – 2. 93) over 6 – 28 months. Adverse events were minimal (7 % of participants, 12 studies, predominantly transient neuro-praxia (83 %)). Conclusion Current evidence indicates that hip arthroscopy can signifi cantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with intra-articular hip pathology. While benefi ts of arthroscopy alone can persist up to 10 years postsurgery, effects of <b>osteoplasty</b> beyond 3 years need to be established. Future studies should investigate rehabilitation in this population, {{and the impact of}} sur-gery on development of osteoarthritis...|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} that <b>osteoplasty</b> {{alone or with}} K-wires augmentation does not confer any consolidative advantage to diaphyseal bone undergoing 3 -point bending stress. Fracture load was similar to controls for both composites, consistent {{with the lack of}} consolidative and stiffening effects. The stiffness of the tested specimens was slightly increased in composites from group 2 and group 3. Nevertheless, {{there was no significant difference}} as compared to controls.|$|E

30|$|Other {{studies have}} adapted {{surgical}} techniques to improve long bone tumour stabilisation. In the proximal femur, percutaneous screw fixation (simulating the inverted triangle configuration of orthopaedic procedures) [14, 15, 17] and {{placement of the}} Y-STRUT® device simulating a gamma nail [16] have been implemented to treat pathological/impending fractures in selected non-surgical patients. Early results are encouraging, although secondary fracture rates remain considerable (from 6 to 10 %) [13, 16]. In contrast, long bone diaphyseal fixation constructs have been largely improvised using interventional radiology equipment. PMMA-filled catheters [11] {{have been used to}} simulate the load-sharing action of intramedullary nails (IMN) and augmented <b>osteoplasty</b> of impending fractures. In the series of Liu et al. [11], this resulted in improved analgesia, functional status, and reduced secondary fractures compared with <b>osteoplasty</b> alone. Unfortunately, we were unable to evaluate and replicate this procedure in vitro—possibly due to lower ambient temperature, PMMA viscosity differences, and impedance of PMMA flow by the narrow catheter tip and luminal plugging with trabecular bone rather than tumour. Currently, there is insufficient biomechanical and clinical data to support these techniques.|$|E
