40|$|Ancient <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> play an {{important}} role in the Mediterranean Landscape. Many of them are more then 500 years old and characterize several landscapes in a unique way. In the last 50 years the number of Italian ancient <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> are dramatically decreasing, with a consequent change in traditional landscapes. An increasing demand in the gardening sector, a strong competition in the oil market that makes in many case unprofitable to cultivate <b>olive</b> <b>trees,</b> and the demand for new olive cultivars easier to manage, are forcing toward an elimination of these old trees. Italian legislation is trying to protect ancient <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> since 1946 making illegal cutting them. The key question we address concerns whether imposing a ban on ancient <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> cutting can result in an efficient solution to landscape preservation...|$|R

While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> at Cassibile, Sicily.

5|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis).|$|E

50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, the Mediterranean Basin is the Old World {{region where}} <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> grow.

25|$|In {{situations}} where extreme cold has damaged or killed the <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> the rootstock can survive and produce new shoots {{which in turn}} become new trees. In this way, olive trees can regenerate themselves. In Tuscany in 1985, a very severe frost destroyed many productive, and aged, olive trees and ruined many farmers' livelihoods. However, new shoots appeared in the spring, and once the dead wood was removed, {{became the basis for}} new fruit-producing trees. In this way, an <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> can live for centuries or even millennia.|$|E

The goddess of wisdom, Athena, and the god of the seas, Poseidon had many disagreements and battles between themselves, and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people, Poseidon created a salt water spring by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing naval power.
