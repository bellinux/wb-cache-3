5|$|The {{animated}} {{television series}} Rugrats {{has been noted}} for its portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Judaism,</b> a dynamic rarely portrayed in American animated programming during the series' broadcast run (1991–2004). Two episodes of the series are devoted to Jewish holidays and explaining their history, and the Pickles family is shown to be part-Jewish.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Black Hebrew {{organization}} is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations. The group {{was founded by}} F. S. Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia. Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> and Christianity, counting the Bible — including the New Testament — and the Talmud as essential scriptures.|$|E

5|$|Over 95% of Ashdod's {{population}} is Jewish; over 30% {{of whom are}} religiously observant. Despite this, the city is generally secular, {{although most of the}} non-Jewish {{population is}} a result of mixed marriages. About 100 families are affiliated with the Pittsburg Hasidic group, established here in 1969 by Grand Rabbi Avraham Abba Leifer and continued today by his son, Grand Rabbi Mordechai Yissachar Ber Leifer. Ashdod has many synagogues serving different streams <b>of</b> <b>Judaism.</b> The city is also home to the world's largest Karaite community, about five thousand strong. There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen.|$|E

5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> in Turkey {{goes back}} to the Romaniote Jews of Anatolia who have been present since at least the 5th century BC. They built ancient places of worship such as the Sardis Synagogue in Lydia and the Priene Synagogue in Ionia. The Sephardi Jews who were {{expelled}} from the Iberian peninsula and southern Italy {{under the control of the}} Spanish Empire were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire between the late-15th and mid-16th centuries. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population. At present, there are around 26,000 Jews in Turkey, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of the}} Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, {{and in the end}} she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E
5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the {{nonsense}} writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne. There is a tradition <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> in Eastbourne, and a Jewish rest home. The Islamic community uses a small mosque that was formerly the Seeboard social club.|$|E

A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> in all denominations <b>of</b> <b>Judaism,</b> which do not {{have a problem with the}} concepts of chosenness.|$|E

50|$|The diminished {{population}} of United Synagogue <b>of</b> Conservative <b>Judaism</b> and its congregations {{is seen by}} many as a symptom of a weak organizational culture in the United Synagogue <b>of</b> Conservative <b>Judaism</b> itself. A strategic plan undertaken in the 1990s was squelched when the report challenged many of the United Synagogue <b>of</b> Conservative <b>Judaism's</b> practices. In 2010, dissension reached the point at which a coalition known as Hayom ("Today") was formed and threatened to break away from United Synagogue <b>of</b> Conservative <b>Judaism</b> if significant changes were not undertaken. The creation of this coalition was in part a response to a restructuring announced by the new executive director, Rabbi Steven Wernick, without input from the field.

25|$|There {{are some}} {{movements}} that combine elements <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> {{with those of}} other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, that incorporates elements <b>of</b> <b>Judaism</b> with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that {{he is one of the}} Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect <b>of</b> <b>Judaism.</b> Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity.|$|E
