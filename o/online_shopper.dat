The study result may be useful for managers of e-vendors to understand the effect on determinants of repurchase intention and the concerns of perceived uncertainty for the different experienced <b>online</b> <b>shoppers,</b> especially when they are making decisions to extend their businesses.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} examine the antecedents of <b>online</b> <b>shopper</b> excitement, its {{consequences}} for behavioural intentions as expressed by intent to return, and positive word-of-mouth communication. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual model is developed based on the literature. Instrument item scales to measure all constructs in the model were as informed by the literature and adapted from prior studies. An online structured questionnaire survey was sent by e-mail to a UK consumer panel (n= 626). The results were analysed using LISREL 8. 7.

40|$|This thesis {{applied the}} theory of {{activity}} and goal-directed action {{to the study of}} online shopping actions. It first studied qualitatively the structures of online shopping actions using the self-confrontation interview method. The qualitative findings established the structural, cognitive and dispositional dimensions of online shopping actions including knowledge and value structures, attention processes and flow. The typical behavioural traits of <b>online</b> <b>shoppers</b> were also identified. Findings also emerged about the tensions between consumers' online and offline actions and the consequences of the technological mediation of shopping. From these qualitative findings, a survey instrument was developed to query <b>online</b> <b>shoppers</b> on various dimensions of their online shopping actions. Cluster analysis of the survey results produced a taxonomy of consumer online actions from which a typology of <b>online</b> <b>shoppers</b> was generated. The qualitative findings on the typical behavioural traits of <b>online</b> <b>shoppers</b> were then used as criteria for the qualitative usability analysis of retail websites. Retail websites of four product and service categories were analysed for their usability, i. e. ability to accommodate the typical behavioural traits of <b>online</b> <b>shoppers</b> such as propensity to experience information overload and to multi-task, potential for experiencing affect and flow etc. This thesis made several theoretical, methodological and practical contributions. It extended goal-directed action theory beyond its traditional scope of work actions and group activity to the realm of consumer behaviour. It also introduced a different theoretical framework to consumer psychology by applying {{the theory of}} activity and goal directed action to consumer behaviour.
