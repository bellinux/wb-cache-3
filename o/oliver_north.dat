5|$|<b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1985, American {{conservative}} activists {{held the}} Democratic International, a symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba. Primarily funded by Rite Aid founder Lewis Lehrman and organized by anti-communist activists Jack Abramoff and Jack Wheeler, participants included Savimbi, Adolfo Calero, {{leader of the}} Nicaraguan Contras, Pa Kao Her, Hmong Laotian rebel leader, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel <b>Oliver</b> <b>North,</b> South African security forces, Abdurrahim Wardak, Afghan Mujahideen leader, Jack Wheeler, American conservative policy advocate, and many others. The Reagan administration, although unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the idea, but both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised {{to do everything in}} their power to achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
50|$|The Western Goals Foundation was {{a private}} {{intelligence}} dissemination network active on the right-wing in the United States. It was wound up in 1986, when the Tower Commission revealed it {{had been part of}} <b>Oliver</b> <b>North's</b> Iran-Contra funding network.|$|R

5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of <b>Oliver</b> <b>North,</b> John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E

W. Bush, Lieutenant Colonel <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> and Gerrit Pretorius, private secretary to South Africa's former foreign minister Pik Botha.|$|E

25|$|Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991. It was {{developed}} by WLWT to mimic the format and look of fellow talk show The Phil Donahue Show, {{all the way down}} to Jerry's haircut and glasses, making him look like Phil Donahue (both were produced by Multimedia Entertainment). It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Abramoff joined Citizens for America, a pro-Reagan {{group that}} helped <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> {{build support for}} the Nicaraguan Contras.

This conference included leaders of the Mujahedeen from Afghanistan, UNITA from Angola, the Contras, and opposition groups from Laos. Out of this largely ceremonial conference came the International Freedom Foundation. Abramoff helped to organize, and also attended the conference.|$|E

25|$|During the Reagan Administration, Caputo helped {{support the}} president's agenda in Central America. He worked with <b>Oliver</b> <b>North</b> to foment {{propaganda}} {{as part of}} Reagan's public relations efforts in South America and in Central America. After his work for the Reagan Administration, he worked for President George H.W. Bush for his campaign in the 1992 United States presidential election. His position was director of media services on the 1992 Bush campaign. Prior to {{his work on the}} Bush campaign, he served the United States House of Representatives as assistant director of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association.|$|E
50|$|Criticizing {{the logic}} of Marine Lt. Colonel <b>Oliver</b> <b>North's</b> {{justifications}} for his actions in the affair, Inouye made reference to the Nuremberg trials, provoking a heated interruption from North's attorney Brendan V.
