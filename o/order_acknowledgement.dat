50|$|EDI {{documents}} generally {{contain the}} same information that would normally {{be found in a}} paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as request for quotation (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase <b>order</b> <b>acknowledgement,</b> shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{description}} of a real world case which focuses on a method to define the major gaps between functional requirements and existing support in a traditional ERP system. To identify and define the major gaps the method is using short interviews, existing documentation and graphic process diagrams. The report covers the process Customer Contact – <b>Order</b> <b>Acknowledgement</b> for a global chemicals manufacturer, Perstorp. The group in focus for this study is Customer Service. The results of this case were presented to Perstorp’s Customer Service as well as IT management as background material to assess improvement possibilities for both processes, IT support and for a new ERP strategy. Many other businesses are in similar situations. The aim in publishing this research paper is that these findings can be of practical use to other businesses as well as be an empirical foundation for other papers and possibly further research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Isource Business {{magazine}} states “Now, {{with the}} advent of the Internet, companies are starting to integrate their supply chains in a system-to-system manner, minimizing the need for human contact, human data entry or any sort of human involvement. ” This is the holy grail of ecommerce. It has great potential for transactional ecommerce, where XML tags can identify well-categorized data. However, how does it work for more strategic procurement functions, and how well does strategic ecommerce cross national boundaries? Some Definitions. “Strategic ” in this discussion has two dimensions. The first dimension is based on function. Strategic functions by definition exclude transactional functions such as sending <b>orders,</b> <b>acknowledgements,</b> payments and (usually) forecasts. Strategic functions definitely include sourcing, which I define as finding, qualifying, engaging and managing suppliers. We will focus this discussion on sourcing activities. The second dimension of the definition is based on the products or services procured. For this discussion, strategic products include those goods and services which directly and immediately impact the quality, cost, or delivery of products or services to customers. This obviously includes direct materials. For process industries, it can include indirect material...|$|R

40|$|Report on {{electronic}} public sector procurement The present report has been {{produced by the}} working group for electronic public procurement. The working group {{is one of the}} working groups reporting to the SFTI Drafting Committee Group. The SFTI Drafting Committee Group has been appointed to carry out the work associated with e-commerce conducted by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, the Federation of Swedish County Councils and the Swedish Agency for Administrative Development. It consists of users from the public sector as well as product suppliers and IT providers. Tasks relating to e-commerce are led by a joint steering committee group, the SFTI Steering Committee Group. The aim is for e-commerce to be applied between the public sector and its suppliers. The process shall follow message standards that have been designated by the acronym SFTI, ‘Single Face to Industry’. SFTI is adopted by the Steering Committee Group following recommendation by the Drafting Committee Group. SFTI has been formulated for several messages such as subordering, <b>order</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> and invoicing. There is, however, no SFTI for the procurement process itself. It is the task of the working group to produce source material for SFTI for the procurement process itself. An initial audit is presented in this report. The report has been written for decision-makers in the Steering Committee Group and the Drafting Committee Group. It is, however, also intended for everybody who, in some way, works with electronic procurement, such as purchasers, suppliers, software providers, etc. The report shall be considered as an initial stage in the work relating to the electronic procurement process. In section 10 of the report, there are proposals for how the work shall be pursued. A summary of the work is presented in section 1. There are three appendices to the report. The abbreviation LOU denotes the Swedish Act (1992 : 1528) on public sector procurement...|$|E

40|$|A new {{notion of}} class forcing {{was defined by}} M. C. Stanley in [6], {{which is not a}} priori definable in the ground model. In this thesis, we explore {{conditions}} under which the Definability Lemma holds for this new notion. There are two major approaches to this problem, one direct and one indirect. The direct method makes use of a new complexity class, σ 2 DFn, which lies intermediate between Σn/Πn and ∆n+ 1 in the Levy hierarchy. This class has many nice closure properties; in particular, it is “weakly ” closed under negation and bounded quantifiers, and is “weakly ” self-defining where this notion of “weakness ” is inherent in the definition of σ 2 DFn. Using this class, one can then show that this new forcing is definable {{for a wide range of}} partial orders. The indirect approach explores the relationship between forcing over an order and forcing over a dense suborder. This is trivial when these orders are sets in the ground model, but the situation is more complicated when both are classes and is in fact false in general. We prove that, even for this new notion of forcing, dense suborders produce the expected results for another wide range of partial <b>orders.</b> <b>Acknowledgements</b> ii First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Kenneth Kunen for his invaluable guidance on this work, as well as my readers and the other members of my committee.

40|$|This article reviews {{developments}} in the left-wing theory of regulation {{in response to the}} neo-liberal revolution of the 1970 s. The core of this response has been an acknowledgement of the indispensability of market <b>ordering,</b> but this <b>acknowledgement</b> has been only grudging and no positive theory of the market has emerged from regulatory proposals which concentrate on market failure. A sort of inchoate communism therefore pervades the left-wing theory of regulation, and left-wing regulatory theory and practice still lacks a coherent concept of the social market...|$|R

40|$|Some {{modifications}} of an asynchronous ring arbiter are proposed. This arbiter {{is composed of}} a chain of cells. Each cell has one to one correspondence to a device. In the chain, there exists only one privilege to arbitrate conflicts of requests from many devices. A class of modifications is high speed arbiters, obtained by {{increasing the number of}} connecting wires between two adjacent cells. As the results, the time required for the privilege to pass through a cell decreases by about one-half compared with the original arbiter. Another class of modifications is arbiters with priority rules. They are obtained by adding a few hardware to the original arbiter. The priority <b>order</b> of request <b>acknowledgements</b> in all the cells is specified. Using above modifications, conflicts of requests in many digital systems may be feasibly arbitrated...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we develop and {{implement}} a partially ordered command history for the multi-user LINCKS system. We examine two approaches of how to represent the temporal order in the command history (forward vs backward linking). The backward linking is chosen, because it results in a faster update of the command history and also contains the forward links indirectly. We define two types of commands: workspace commands and database commands. Workspace commands only affect objects in the workspace and database commands store or retrieve objects from the database. The different user sessions (LOGIN to LOGOUT) are grouped together in session objects. Temporal ordering between sessions exists as a temporal ordering between database commands of different sessions. This ordering is represented through backward links in the commands. A query function is implemented. The function takes two commands (A and B) and determines the temporal <b>order</b> between them. <b>Acknowledgement</b> I would like to expre [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We present optical, {{radio and}} X-ray data that confirm a new {{supernova}} remnant (SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) discovered using our deep H-alpha imagery. Optically, the new SNR has a somewhat filamentary morphology and {{a diameter of}} 56 x 64 arcsec (13. 5 x 15. 5 pc at the 49. 9 kpc distance of the LMC). Spectroscopic follow-up of multiple regions show high [SII]/H-alpha emission-line ratios ranging from 0. 66 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 93 +/- 0. 01, {{all of which are}} typical of an SNR. We found radio counterparts for this object using our new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 6 cm pointed observations {{as well as a number}} of available radio surveys at 8 640 MHz, 4 850 MHz, 1 377 MHz and 843 MHz. With these combined data we provide a spectral index (alpha) = - 0. 5 between 843 and 8640 MHz. Both spectral line analysis and the magnetic field strength, ranging from 124 - 184 mG, suggest a dynamical age between 2, 200 and 4, 700 yrs. The SNR has a previously catalogued X-ray counterpart listed as HP 483 in the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) catalogue. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures. Published MNRAS.
