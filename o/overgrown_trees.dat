It had two symmetrical baths, one for women and the other one for men. The hammam is composed of 15 domes with small holes which are used to let the light penetrate in. A fire that occurred in 1994, resulted with an illegal opening of three shops which blocked the old entrance. Unfortunately, a hammam that once used to be a prestigious social venue for men and women, for many years looked abandoned with only few remaining walls full of rubbish, <b>overgrown</b> <b>trees</b> and wastewaters flowing inside of the building.

50|$|The path commences at {{the eastern}} {{boundary}} of the Upper Town at the junction of Devil's Gap Road with Baca's Passage. It proceeds in a mostly southerly direction before reaching a flight of steps which link it to Green Lane, the road leading to Devil's Gap Battery. Although it was previously overgrown and in a poor condition, it was renovated in 2013 {{as part of the}} Upper Rock Management Plan to make it more accessible, in a similar way to the refurbishment previously carried out at Mediterranean Steps. As part of the refurbishment works, the path was widened by pruning <b>overgrown</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs and the drains were unclogged to prevent the path from puddling after rains. Information display panels carrying historical information about the path and on the wildlife that can be found there, together with a picnic table and waste bins designed to keep out Gibraltar's Barbary macaques were also added along the path. The Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society and the Gibraltar Heritage Trust oversaw it to ensure the work was carried out in a sensitive manner.|$|E
30|$|M 5 P tree (Quinlan 1992) is {{a binary}} {{decision}} tree that uses linear regression function at the leaf (terminal node) which helps in predicting continuous numerical attributes. This method involves two stages for generation of model tree. First stage consists of splitting criteria {{to generate a}} decision tree. Splitting criteria for this method are based on treating the standard deviation of class value. Splitting process causes less standard deviation in child node as compared to parent node and thus considered as pure (Quinlan 1992). Out of all possible splits, M 5 P tree chooses the one that maximises the error reductions. This process of splitting the data may overgrow the tree which may cause over fitting. So, the next stage involves in removing over fitting using pruning method. It trims <b>overgrown</b> <b>trees</b> by substituting the subtrees with linear regression function. In this technique of tree generation, parameter space is split into surfaces and building a linear regression model in each of them.|$|E
40|$|Artykuł prezentuje możliwość wykorzystania modeli terenu pochodzących z danych LiDAR do odtworzenia elementów historycznych fortyfikacji polowych. Podczas badań odtworzono przebieg linii okopów pochodzących z II wojny światowej na obszarze Pasma Jałowieckiego i Grupy Mędralowej. W celu weryfikacji dokładności danych pozyskanych z LiDAR i identyfikacji form punktowych oprócz interpretacji modelu przeprowadzono kartowanie terenowe z użyciem GPS. Zaprezentowana w artykule metoda badań pozwala na zidentyfikowanie linii okopów rozmieszczonych na rozległym, często trudno dostępnym obszarze, przez co wskazana jest do stosowania podczas prowadzonych badań na obszarze Karpat. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) {{data are}} very useful in geographical, {{historical}} and archeological studies. It {{is because of}} large ALS point cloud precision, which makes possibility of studying small forms in relief, such as unmetalled roads, historical agricultural systems, archaeological sites or old field fortifications, like trench lines. The aim {{of this article is}} test on the usability of LiDAR data in research of trench lines built during Second World War in Poland, in Beskidy Mountains. The study area chosen to this text was located in Jałowiec Range and Mędralowa Mountain Group in south-west of Małopolskie voivodeship, south of Poland (Fig. 1). Jałowiec Range and Mędralowa Mountain Group is a continuation {{to the north of the}} Massif Babia Góra (Beskid Żywiecki, Carpathians). The fortifications were been built in this area before and during the Second World War. The first objects were built by Polish Army in 1939 and second time there was built two large fortification lines 1944, by polish people forced to do it by german soldiers. The most objects in studied area were made on the slopes of Malikowski Groń. Objects founded in 1944 were preserved in good condition up to the present day (Tab. 1). The few objects have been transformed by the geomorphological processes and by <b>overgrown</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs on them. These objects have survived to this day, because they were not damaged during hostilities. The research was performed on a piece of trench line on Malikowski Groń (760 ma. s. l.) about 12, 2 km long (Fig. 3, Fig. 6), Lachów Groń (708 m a. s. l.) about 1, 6 km long (Fig. 3) and Mędralowa Mountain Group (1169 m a. s. l) about 2, 3 km long (Fig. 4). During the field test the plan of trench lines (Fig. 3 C, 5 B) was performed by using GPS mapping and by measurement of the size and depth of the trenches. Second plan (Fig. 3 B, 5 A) is the result of LiDAR data analyses and vectorization. After then the obtained results were compared in research analysis. The trench lines and objects are quite good visible in LiDAR data, but it is impossible to do the classification of point objects made in field observation (Tab. 1, 2, 3). However, as a general comment, it is the possibility to signing the object classes in neighbor areas by way of analogy to field testing research...|$|E
