[...] He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as [...] "palaces"; he also likened them to his [...] "living room", where he would privately entertain guests. [...] At {{the end of a}} performance, he would look at the empty stage where there was now no laughter or applause and tell himself, [...] "Tomorrow I must start again.

500|$|I {{felt sorry}} for him because he must really be stuck in the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago.

Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife. Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny-ass Nick Cannon! ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Chris {{would be shocked}} when he realises that Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich) [...] "may have a romantic interest in him." [...] During a charity camp-out, which has been organised by Scotty's girlfriend, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), Scotty visits Chris' tent and says something that makes Chris believe he is making a move on him. Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>now,</b> but Chris doesn't go for it.

[...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it.

2500|$|Jim Barber, {{a former}} A {{executive}} with Geffen {{stated that the}} new album [...] "reminded me of the best moments of Seventies Pink Floyd or later Led Zeppelin. <b>There's</b> nothing <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right <b>now</b> that {{has that kind of}} scope.

5000|$|Alder {{suggested}} that {{awareness of the}} band's previous releases informed the new album: [...] "The idea with Darkness in a Different Light was to do something similar to Parallels, not necessarily musically, but in theory. Catchy songs, big choruses—that was the idea. Sure, we sometimes think that we won't ever make an album as big as Parallels, but I think our new album is different than anything else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right <b>now.</b> We look to the future".|$|R

"Now, boys," [...] Captain Manley said as {{he crossed}} {{with them to the}} {{quarters}} of the bandmaster, [...] "you will have rather a difficult course to steer, but I have no doubt you will get through it with credit. This is something like a school, and you will have to fight before you find your place. Don't be in a hurry to begin; take all good-natured chaff good-naturedly; resent any attempt at bullying. I have no doubt you will be popular, and it is well that you should be so, for then there will be no jealousy if your luck seems better than that of others. They will, of course, know that you are differently born and educated to themselves, but they will not like you any the worse for that, if they find that you do not try to keep aloof from them or give yourselves airs. And look here, boys, play any tricks you like with the men, but don't do it with the non-commissioned officers. There is nothing they hate so much as impudence from the boys, and they have it in their power to do you a great deal of good or of harm. You will not {{have much to do with}} the bandmaster. Only a portion of the band accompanies us, and even that will be broken up when we once enter upon active campaigning. Several of the company buglers have either left lately, or have got their stripes and given up their bugles, and I do not fancy that their places will be filled up before we get <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Now,</b> your great object will be to get two of these vacancies. I am afraid you are too young, still there will be plenty more vacancies after we are once in the field, for a bullet has no respect for buglers; and you see the better you behave the better your chance of being chosen." ...|$|E
