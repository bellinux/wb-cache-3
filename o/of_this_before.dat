25|$|Today the Treaty is {{generally}} considered the founding document of New Zealand as a nation. Despite this, many Māori feel that the Crown did not fulfil its obligations under the Treaty, and have presented evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> sittings of the Waitangi Tribunal. Some non-Māori New Zealanders, including Don Brash and Michael Laws, have suggested that Māori may be abusing the Treaty in order to claim special privileges. The Crown, in most cases, is not obliged {{to act on the}} recommendations of the Tribunal; nonetheless, it has in many instances accepted that it breached the Treaty and its principles. Settlements for Treaty breaches have to date comprised {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} of reparations in cash and assets, as well as apologies.|$|E
25|$|Hood {{began to}} focus his strategy. He needed to prevent Thomas's army from reuniting with Sherman and {{overwhelming}} him, and he calculated that if he moved swiftly into Tennessee, {{he might be able}} to defeat Thomas before the Union forces could be reassembled. After Thomas was eliminated, Hood planned to move into central Kentucky and replenish his army with recruits from there and Tennessee. He hoped to accomplish all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> Sherman could reach him. His plan was that if Sherman followed him, Hood would fight him in Kentucky; from there he planned to move eastward through the Cumberland Gap to aid Robert E. Lee, who was besieged at Petersburg. On October 21, Hood's plan received the reluctant approval of Gen. Beauregard, who was concerned about the daunting logistical challenges of an invasion. Beauregard insisted that Wheeler's cavalry be detached to monitor Sherman, and assigned Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry to Hood's advance. Hood set out toward Decatur, Alabama, with the intention of meeting up with Forrest in the vicinity of Florence, from where they would march north into Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|A {{villager}} (Vichare) {{brings his}} 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) {{to a doctor}} in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes. They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child {{as a victim of}} retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E

500|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} {{significant numbers of}} barbari were recruited throughout the Principate by the auxilia (the legions were closed to non-citizens). However, {{there is little evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> the 3rd century. The scant evidence suggests that the vast majority, if not all, of auxilia were Roman peregrini (second-class citizens) or Roman citizens. In any case, the 4th-century army was probably much more dependent on barbarian recruitment than its 1st/2nd-century predecessor. The evidence for this may be summarised as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He summed it up, saying [...] "We've seen all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese {{military}}, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, seized the presidential palace. The gendarmes on duty claimed that this was but a military exercise. However, during the [...] "exercise" [...] the lieutenants dragged President M'ba from his bed at gunpoint. Bongo heard this noise and telephoned President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann {{to find out what}} had happened. Bigmann arrived at the presidential palace and asked the rebels what Bongo had asked him. At this point they opened the gates and arrested him too. The plotters subsequently arrested every member of the Gabonese cabinet except the respected technician André Gustave Anguilé. Apparently, the plotters let him roam free in the hopes of him joining them, although before noon he asked to be arrested. Joseph N'Goua, the Gabonese minister of foreign affairs, was able to tell the French Embassy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> he was arrested.|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a {{presentation}} at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, [...] "The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise" [...] and is [...] "heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses [...] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, [...] "Awesome. Or {{it would be if}} we hadn't seen all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises, which was downloaded more than 12.5million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including , 21 Jump Street and The Hunger Games.|$|E

In the midst <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>before</b> 6:30 pm, police chief Daryl Gates left Parker Center, {{on his way to}} the neighborhood of Brentwood. There, as the situation in Los Angeles deteriorated, Gates attended a political fundraiser against Los Angeles City Charter Amendment F, which was stated to [...] "give City Hall more power over the police chief and provide more civilian review of officer misconduct", and would limit the power and term length of his own position.|$|E
