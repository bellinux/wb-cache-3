Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and <b>other</b> <b>interesting</b> matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{street of}} Kuching is the Main Bazaar, {{a row of}} 19th century Chinese shophouses located along the Kuching Waterfront {{overlooking}} the Sarawak River. It offers the city's best concentration of antique and handicraft shops. The Main Bazaar is part of Kuching's old town, which also includes the Carpenter Street and India Street. The old Courthouse building, which sits in between Carpenter Street and India Street, has undergone major renovation and now houses the Sarawak Tourism Board complex. Some <b>other</b> <b>interesting</b> areas around the central business district include Padungan Street, which is the Chinatown of Kuching.|$|E
5|$|The Shroud Exhibit And Museum, {{located in}} White Sands Mall, showcases a {{full-sized}} back-lit photographic transparency of the Shroud of Turin, a religious relic believed {{by some to}} be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. They also feature a working VP8 Image Analyzer, {{the only one in the}} world where one can walk in and interact with this old analog computer. This town was founded the same year (1898) that Secundo Pia took the first photograph of the Shroud which started the modern investigation into the Shroud. This is highlighted in the museum. In 1977 in Albuquerque, they held the conference that resulted in the 1978 study of the Shroud with more scientists from New Mexico than any other state. The displayed photograph was created from the 1978 photographs made by Barrie M. Schwortz as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). The displays include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for viewing and an exhibit of electronic image analysis of the shroud, among <b>other</b> <b>interesting</b> artifacts.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, one may {{restrict}} or forbid {{the use of}} some of {{the structural}} rules. This yields a variety of substructural logic systems. They are generally weaker than LK (i.e., they have fewer theorems), and thus not complete with respect to the standard semantics of first-order logic. However, they have <b>other</b> <b>interesting</b> properties that have led to applications in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Camels are an {{integral}} part of the desert life and the camel events during the Desert Festival confirm this fact. Special efforts go into dressing the animal for entering the spectacular competition of the best-dressed camel. <b>Other</b> <b>interesting</b> competitions on the fringes are the moustache and turban tying competitions, which not only demonstrate a glorious tradition but also inspire its preservation. Both the turban and the moustache have been centuries old symbols of honor in Rajasthan.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{nonlinear}} problems {{cannot be}} posed {{in general and}} thus not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. In more than two spacetime dimensions the problem {{is related to the}} regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. This does not solve the problem in other situations. Many <b>other</b> <b>interesting</b> theories are non linear, like for example the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.|$|E

Current research studies look at the molecular and physiological basis of memory consolidation during sleep. These, along with studies of genes that may play a role in this phenomenon, together promise to give a more complete picture of the role of sleep in memory.|$|E
25|$|V. mandarinia uses both {{visual and}} {{chemical}} cues {{as a means}} of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, V. mandarinia was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when vision impairment was induced. This implies that while chemical signalling is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. <b>Other</b> <b>interesting</b> behaviors include the formation of a “royal court” consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her pheromones.|$|E
