40|$|My object here is {{to treat}} « An Episode of War » as an {{illustration}} of how irony seeps into and undermines {{all areas of the}} narrative process, calling forth a world tricked out in deceitful apparel where the drama is depleted and the inane is set into relief. I shall argue that through irony, death and conflict, the raw materials of Crane's epistemology and mainsprings to dramatization, are spiritualized into emblems. There ensues from this process a levelling off of all things, which might warrant one to contend that Crane's lethal representation conjures up a world flat as a sheet and inscribed with erasures.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{connected}} notions of memory and forgetting in the Aeneid. It aims at showing how Vergil often displays a poetic oblivion that embraces augustan political practices about the art of forgetting : the poetic design of the Aeneid is shaped by political considerations over some famous figures as Marc Antony, Sextus Pompey or Julius Caesar whose memory {{were more or less}} embarrassing for the princeps. But despite the fact that Vergil is quite obedient to Augustus’ views in his handling of oblivion in his epic, one canwonder about the formula Gallumque rebellumwhich could be a discrete but nonetheless daring allusion to the bannished elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, the former Czechoslovakia {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of Communist takeover and control. Soviet influence regulated all aspects of life in the country. As a result, many well-known political figures, writers, and artists were forced to flee the country in order to evade imprisonment or death. One of the more notable examples is the writer Milan Kundera, who fled to France in 1975. Once in France, the notion of exile became a prominent theme in his writing as he sought to expose the political situation of his country to the western world [...] {{one of the main reasons}} why he chose to publish his work in French rather than in Czech. This thesis analyzes the themes of language and memory in connection with exile in two of Kundera 2 ̆ 7 s novels, Le livre du rire et de l 2 ̆ 7 <b>oubli</b> (1978) and L 2 ̆ 7 Ignorance (2000). We contend that these concepts serve as anchors and tethers, stabilizing forces meant to help exiled characters recreate their identity outside of their homeland. By exploring notions of language and memory in these novels, Kundera demonstrates how the experience of exile affects the human condition during the latter half of the twentieth century...|$|E

Husson)) Alder decline {{caused by}} the Phytophthora alni complex {{is one of the}} most {{important}} diseases in natural ecosystems in Europe in the last 20 years. The emergence of Phytophthora alni subsp. alni (Paa), the pathogen responsible for the epidemics, is linked to an interspecific hybridization event between two parental species: Phytophthora alni subsp. multiformis (Pam) and Phytophthora alni subsp. uniformis (Pau). One of these parental species, Pau that has been isolated in several European countries and in North America, specifically in Alaska and Oregon, is exotic to Europe and a diploid species [1] [2]. Pam possesses a polyploid genome and should normally be tetraploid [2]. In this study, our aim was to determine the ploidy of the hybrid species Paa by using flow cytometry and Real‐Time PCR. Firstly, flow cytometry analysis on suspensions of zoospores allows us to compare the genome size of the three species. Secondly, we designed allele‐specific primers and probes in order to quantify the number of copy of alleles from three single copy nuclear genes by using quantitative PCR. Both results are consistent and indicate that Paa should be a triploid species...|$|E

This paper endeavours {{to consider}} {{the relationship between the}} biographer and the writer-biographee as a form of reparation for an injustice committed toward the latter and his/her entourage. I will examine three examples of biographical works—Alabama Song by Gilles Leroy on Zelda Fitzgerald, La vocation du bonheur by Karin Reschke on Henriette Vogel and Lord Byron’s Doctor by Paul West on John Polidori—in which the aim is to redress an undeservedly overlooked detail, an intentional oversight or a fundamentally mistaken assessment of the subject. In so doing, I will attempt to delimit the challenges of the biographical endeavour that seeks, from a distance, to rehabilitate historical figures as much as to denounce the forces that have marginalised them, in particular in the biographies of the so-called “heroes” of literary history...|$|E

40|$|In his 1963 treatise, Penser la musique aujourd’hui, Pierre Boulez {{proposes that}} there should be no {{distinction}} between serial materials and large-scale form. After his self-professed failure with Structures 1 a and Polyphonie X due to the incapacity of the twelve-tone series to provide form in and of itself, Boulez reassessed and expanded his compositional approach to include what he refers to as “indiscipline,” which permitted him a new freedom to modify his materials as he saw fit through a plethora of new techniques, and to link these materials to large-scale forms that take their inspiration largely from literary influences. This investigation seeks to concretize Boulez’s proposed relationship between serial content and large-scale form in “Don” (1962) and “Tombeau” (1959), the framing movements of Pli selon Pli, largely by establishing the nature of their formal organization and the origin of the serial materials used in their construction. The course of this investigation traces the developmental history of materials used in “Don” and “Tombeau” which includes analyses of materials used in the unpublished <b>Oubli</b> signal lapidé (1952), the retracted drama L’Orestie (1954 – 55), the unpublished work for solo flute Strophes (1955 – 56), the Troisième Sonate (1955 – 57), Le Marteau sans maître (1953 - 55) and the inner movements of Pli selon Pli: the “Improvisation[s] sur Mallarmé I, II, and III” (1957, 1957, and 1959 respectively). The materials developed for “Don” and “Tombeau” are largely continuations of different lineages of serial materials developed for these earlier works and form constellations of structurally related materials that persist beyond the boundaries of individual works. Taken together, the works composed during the period 1952 – 62 are the most inspired and creative in Boulez’s compositional history. The trajectory of this investigation incrementally introduces the reader to increasingly larger-scale means of organizing serial materials that culminate in Boulez’s evolving theory of discontinuous musical form. Connections among works and their organizational structure are largely derived from sketch studies undertaken at the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland...|$|E
