50|$|The {{history of}} the Bundesbank is {{inextricably}} linked with the {{history of the}} German currency after the Second World War. Following the total destruction after the war, the old Reichsmark was practically worthless, and a currency reform was implemented in the western occupation zones including West Berlin: on 21 June 1948, the D-Mark, or Deutsche Mark, replaced the Reichsmark. The currency reform was based on laws enacted by the Allied military government. In preparation, the Western Powers established a new two-tier central bank system in the occupied zones; in its federal structure, it was modeled on the Federal Reserve System of the USA. It comprised the central banks of the states (Länder) of the West German occupation zones and the Bank deutscher Länder in Frankfurt am Main, which was created on 1 March 1948. The central banks of the Länder acted as central banks within their areas of jurisdiction. The Bank deutscher Länder, whose share capital was held by the central banks of the Länder, was responsible for issuing bank notes, co-ordinating policy and various central tasks including management of foreign exchange. The supreme governing body of the two-tier central bank system was the Central Bank Council (Zentralbankrat) set up at the Bank deutscher Länder. It consisted of a president, the presidents of the central banks of the Länder {{and the president of the}} directorate (board) of the Bank deutscher Länder. Amongst other things, the Central Bank Council determined policy on bank rate and minimum reserve policy, <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> guidelines and granting of credit. After the negative experience with a central bank subject to government orders, the principle of an independent central bank was established. The Bank deutscher Länder was independent of German political bodies from the start, including the federal German government, which was active from September 1949. It achieved independence from the Allies in 1951.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long- and short-run {{neutrality}} of open-market monetary policy {{in a world}} of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. Using an illustrative portfolio-balance model, it shows that when the public discounts the future tax liabilities associated with the national debt and the central bank supports the exchange rate by trading non-interest-bearing foreign assets, <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> has a short-run effect, but no long-run effect, on the domestic price level and interest rate. When the foreign-exchange intervention assets earn interest that is rebated to and capitalized by the public, <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> loses even its short-run efficacy [...] the capital-account offset to monetary policy is complete. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a long-run {{model of the}} open economy {{in a world of}} fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. The model explicitly accounts for the wealth flow accompanying current-account imbalance and for the flow of interest payments associated with international lending. Both the dynamic and steady-state implications of the model are quite different from those of models that specify the capital account as a continuing flow responding to the level of interest rates. In particular, we find that when there exists outside government debt, <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> is not in general neutral in the long run. We also find conditions under which the central bank is able to hold the domestic price level constant {{in the face of an}} inflationary disturbance from abroad without exhausting, in the long run, its stock of domestic assets. ...|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{progress}} in restructuring {{the state sector}} since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. The Heritage Foundation states that <b>open-market</b> <b>policies</b> were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment {{and the lack of}} competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remained obscure.|$|R
40|$|As <b>open-market</b> <b>policies</b> {{reinforce}} {{global power}} imbalances, postcolonial subjects in Africa {{often find themselves}} dislocated from the promises of modernity that accompanied independence movements. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the transnational movement la Sape appropriates fashions from the metropole centres of Europe and re-enacts them in Africa, using the body as a representative surface through which to negotiate socio-economic adversity. This paper analyzes la Sape {{in terms of its}} relationship to dandyism, the gendering of performativity, and the ongoing search for an ‘authentic’ national identity in postcolonial Congo in order to explore the complex visual phenomena it evokes. In so doing, the paper demonstrates how la Sape is more than a subversive and/or passive appropriation of fashion, but rather a means by which fashion is mobilized as a tool for decolonization to produce alternate identities that resist categorization...|$|R
40|$|Chile {{presents}} an interesting case of development of information processing and technology. Its <b>open-market</b> <b>policies,</b> good education level and early adoption {{of computer technology}} have allowed its exports to become competitive on an international basis. This has been a pioneering approach in Latin-America. The Chilean software industry has had some initial success and it is attempting to grow to become an international player. It is argued that several factors must be present to reach this objective and that these elements must have innovation as a common floor. Government, Industry and universities should work in a coordinated fashion to establish these elements. Tasks {{for each of these}} actors are discussed. Finally, an assessment of the feasibility of these ideas in Chile and other countries of Latin-America is made. Note: This paper was presented in IFIP Congress 1992 in Madrid, Spain. 1 Introduction Chile, with 13 million inhabitants shares many of the cultural assets with other [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{monetary}} policy process has two stages: (1) setting {{the value of}} intermediate or final monetary targets {{on the basis of}} available information, and (2) setting the instruments of {{monetary policy}} in order to neutralize stochastic disturbances and to render the actual value of the intermediate target {{as close as possible to}} the targeted value. After becoming independent, Slovenia had to establish an independent central bank and create effective instruments of monetary policy. Slovenia did away with the nonmarket instruments of monetary policy that were used in the former Yugoslavia. Old, selective instruments of monetary policy were replaced by new instruments: an open market policy, Lombard loans, minimum reserve requirements, bills with warrants, twin bills, and foreign currency bills. Slovenia must use <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> instruments as the core instrument; the fiscal component should be eliminated; minimum reserve requirements should not change frequently due to fluctuations deriving from reserve ratio movements; refinancing policy should have a safety valve function to satisfy unexpected demand for the central bank's money. ...|$|E
40|$|Owing to its {{competitive}} labor costs, its <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> and {{a substantial}} amount of capital investments, China has become a global manufacturing pole and an export-based economy replicating the conventional Asian model, but at a much wider scale. This is creating acute competition on other Asian export-based economies such as Korea that have to adapt to the “China effect”. Consequently, many Korean manufacturing companies have repositioned their capital and equipments in China to enlarge their market potential as well as to reduce their production costs. Since Korea is adjacent to China – both are sharing the Yellow Sea Rim – this shift is creating a unique geographical dimension {{with a high level of}} functional integration of Sino-Korean manufacturing supply chains. This transition has also brought substantial changes in the regional logistic network by organizing new flows of raw materials, parts and final products, most of them along the Yellow Sea Rim. New logistic flows have given substantial influences on regional port competition by creating diverse links. These changes are bringing a reorientation of the regional maritime industry and of the port system...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{monetary}} policy implementation {{is how to}} manipulate policy so that the ultimate objectives can be achieved. Unfortunately, due to incomplete information about {{the structure of the}} economy, the monetary authorities 2 ̆ 7 policy actions are unable to directly influence the ultimate objectives. The money supply, however, is one of the important economic variables that links policy instruments to the ultimate objectives. Thus, it is necessary for the policymakers to understand how the money supply is determined. The money-multiplier model helps explain the determination of the money supply because it incorporates both policy and nonpolicy factors that affect the behavior of the money supply. ^ This dissertation addresses the usefulness of the money-multiplier model as a guide to monetary policy in Thailand. The model is developed based upon economic factors and the institutional structural of the Thai economy. To utilize this model as a guide to policy, the banking multiplier must be shown to be either stable or predictable or both. Thus, this dissertation provides empirical evidence on the predictability and stability of the banking multiplier. Predictability refers to the ability of a model to forecast the behavior of the multiplier. Stability means a strong relationship between base-money growth and money-stock growth. In addition, we examine the structure and activity of the Thai government security markets in connection with <b>open-market</b> <b>policy.</b> ^ The findings of this dissertation provide support for the predictability of the banking multipliers. In regard to the stability of the banking multiplier, the bulk of the evidence exhibits a strong link between base-money growth and money-stock growth in the long run. In the short run, however, there is some evidence indicating the dominance of banking-multiplier movements in explaining money-stock movements. But, since the multipliers are predictable, then there is little reason not to adopt the money-multiplier model as a guide aid for monetary policy in Thailand. ...|$|E
40|$|The United States {{and most}} other {{advanced}} countries are closing on five years of flat-out expansionary monetary policy that has failed in all cases to restore normal conditions of employment and output. These countries have been in liquidity traps, where monetary policies that normally expand the economy by enlarging the monetary base are ineffectual. Reserves have become near-perfect substitutes for government debt, so <b>open-market</b> <b>policies</b> of funding purchases of debt with reserves have essentially no effect. The U. S. economy entered this state because a financial crisis originating in a financial system built largely on real-estate claims came close to collapse when the underlying assets lost value. Rising risk premiums discouraged investments in plant, equipment, and new hiring. Weakened banks and declining collateral values depressed lending to households and forced their deleveraging. The combination of low investment and low consumption resulted in an extraordinary decline in output demand, which called for a markedly negative real interest rate, one unattainable because the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate coupled with low inflation put a lower bound on the real rate at only a slightly negative level. As output demand recovers, the lower bound will cease to be an impediment and normal conditions will prevail again...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry in Egypt {{is the largest}} in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region, and one that has attracted foreign investment despite the fact that Egyptian law has not always provided pharmaceuticals with patent protection. The situation changed with the signing of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS agreement” or “TRIPS”), strengthening the interest of the U. S. and other pharmaceutical companies in increasing their investment in Egypt. The Egyptian {{pharmaceutical industry}} is currently undergoing many changes spurred by the implementation of TRIPS and the globalization of trade. Many of these changes can be seen through examining the new Intellectual Property Code, which Egypt passed in June 2002 to comply with the provisions of TRIPS. This Article examines the changes in the law and the economic policies of Egypt that pertain to the pharmaceutical industry in light of TRIPS, viewed {{in the context of the}} global debates that have revolved around the effects of extending patent protection to pharmaceuticals in the developing countries. Part I of this Article introduces the TRIPS agreement and the conflicting interests of the developed and the developing countries that overshadowed its drafting. Part II outlines TRIPS provisions relating to the protection of pharmaceuticals and sheds light on how the conflicts mentioned in Part I shaped the final version of TRIPS that Members signed in late 1994. This Part also examines the anomalies of TRIPS implementation within the first few years of its coming into effect, leading to the Doha Declaration in 2001. Part III examines the new Egyptian intellectual property law enacted in June 2002 to comply with TRIPS, with particular emphasis on the protection of pharmaceuticals. Part IV takes a closer look at the Egyptian pharmaceutical industry, its size and prospects for growth, as well as the challenges it has to address. The main challenge to the Egyptian government is how to strike a balance between facilitating an <b>open-market</b> <b>policy</b> to promote investment by foreign research-based pharmaceutical companies, while at the same time ensuring adequate public access to essential medicines and promoting the development of the economic and healthcare infrastructures...|$|E
