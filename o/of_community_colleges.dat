The next president, James E. Martin, went further with the creation of the chancellor position at the university, which in effect carried the roles and duties formerly possessed by the office of university president.

[...] The statement {{is based on the}} same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships. [...] Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the community college statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and that faculty “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”.

2500|$|By the 1980s and 1990s, {{many states}} {{began to move}} away from the upper-division model. [...] Despite {{concerns}} of crowding out <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges,</b> it was felt that offering only the upper-level courses resulted in a poor public image and prevented the establishment of a full university setting. [...] Many of the students seeking to transfer from a community college desired a full college experience, including electives and extra-curricular activities. [...] The inability to reach a large critical mass prevented the upper division colleges from competing effectively with four year colleges. [...] Some upper-division colleges such as the City University of New York's Richmond College merged with community colleges, while others such as Florida Atlantic and SUNY Institute of Technology opened their doors to freshman and sophomore undergraduates. [...] very few upper-division colleges remain in the United States, with almost all merging with community colleges or converting to four year status.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 an {{agricultural}} branch of St. John’s College, called Lynam College, was opened in Stann Creek on land lent by the government. The college operated until 1971 when {{lack of funding}} and criticism {{that it was not}} fulfilling its function as {{an agricultural}} school caused its closing. St. John's Junior College grew out of the Sixth Form (1952) that was connected to the high school (1887). In 1966 it began offering associate degrees in affiliation with the American Association <b>of</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Two more Catholic junior colleges were founded in the 1990s. Muffles Junior College near Orange Walk Town was opened in 1992. It grew out of Muffles High School that originated in 1953. And Sacred Heart Junior College in San Ignacio Town was opened in 1999. It grew out of Sacred Heart High School which was the first secondary school in Cayo District when it opened in 1960. Seminarians from nearby St. Benedict's attend Sacred Heart Junior College. By 2015 the Catholic church had 148 elementary schools, attached to all of its 18 parishes and to most all of its mission stations, along with 11 high schools and 3 junior colleges. Not until 1986 did the government found a university independent of church control. There have been efforts to detach education from the British A-level system and associate it more closely to the American system of accreditation, but the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary business people resisted.|$|E
