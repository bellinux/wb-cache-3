2500|$|Planetary {{boundaries}} is {{a concept}} of nine Earth system processes which have boundaries proposed 2009 {{by a group of}} Earth system and environmental scientists led by Johan Rockström from the Stockholm Resilience Centre and Will Steffen from the Australian National University. The group wanted to define a “safe <b>operating</b> <b>space</b> for humanity” for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the private sector, as a precondition for sustainable development. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the Industrial Revolution have become the main driver of global environmental change. The scientists assert that once human activity has passed certain thresholds or tipping points, defined as [...] "planetary boundaries", there is a risk of [...] "irreversible and abrupt environmental change”. The nine Earth system process boundaries [...] mark the safe zone for the planet {{to the extent that they}} are not crossed. As of 2017,two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.|$|E

40|$|Agriculture is {{considered}} to be “climate-smart” when it contributes to increasing food security, adaptation and mitigation in a sustainable way. This new concept now dominates current discussions in agricultural development because of its capacity to unite the agendas of the agriculture, development and climate change communities under one brand. In this opinion piece authored by scientists from a variety of international agricultural and climate research communities, we argue that the concept needs to be evaluated critically because the relationship between the three dimensions is poorly understood, such that practically any improved agricultural practice can be considered climate-smart. This lack of clarity {{may have contributed to the}} broad appeal of the concept. From the understanding that we must hold ourselves accountable to demonstrably better meet human needs in the short and long term within foreseeable local and planetary limits, we develop a conceptualization of climate-smart agriculture as agriculture that can be shown to bring us closer to safe <b>operating</b> <b>spaces</b> for agricultural and food systems across spatial and temporal scales. Improvements in the management of agricultural systems that bring us significantly closer to safe <b>operating</b> <b>spaces</b> will require transformations in governance and use of our natural resources, underpinned by enabling political, social and economic conditions beyond incremental changes. Establishing scientifically credible indicators and metrics of long-term safe <b>operating</b> <b>spaces</b> in the context of a changing climate and growing social-ecological challenges is critical to creating the societal demand and political will required to motivate deep transformations. Answering questions on how the needed transformational change can be achieved will require actively setting and testing hypotheses to refine and characterize our concepts of safer spaces for social-ecological systems across scales. This effort will demand prioritizing key areas of innovation, such as (1) improved adaptive management and governance of social-ecological systems; (2) development of meaningful and relevant integrated indicators of social-ecological systems; (3) gathering of quality integrated data, information, knowledge and analytical tools for improved models and scenarios in time frames and at scales relevant for decision-making; and (4) establishment of legitimate and empowered science policy dialogues on local to international scales to facilitate decision making informed by metrics and indicators of safe <b>operating</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

In 1990 the Ministry of Cults took over the organisation of the Hacibektas festivities under the excuse of making it an international attraction. Alevis were unhappy about its interference in the programme especially in 1993 and 1994 as government officials stressed the Turkish elements in Alevism but ignored the community's specificity and did not give it any <b>operating</b> <b>space</b> as a minority community.|$|E

The stability characteristic of power system can be approximated by those attributes with high RELIEF weights, and the TSA can then be converted into a classification process in the approximate <b>operating</b> point <b>space.</b> By testing on New England 39 -bus system, we demonstrate the scheme can effectively approximate the stability characteristic of power system and perform a highly accurate transient stability assessment...|$|R
