5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> into two pumps {{for a total}} of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E

5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead}} to heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> The fluid can {{be removed from the}} pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> including {{atrial fibrillation}} and valvular disease, {{and after a}} heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> thickening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
