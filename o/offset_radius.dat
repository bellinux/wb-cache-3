40|$|This paper proposes {{an error}} {{analysis}} of reparametrization based approaches for planar curve offsetting. The approximation error in Hausdorff distance is computed. The error is bounded by O(r sin² β), where r is the <b>offset</b> <b>radius</b> and β is the angle deviation {{of a difference}} vector from the normal vector. From the error bound an interesting geometric property of the approach is observed: when the original curve is offset in its convex side, the approximate offset curve always lies in the concave side of the exact offset, that is, the approximate offset is contained within the region bounded by the exact offset curve and the original curve. Our results improve the error estimation of the circle approximation approaches, {{as well as the}} computation efficiency when the methods are applied iteratively for high precision approximation...|$|E

A beam bunch propagating through plasma excites the plasma wakefield at some conditions. The optimum wake is obtained for k_p*σ_z = sqrt(2) and k_p*σ_r ≤ 1. Where k_p is plasma wave number and σ_z (or σ_r) is RMS beam length (or RMS beam radius). But {{we are interested in}} using CERN’s long and high-energy proton beams. The CERN’s proton beams are much longer (~ 12 cm) than the optimum driving beam length (in order of plasma wavelength λ_p). Here we focus on the instability which occurs based on the interaction between beam and plasma electrons. By this instability, the long driving beam is modulated along the propagation direction, so it makes the beam satisfy the optimum size for excitation of plasma waves. What we should know is that the plasma oscillation which is initially and axi-symmetrically excited by beam head will seed self-modulation of driving beam. Therefore, we first study fundamental theories of excitation of plasma waves by the charged particle beam. It’s about the response of plasma electrons to driving beam. The driving beam doesn’t interact with and only affects plasma. Here excited plasma wakefields should be considered. As the next step, the dynamics of plasma wakefield accelerator is introduced. Evolution of beam envelope in time could result in beam centroid <b>offset</b> or <b>radius</b> pinching. Where the two phenomena, centroid <b>offset</b> and <b>radius</b> pinching of the beam in plasma are called ‘Self-modulation instability’ and ‘Hose instability’.

Given a fixed base curve, by changing the <b>offset</b> <b>radius</b> and its derivative at an end point, one can easily control the offset curve shape near the end point. To better control the offset curve shape {{in the middle of the}} curve, we use two global shape parameters (bias and tension) of the offset curve (see [16]).

The IRAC 3. 6 and 4. 5 micron data, whilst dominated by emission from old stellar populations, is corrected for small-scale contamination by young stars and PAH emission. The I band data are used to produce a mass surface density map by a B-V colour-correction, following the method of Bell and de Jong. We fit a bulge and exponential disc to each mass map, and subtract these components to reveal the non-axisymmetric mass surface density. From the residual mass maps {{we are able to}} extract the amplitude and phase of the density wave, using azimuthal profiles. The response of the gas is observed via dust emission in the 8 micron IRAC band, allowing a comparison between the phase of the stellar density wave and gas shock.

The proposed approach uses statistical shape and intensity models (SSIMs) to represent the variability across a wide range of patients, in terms of femoral shape and bone density. The approach feasibility is demonstrated by using a training dataset of computer tomography scans from British subjects aged 25 - 106 years (75 male and 34 female). For each gender, a thousand new virtual femur geometries were generated using a subset of principal components required to capture 95 % of the variance in both female and male training datasets. Significant differences were found in basic anatomic parameters between females and males: anteversion, CCD angle, femur and neck lengths, head <b>offsets</b> and <b>radius,</b> cortical thickness, densities in both Gruen and neck zones.

40|$|Theories {{of stellar}} spiral arms in disk galaxies can be grouped into two classes {{based on the}} {{longevity}} of a spiral arm. Although the quasi-stationary density wave theory supposes that spirals are rigidly-rotating, long-lived patterns, the dynamic spiral theory predicts that spirals are differentially-rotating, transient, recurrent patterns. In order {{to distinguish between the}} two spiral models from observations, we performed hydrodynamic simulations with steady and dynamic spiral models. Hydrodynamics simulations in steady spiral models demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar spiral arms (hereafter, arm-gas <b>offsets)</b> depend on <b>radius,</b> regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the spiral and the model of the inter-stellar medium (ISM). In contrast, we found that the dynamic spiral models show no systematic radial dependence of the arm-gas offsets.

This novel concept has applications in the aerospace industry where counterflow can be used to vector the thrust of a jet's exhaust, shortening take-off and landing distances and enhancing in-flight maneuverability of the aircraft. Counterflow thrust vectoring, 'CFTV' is desirable due to its fast time response, low thrust loss, and absence of moving parts. However, implementation of a CFTV system is only possible if bistable jet attachment can be prevented. This can be achieved by properly designing the geometry of the collar.

Auroral ultraviolet emission associated with Enceladus-Saturn coupling is anticipated to be just a few tenths of a kilorayleigh (ref. 12), about an order of magnitude dimmer than Io's footprint and below the observable threshold, consistent with its non-detection.

40|$|Intuitive {{design of}} the lithographic process becomes {{increasingly}} complicated in the regime of off-axis illumination and optical proximity correction. Therefore, new optimization procedures have to be introduced to facilitate the search for ideal process settings. This paper proposes mutual optimization of illumination and mask geometries using an automatic optimization approach based on a genetic algorithm. As presented elsewhere, this optimization procedure {{has been applied to}} different mask representations. It has been found that a blend of a fully pa rameterized and a pixel-based representation, i. e., a rectangle representation, leads to highly innovative solutions, but can still maintain an acceptable convergence behavior. This representation is revisited and its main principles and limitations are shortly discussed. The main focus of this paper is on a refinement of the source geometry representation. In previous versions, the general illumination setup had to be prespecified. Merely its parameters (e. g, inner and outer radius of annular illumination, number, <b>offset,</b> and <b>radius</b> of poles for multipole illumination) were optimized. In this work, the source is represented by a sector/track definition, which allows different sections of the illumination to have different transmission values. The obtained illumination geometry is transfer red into a pixel-based representation, processable by the utilized Fraunhofer IISB in-house lithography simulator. The illumination shapes achieved with the proposed approach can, for example, be produced by diffractive optics elements (DOEs). Various merit criteria determine the imaging performance of both the mask and the source settings. As the merit or fitness function plays one of the central roles in the proposed optimization scheme, individual fitness criteria and their transformation into an objective function are revisited and shortly explained.
