5000|$|During {{the first}} meeting the Round Table decided to {{dissolve}} the <b>Office</b> <b>for</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> (the organization that succeeded the Stasi), to hold elections for the East German Parliament (Volkskammer) on May 6, 1990 (in January the election was moved earlier to March 18, 1990), and to draft a new constitution, a project that was completed by a subcommittee and presented on April 4, 1990, but never discussed by the newly elected Volkskammer.|$|E

50|$|Sierra Leone's <b>Office</b> <b>for</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> (ONS) advised {{survivors}} {{to evacuate}} flood-prone areas. Additional evacuations took place when aerial {{images of a}} hillside adjacent from Sugar Loaf revealed a threat of another mudslide which could impact a much wider area. Response teams were deployed to two public schools converted into displacement centres to distribute food, water, and medical supplies. By August 16, workers in Regent and Kaningo began constructing emergency latrines and a 10,000 liter water harvesting system. Stagnant waters raised fears for outbreaks of waterborne diseases; to combat the threat, storage tanks and purification tablets, as well as educational courses on hygiene were provided by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICF).|$|E
50|$|These changes did {{not fully}} resolve the {{problems}} of the agencies. After the new services were established, President Stipe Mesić proposed appointments for the directors of the agencies, but Prime Minister Ivica Račan refused to countersign the appointments. Additional problems were caused by a lack of coordination, since documents and files had to be transferred to the new agencies. Several days before the <b>Office</b> <b>for</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> ceased to exist (on March 31), its outgoing head Tomislav Karamarko ordered all such materials to be moved to the Croatian State Archives. This gesture was a protest against the reorganization of the security and intelligence services. It also {{turned out to be a}} major scandal since the sensitive and confidential documents were not guarded at the archives, where they languished for several days before being taken to the Intelligence Agency.|$|E
