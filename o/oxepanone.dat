40|$|The title dammarane triterpenoid, C 30 H 50 O 4, {{assigned}} the name chrysura, was isolated from an ethyl acetate extract of Walsura chrysogyne leaves (Meliaceae). It has 20 S*, 24 S* relative stereochemistry and an <b>oxepanone</b> ring with two methyl groups at position 4. The two cyclo­hexane rings adopt chair conformations. The cyclo­pentane and tetra­hydro­furan rings have envelope conformations; their mean planes make a dihedral angle of 13. 1  (3) °, {{indicating that the}} rings are only slightly tilted with respect to each other. There is an intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bond in the mol­ecule, which forms S(6) and S(7) ring motifs. In the crystal, mol­ecules are linked via O—H⋯O and C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming chains propagating along [001] which stack along the b-axis direction...|$|E
