Therefore, in this paper, the tension state (tautness or slackness) <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> is considered in the forward kinematics model.

The results of this paper can be used to control sinking winches mechanism to achieve the level and stable motion of the platform, and to make the tension distribution <b>of</b> <b>cables</b> as uniform as possible...|$|R

5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from the lack <b>of</b> <b>cable,</b> Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear {{as though his}} whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
