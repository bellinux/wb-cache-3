Using the Bayesian framework, we derive the posterior probability for the number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> in a piecewise-constant density model given the data. The most probable solution is determined naturally by a balance between the likelihood function, which increases with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>bins,</b> and the prior probability of the model, which decreases with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>bins.</b> We demonstrate how these results outperform several well-accepted rules for choosing bin sizes.

30|$|For the spatio-temporal {{expenditure}} patterns, {{our study}} {{benefited from the}} formulations introduced in [2], but with minor necessary modifications. First, Diversity represents {{the extent of the}} customers’ tendency to make purchases at different locations or times. A high score of diversity means that customer spreads his or her transactions to a large number <b>of</b> <b>bins,</b> which can be considered as the slices of time or space, and will be further discussed below. Mathematically, diversity D_i is the normalized entropy of the transactions of customer i with respect to space and time slots (i.e., bins): D_i = - ∑_j= 1 ^Np_ij_Mp_ij, where p_ij is the probability of customer i having transaction in bin j, N is the total number <b>of</b> <b>bins,</b> and M is the number <b>of</b> non-empty <b>bins.</b> Our modification to this calculation was that, as the normalization factor of the entropy, we used the total number <b>of</b> <b>bins,</b> rather than the number <b>of</b> non-empty <b>bins.</b> The downside <b>of</b> using the number <b>of</b> non-empty <b>bins</b> is that it would calculate the same diversity scores, for example, for two customers evenly distributing their transactions into different number <b>of</b> <b>bins.</b> With our approach, for the same scenario, the customer evenly spreading her transactions into larger number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> can get a higher diversity score, as expected.|$|R

5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops.

The swift burial <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's body at sea, {{the speed of}} the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid.

40|$|Usually, for bin packing problems, {{we try to}} {{minimize}} the number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> used {{or in the case}} <b>of</b> the dual <b>bin</b> packing problem, maximize the number of accepted items or accepted volume.

For the off-line variant, we require that there must be an ordering <b>of</b> the <b>bins,</b> so that no item in a later bin fits in an earlier bin. We find the approximation ratios of two natural approximation algorithms, First-Fit-Increasing and First-Fit-Decreasing. For the on-line variant, we define two different bin packing problems.

5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence <b>of</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe TalbotOgden {{model is}} a mass {{conservative}} method to simulate flow of a wetting liquid in variably-saturated porous media. The principal feature of this model is the discretization of the moisture content domain into bins. This paper gives {{an analysis of the}} relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> and the computed flux. Under the circumstances <b>of</b> discrete <b>bins</b> and discontinuous wetting fronts, we show that fluxes increase with the number <b>of</b> <b>bins.</b> We then apply this analysis to the continuous case and get an upper bound of the difference of infiltration rates when the number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> tends to infinity. We also extend this model by creating a two dimensional moisture content domain so that there exists a probability distribution of the moisture content for different soil systems. With these theoretical and experimental results and using a Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS), sensors can be put in soils to detect the infiltration fluxes, which are important to compute the proper number <b>of</b> <b>bins</b> for a specific soil system and predict fluxes. Using this feedback control loop, the extended TalbotOgden model can be made more efficient for estimating infiltration into soils...|$|R
