5|$|The Wagiman {{language}} is notable within linguistics for its complex system <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> morphology, which remains under-investigated, its {{possession of a}} cross-linguistically rare part of speech called a coverb, its complex predicates and {{for its ability to}} productively verbalise coverbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} parts of speech in Wagiman are verbs, coverbs and nominals. Apart from these, there are a multitude <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> and nominal affixes, interjections and other particles. Pronouns class with nominals.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find.

The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|While Briggs held to {{traditional}} Christian teaching in many areas, {{such as his}} belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs that had to change over time. He did not believe that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses or that the book of Isaiah had a single author. In addition, he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of the future. In 1891, Briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed the Bible contained errors, a position many in the church considered contrary to the Westminster Confession's doctrines <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> inspiration and biblical inerrancy.|$|E

40|$|Research {{supports}} {{the conclusion that}} adults/adolescents employ a verbal-nonverbal consistency principle to determine whether others are telling the truth as opposed to lying (Friedman, 1978; DePaulo & Rosenthal, 1979). The verbal-nonverbal consistency rule specifies that an individual is perceived as telling the truth, as opposed to lying, when there is consistency in the affect exhibited between his/her verbal and nonverbal communication. In the study, kindergarten, second and fourth grade children were presented a) a set <b>of</b> specific <b>verbal</b> communications and b) a set <b>of</b> general <b>verbal</b> communications. After each verbal communication {{they were asked to}} indicate what facial expression the speaker would show if he/she was telling the truth and lying. It was found that use <b>of</b> the <b>verbal</b> -nonverbal consistency principle increased as a function of age. Fourth grade children showed the verbal-nonverbal consistency principle for both specific and general verbal communications by selecting facial expressions that matched the valence <b>of</b> the <b>verbal</b> communication for telling the truth and the facial expressions that do not match the valence <b>of</b> the <b>verbal</b> communication for lying...|$|R
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use <b>of</b> <b>verbal</b> cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E
