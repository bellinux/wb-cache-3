40|$|Cellobiose {{dehydrogenase}} (CDH) is {{a versatile}} bioelectrocatalyst lately at focus {{due to its}} sugar <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> in combination with its inherent ability for direct electron transfer communication with electrodes {{making it possible to}} be used in bioanodes in the enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs), self-powered biosensors, and biosupercapacitors. During the last 20 years, many new nanomaterials and hybrid nanocomposites have been developed and employed in combination with various oxidoreductases, such as CDH, to increase the overall performance of electrical devices (e. g. biosensors, EFCs etc.). It has also been shown that nanomaterials can be further chemically modified to facilitate electron transfer pathways between the biocomponent and electrodes. Both carbon and metal based nanomaterials and combinations thereof have been used together with CDH to improve the performance. In this review, we resume all the findings related to the influence of effective nanostructuration to improve the electron transfer communication with electrodes yielding higher sensitivity of biosensors or increasing the power output of EFC based on CDH from different sources...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis book {{provides}} an intuitive yet sound {{understanding of how}} structure and <b>properties</b> of <b>solids</b> may be related. The natural link {{is provided by the}} band theory approach to the electronic structure of solids. The chemically insightful concept of orbital interaction and the essential machinery of band theory are used throughout the book to build links between the crystal and electronic structure of periodic systems. In such a way, it is shown how important tools for understanding <b>properties</b> of <b>solids</b> like the density of states, the Fermi surface etc. can be qualitatively sketched and used to either understand the results of quantitative calculations or to rationalize experimental observations. Extensive use of the orbital interaction approach appears to be a very efficient way of building bridges between physically and chemically based notions to understand the structure and <b>properties</b> of <b>solids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of fluidized-bed operation and the factors affecting {{the performance of}} a fluidized-bed waste heat boiler (FBWHB) are discussed in detail. Factors included in the discussion are bed temperature and pressure, heat transfer coefficient, gas <b>properties,</b> <b>solids</b> <b>properties,</b> and tube geometry. Qualitatively, no operating or technical difficulties are envisioned for employing fluidized-bed units in waste heat boiler applications. Fluidized-bed units generally require a minimum of operating attention and maintenance and the installation of an adequate control system. A general FBWHB design methodology is presented along with a preliminary engineering design for a space heating application. A flowsheet, mass balance, and equipment sizes are presented for a FBWHB system that would produce hot water by recovering part of the heat energy contained in a hot gas...|$|R

Although PEO based polymer electrolytes are widely investigated, their use is limited by partial crystallinity.

40|$|Singlet oxygen has {{attracted}} great attention in physical, chemical, {{as well as}} biological studies, mainly due to its high reactivity and strong <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties.</b> In this context, hybrid nanosystems comprised of (inor- ganic) X-ray absorbing nanostructures and (organic) light-sensitive material (photosensitizers) can poten- tially overcome the limitations of visible light penetration in matter. A deep investigation of the interface of such hybrid nanosystems for X-ray induced generation of singlet oxygen is key {{to better understand the}} processes at the hybrid interface, and to control the energy transfer from inorganic to organic counter- parts, which ultimately leads to enhanced singlet oxygen generation. Here, we demonstrate that SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires functionalized with the tetrakisIJpentafluorophenyl) porphyrin can act as a highly prom- ising and viable strategy to generate singlet oxygen, making this novel hybrid nanosystem attractive for ap- plications in photocatalysis and nanomedical applications. Using different excitation sources (i. e., electrons, visible light, and X-rays) our findings prove that SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires show X-ray excited optical luminescence, and that optical emission of the photosensitizer is largely enhanced by the nanowires, yield- ing an efficient energy transfer. A consequent singlet oxygen production of the functionalized nanowires is demonstrated after X-ray excitation in a clinical linear accelerator. These findings will provide an insight in developing an effective route to the molecular functionalization of SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires and their potential use as singlet oxygen generators...|$|R
