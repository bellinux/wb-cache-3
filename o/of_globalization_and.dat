5|$|Language endangerment {{occurs when}} a {{language}} is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E

25|$|It may be {{said that}} the modern formal {{discipline}} of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the economic foundations of society. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as secularization, civil religion, and the cohesiveness of religion in the context <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism.|$|E

25|$|Globalization {{is often}} {{defined in terms}} of {{economic}} processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth and Volkmar Gessner - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.|$|E
