5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> circular bezel, and <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large oblong bezel.|$|E

5|$|A {{featured}} match {{heading into}} Against All Odds was the debuting of Full Metal Mayhem, in which Abyss fought Jeff Hardy, with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In a Full Metal Mayhem match, {{two or more}} competitors fight to either gain a pinfall, submission, or climb a ladder to retrieve an envelope or a championship belt in no disqualification rules. In this particular one there were two envelopes, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contract for the championship match, while {{the other one was}} empty. At TNA's previous PPV, Final Resolution, Abyss attacked Hardy after his match with Scott Hall. On the January 21 episode of Impact!, Abyss attacked Hardy once again and this time by slamming him through a table. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, TNA advertised the debut of Full Metal Mayhem between Hardy and Abyss at Against All Odds. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, the second stipulation of the match was announced, that the winner would gain a future championship match on a future edition of Impact!.|$|E

5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër {{went from being a}} predominantly Christian city to <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Muslim majority due to much of the urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
