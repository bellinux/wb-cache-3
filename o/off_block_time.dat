25|$|The Priory (or Frescati in this vicinity) Stream is now culverted {{under the}} car park but visible again {{as it passes}} a {{neighbouring}} apartment development and then passes under the main road to emerge again in Blackrock Park. The original tunnel which Emily had built to carry seawater to Frescati remains to this day; its whereabouts secret, {{and it has been}} <b>blocked</b> <b>off.</b> In <b>time</b> of threat from unexpected raids by the Crown Militia from Dublin Castle, the course of the stream could well have formed an escape route. One may notice stray cut-granite blocks which look out of place in the car park. These once belonged to the house. The remnants of Frescati are scattered now and hard to trace. The cast-iron railings were stolen, but a few fragments of plasterwork remain in safe-keeping by the conservationists. Ironically for the conservationists, more of the house would have survived if Roches had been allowed go ahead with the demolition in 1971. The stuccoed ceiling which they originally offered to retain is now destroyed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Flash {{memory is}} a good {{candidate}} for the storage de-vice in real-time systems due to its non-fluctuating performance, low power consumption and high shock resistance. However, the garbage collection for invalid pages in flash memory can invoke a long <b>blocking</b> <b>time.</b> Moreover, the worst-case <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> is significantly long compared to the best-case <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> under the current flash management techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel flash translation layer (FTL), called KAST, where user can configure the maximum log block associativity to control the worst-case <b>blocking</b> <b>time.</b> Performance evaluation using simulations shows that the overall performance of KAST is better than the current FTL schemes as well as KAST guarantees the longest <b>block</b> <b>time</b> is shorter than the specified value.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between <b>block</b> <b>time</b> and final performance for each sex in 50 -m and 100 -m individual freestyle, distinguishing between classification (1 st to 3 rd, 4 th to 8 th, 9 th to 16 th) and type of starting platform (old and new) in international competitions. Twenty-six international competitions covering a 13 -year period (2000 - 2012) were analysed retrospectively. The data corresponded to a total of 1657 swimmers’ competition histories. A two-way ANOVA (sex x classification) was performed for each event and starting platform with the Bonferroni post-hoc test, and another two-way ANOVA for sex and starting platform (sex x starting platform). Pearson’s simple correlation coefficient was used to determine correlations between the <b>block</b> <b>time</b> and the final performance. Finally, a simple linear regression analysis was done between the final <b>time</b> and the <b>block</b> <b>time</b> for each sex and platform. The men had shorter starting <b>block</b> <b>times</b> than the women in both events and from both platforms. For 50 -m event, medalists had shorter <b>block</b> <b>times</b> than semi- finalists with the old starting platforms. <b>Block</b> <b>times</b> were directly related to performance with the old starting platforms. With the new starting platforms, however, the relationship was inverse, notably in the women’s 50 -m event. The <b>block</b> <b>time</b> was related for final performance in the men’s 50 - m event with the old starting platform, but with the new platform it was critical only for the women’s 50 -m event...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> {{distribution}} for an OBS router is obtained, {{under the assumption}} of Poisson-arriving bursts with Pareto, Gaussian and Exponential burst size distributions. Analytical expressions are provided {{as a function of}} number of wavelengths per port. Such expressions can be used to dimension Fiber Delay Lines (FDLs) and to perform end-to-end delay estimation. On the other hand, we show that the <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> distribution becomes exponential as the number of wavelengths increases, regardless of the burst size distribution. Since the burst size distribution is determined by the burst assembly algorithm at the network edges, we conclude that the burst assembly algorithm will have no influence on both burst blocking probability and burst <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> in future DWDM networks...|$|R
