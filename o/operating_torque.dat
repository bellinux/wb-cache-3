40|$|AbstractThis article {{introduces}} the working principles of a spacecraft hatch including its operating process and moving trajectory. On this basis, an operating mechanism {{is designed to}} execute automatic open and close action of the hatch and measure the <b>operating</b> <b>torques.</b> Analysis on the mechanism's configuration and topological structure of each phase of movement proves {{that it is a}} typical variable freedom mechanism. The mechanism manipulates the hatch in accordance with the moving trajectory requirements through configuration transformation. Kinematic analysis and simulation of some typical configurations show that the velocity differences among mechanism components themselves and the components and their abutting components could exert influences on its working stability during configuration transformation. To solve the problem, stability conditions of configuration transformation are proposed. Appropriate control models are established for the output velocity curves of the driving servo motor and solved based on the stability conditions and rules of movement. Results from another simulation demonstrate that the proposed control models ensure smooth configuration transform and stable operation...|$|R
50|$|Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems {{the slip}} energy {{of which is}} {{necessarily}} all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than AC/DC-AC conversion based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full speed. The output shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times <b>operating</b> <b>torque</b> while the output power is output speed times <b>operating</b> <b>torque.</b> The difference between the motor speed and the output speed is called the slip speed. Power proportional to the slip speed times <b>operating</b> <b>torque</b> is dissipated as heat in the clutch.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 33 - 48 The {{successful}} {{application of}} synchronous motors requires special design consideration {{to account for}} their speed-dependent characteristics, such as the large oscillating torque levels that occur during startup.

Torsional analyses indicated that the replacement motor?s startup torque would produce unacceptable levels of torsional vibration.

In order to avoid the use of elastomerics and achieve a high performance rating of the valve (Class VI shut-off), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to predict the optimum contact geometry of ball/seating. A high accuracy contact was obtained through precision turning of the hardened metal shell (ball seating) and by grinding of its counter ball body. Both components, ball and seating, were appropriately heat treated and subsequently coated with a nanostructured diamond like carbon (DLC) coating, applied by physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques, providing superior surface strength characteristics and nearly frictionless operation.

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The <b>operating</b> <b>torque</b> split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E
