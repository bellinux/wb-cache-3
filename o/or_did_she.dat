500|$|... "Hellbound" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} David Amann and directed by Kim Manners. The entry was Amann's fourth episode written for the series, after season seven's [...] "Rush" [...] and [...] "Chimera" [...] and season eight's [...] "Invocation". Executive producer John Shiban later explained that, since Doggett and Reyes were {{in control of the}} X-Files, the producers needed to give one of them a drive. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. According to Mat Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode deals with themes of [...] "reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice." [...] Shiban noted that the conceit of the episode was whether Reyes was [...] "a good person or a bad person? Did she fight evil, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> let evil happen." [...] It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec. In mythology, Xipe Totec is often represented wearing a flayed human skin, usually with the flayed skin of the hands falling loose from the wrists.|$|E
