This thesis focuses on exploring how AR-based remote collaboration be used for supporting insurance claim processes. Previous research on remote collaboration and video conferencing have been reviewed.

It could especially facilitate the claim assessment timing and help to improve the communication between users. As a part of the prototype interface, the <b>orientation</b> <b>compass</b> plays a significant role for decreasing disorientation in remote perception.

40|$|Magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> by amphibians, {{and some}} insects, is {{mediated}} by a light-dependent magnetoreception mechanism. Cryptochrome photopigments, {{best known for}} their role in circadian rhythms, are proposed to mediate such responses. In this paper, we explore light-dependent properties of magnetic sensing at three levels: (i) behavioural (wavelength-dependent effects of light on magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation),</b> (ii) physiological (photoreceptors/photopigment systems with properties suggesting a role in magnetoreception), and (iii) molecular (cryptochrome-based and non-cryptochrome-based signalling pathways that are compatible with behavioural responses). Our goal is to identify photoreceptors and signalling pathways {{that are likely to}} play a specialized role in magnetoreception in order to definitively answer {{the question of whether the}} effects of light on magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> are mediated by a light-dependent magnetoreception mechanism, or instead are due to input from a non-light-dependent (e. g. magnetite-based) magnetoreception mechanism that secondarily interacts with other light-dependent processes...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate the effects of varying the wavelength {{of light on the}} use of an earth-strength magnetic field for shoreward orientation and for the compass component of homing. In the earlier shoreward orientation experiments, newts tested under full-spectrum and short-wavelength (i. e. 400 and 450 nm) light exhibited shoreward magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation.</b> Under long-wavelength (i. e. 550 and 600 nm) light, newts exhibited magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> that was rotated 90 ˚ counterclockwise to the shoreward direction. This wavelength-dependent shift in magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> was shown to be due to a direct effect of light on the underlying magnetoreception mechanism. In homing experiments, newts tested under full-spectrum and short-wavelength light exhibited homeward magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation.</b> Under long-wavelength light, newts were randomly distributed with respect to the magnetic field. The different effects of long-wavelength light on shoreward orientation and homing confirmed earlier evidence that different magnetoreception systems mediate these two forms of orientation behaviour. The properties of the newt’s homing response are consistent {{with the use of a}} hybrid magnetoreception system receiving inputs from the light-dependent magnetic compass and from a non-light-dependent intensity (or inclination) detector which, unlike the compass, is sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} compass of migratory birds {{has been suggested}} to be light-dependent. Retinal cryptochrome-expressing neurons and a forebrain region, "Cluster N", show high neuronal activity when night-migratory songbirds perform magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation.</b> By combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory-driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker ZENK during magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation,</b> we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus. Thus, the two areas of {{the central nervous system}} being most active during magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> are part of an ascending visual processing stream, the thalamofugal pathway. Furthermore, Cluster N seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds "see" the reference compass direction provided by the geomagnetic field...|$|R

5000|$|Reppert’s lab {{expanded}} upon Fred Urquhart's postulation that antennae {{play a role}} in monarch migration.

Reppert's lab also studied antennae in vitro and found that antennal clocks can be directly entrained by light and can function independently from the brain. Further research is needed, however, on the interaction between the circadian clocks in monarch butterfly's antennae and the sun compass in the brain.|$|R

40|$|Honeybees {{are known}} for their ability to use the sun’s azimuth and the sky’s {{polarization}} pattern for spatial <b>orientation.</b> Sky <b>compass</b> <b>orientation</b> in bees has been extensively stud-ied at the behavioral level but our knowledge about the underlying neuronal systems and mechanisms is very limited. Electrophysiological studies in other insect species suggest that neurons of the sky compass system integrate information about the polarization pattern of the sky, its chromatic gradient, and the azimuth of the sun. In order to obtain a stable directional signal throughout the day, circadian changes between the sky polarization pat-tern and the solar azimuth must be compensated. Likewise, the systemmust be modulated in a context specific way to compensate for changes in intensity, polarization and chromatic properties of light caused by clouds, vegetation and landscape. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify neurons of the sky compass pathway in the honeybee brain and to find potential sites of circadian and neuromodulatory input into this pathway. To this end we first traced the sky compass pathway from the polarization-sensitive dorsal rim area of the compound eye via the medulla and the anterior optic tubercle to the lateral complex using dye injec...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{directional}} orientation of birds {{with the help}} of the geomagnetic field under various light conditions. Two fundamentally different types of response can be distinguished. (i) <b>Compass</b> <b>orientation</b> controlled by the inclination compass that allows birds to locate courses of different origin. This is restricted to a narrow functional window around the total intensity of the local geomagnetic field and requires light from the short-wavelength part of the spectrum. The compass is based on radical-pair processes in the right eye; magnetite-based receptors in the beak are not involved. <b>Compass</b> <b>orientation</b> is observed under ‘white’ and low-level monochromatic light from ultraviolet (UV) to about 565 nm green light. (ii) ‘Fixed direction’ responses occur under artificial light conditions such as more intense monochromatic light, when 590 nm yellow light is added to short-wavelength light, and in total darkness. The manifestation of these responses depends on the ambient light regime and is ‘fixed’ in the sense of not showing the normal change between spring and autumn; their biological significance is unclear. In contrast to <b>compass</b> <b>orientation,</b> fixed-direction responses are polar magnetic responses and occur within a wide range of magnetic intensities. They are disrupted by local anaesthesia of the upper beak, which indicates that the respective magnetic information is mediated by iron-based receptors located there. The influence of light conditions on the two types of response suggests complex interactions between magnetoreceptors in the right eye, those in the upper beak and the visual system...|$|R
50|$|A {{magnetic}} compass aboard an aircraft displays the current magnetic heading of the aircraft, i.e., the aircraft's directional orientation {{relative to the}} Earth's geomagnetic field, which has a roughly north-south <b>orientation.</b> The <b>compass</b> {{can be used in}} turns to verify the aircraft is travelling in the desired direction at the conclusion of a turn. The nature of the instrument and the alignment of the magnetic pole of the earth cause the {{magnetic compass}} to have several significant limitations when used for navigation. A pilot aware of those limitations can use the compass effectively for navigation. The compass continues to operate despite failures in the electrical, vacuum or pitot static systems.|$|R
