25|$|In 1970, Haggard {{released}} A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (<b>or,</b> <b>My</b> Salute to Bob Wills), {{rounding up}} {{six of the}} remaining members of the Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny Gimble, and Alex Brashear. Merle's band, the Strangers, were also present during the recording, but Wills suffered a massive stroke after {{the first day of}} recording. Merle arrived on the second day, devastated that he would not get to record with him, but the album helped return Wills to public consciousness, and set off a Western swing revival. Haggard did other tribute albums to Bob Wills over the next 40 years. In 1973 he appeared on For the Last Time: Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. In 1994, Haggard collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album entitled A Tribute To The Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. A Tribute was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995.|$|E
