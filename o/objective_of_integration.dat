However, as the existing hegemony weakened, the AK Party has launched its project of constructing a conservative society. In order to achieve this goal, it has gradually engaged in re-articulating Turkey’s relations with the EU around the theme of the alliance of civilizations and also pushed back EU integration process in its foreign policy agenda. The secular and liberal sectors of society have argued that this change derails Turkey from the “civilizing ” process and undercutting democratization. The leaders of AK Party, in response, assert that Turkey’s goal for EU membership is still on the table but with a caveat: it is not integration with the civilization; it is rather rela-tions among civilizations...|$|E

The fuzzy logic deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than precise to solve problems in a way that more resembles human logic. For querying process the generalised logical condition in the WHERE part of the SQL was developed. In order to classify data, fuzzy queries are generated from fuzzy rules. The <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is to use the same generalised logical condition in data selection and data classification. The proposed fuzzy approach provides flexibility when users cannot unambiguously set the boundaries between data.

This data set makes it possible to examine {{the effects of}} the schemes with a differentiation according to individual differences in the participants and taking the heterogeneous labour market structure into consideration. The data set contains information about all the ABM participants who started their schemes in February 2000 and about a control group of non-participants who were unemployed in January 2000 and did not enter the schemes in February 2000. With the aid of the information in the employment statistics it is possible here for the first time to examine the outflow into regular employment on the basis of administrative data. The study period ends in December 2002. Using matching methods the effects of job-creation measures are estimated with a regional differentiation and for particular problem and target groups of the labour market.

The authors highlight the points that define the importance of the issues in the formulation of the state policy in the sphere of education. Materials and Methods: the research methodology is based on the general scientific analysis of scientific literature and empirical data. The authors used the relevant works by Russian and foreign researchers, and legal documenta¬tion of the Russian higher education. Results: the analysis of the term “integration” from the perspective of fundamental science and in relation to the practice of the higher school allowed us to distinguish between the state and the process of the above term. Con¬sideration of the ongoing integration processes in the field of higher education allowed us to identify three levels of their manifestation. Discussion and Conclusions: the authors come to the conclusion about the necessity of distinguishing approach to the research of integration processes due to the differences between the forms of integration manifestations at various levels; present visual distinction of the notion “integration” in respect to levels of its manifestation; as the cause of integration processes the authors indicate the desire to win the competition, but as the main <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> – to increase the competitiveness of the participants involved in integration processes, ensuring their joint progress...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proved that}} cloud {{computing}} has many benefits, and cloud services with flexible licensing model and cost saving features bring opportunities to enterprise's IT operations. Conventional ERP system, {{an important component}} of enterprises, is impacted by on-demand cloud services also. Integrating conventional ERP system with cloud services becomes a trend because it brings new processing capabilities without introducing significant changes to existing system. But previous studies about integrating ERP and cloud usually focused on SaaS (Software as a Service). PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) are not discussed much. People sometimes even confuse cloud service with SaaS. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} present a framework that can describe respective implications of integrating ERP with three types of cloud services: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Qualitative methods such as systematic literature review and interviews are adopted to execute the research, so data collected through different sources can complement each other in order to support presenting the framework of integrating conventional ERP system and cloud services. The integration at SaaS level is for achieving immediate business value and productivity enhancement. At PaaS level the <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is to enhance software development life cycle management. And the main integrating intent at IaaS level is to enable scalability and reliability of hardware resources without changing existing IT infrastructure. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities for integrating ERP with different cloud services are studied and motivation is derived from analyzing. Finally the key points are arranged in the presented framework of integration between conventional ERP systems and cloud services...|$|E
40|$|Even {{compared}} with other developed countries, Japan’s population is aging at an exceptionally high rate {{and the proportion of}} those aged 65 and older already exceeds 20 percent of the total population. The rapid aging of the population is inevitably accompanied by a growing demand for long-term care, resulting in increased pressures on the current social insurance scheme. This abstract provides an overview of Japan’s long-term care (LTC) insurance program and the related empirical literature to evaluate how the program measures up to its goals. The LTC insurance scheme was introduced in April 2000 to supplement the mandatory national health care system established in 1961. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the new scheme pursued three major goals. First, it aimed to address widespread concerns related to aging, in partic-ular the burden caring for the elderly imposes on families. In effect, the intro-duction of the scheme signals the recognition that the responsibility of care is shifting from the family to the government and the measure tries to address the supply shortage in the care for the elderly. Second, the reform sought to make more transparent the relationship between benefits received and premiums paid. Until 2000, under the “distribution system”, the provision of care for the elderly was part of the government’s tax-financed welfare policy and those eligible were assigned to nonprofit providers. As a result of the reform, there is now a clearer relationship between the financing of care services via premiums and eligibil-ity. A third aim of the new scheme was to integrate health, medical and welfare services, which in the past were vertically divided and operated independently. The <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> was to encourage the provision of comprehensiv...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} quantify water storages and fluxes in water management systems through observations or models is of increasing importance {{due to the}} expected impacts from climate change and population growth worldwide. Here, I describe three innovative techniques developed to better understand this problem. First, a model was created to represent reservoir storage and outflow with the <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> into a Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the impacts of reservoir management on the climate system. Given this goal, storage capacity represented the lone model input required that is not already available to an LSM user. Model parameterization was linked to air temperature to allow future simulations {{to adapt to a}} changing climate, making it the first such model to mimic the potential response of a reservoir operator to climate change. Second, spatial and temporal error properties of future NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite reservoir operations were quantified. This work invoked the use of the SWOTsim instrument simulator, which was run over a number of synthetic and actual reservoirs so the resulting error properties could be extrapolated to the global scale. The results provide eventual users of SWOT data with a blueprint of expected reservoir error properties so such characteristics can be determined a priori for a reservoir given knowledge about its topology and anticipated repeat orbit pass over its location. Finally, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission was used in conjunction with in-situ water use records to evaluate sustainable water use at the two-digit HUC basin scale over the contiguous United States. Results indicate that the least sustainable water management region is centered in the southwest, where consumptive water use exceeded water availability by over 100 % on average for some of these basins. This work represents the first attempt at evaluating sustainable water use using exclusively remote sensing and in-situ observations at the continental scale, and offers a framework for future similar studies attempting to evaluate water use sustainability at large scales...|$|E
40|$|More and more, {{vocational}} training {{is considered by}} public action {{to be the key}} resource in order to achieve the <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> of people in difficulty on the labour market (Guitton 1998, Lallement 2006). The strategy consists of making the development of human capital and of individual qualifications the principle tool to improve job security and to make workers more competitive on the job market (Gazier 2006). Vocational training is considered a crucial resource to decrease exposures to unemployment and to equip people with durable and recognizable resources. This contribution proposes to analyse the role of the training policies into the process of socio-professional insertion of the immigrants into the regional (PACA) labour market. A qualification could represent an opportunity to integrate a productive sector, but it could also be seen as a « career mobility chance » (Zucchetti, 2000) which catalyses the working status evolution of the immigrant (from an “informal” employment to a regular one; from a dependent position to an entrepreneurial activity etc.). However, if a strong link between {{vocational training}} and professional insertion policies is visible, it is difficult to find, within the public action, a clear connection between vocational training and the immigrants policies. Does it deal with a French specificity in the political formalisation of problems, that ignores ethnic categories (Guiraudon 2006, De Rudder, Poiret, Vourc'h 2000) ? Or are the immigrants conceived as a non-qualified workforce which supplies to sector needs, where qualification doesn't play a fundamental role (Gélot and Minni, 2006) ? The case of the construction sector seems to be revealing: what is the relevance of the immigrant workforce in PACA? What kind of socio-professional insertion does the sector offer to the immigrants? What possibilities of ascending mobility do immigrants have? What kind of “integration through work” (Castel 1995, Paugam 2000) is accessible to the immigrants employed in this sector? We focus on the construction sector case through the analysis of the branch policies and of the instruments of actors (Lascoumes et Le Galès, 2005) at a local level, in order to define the specificity of the sector needs and of its vocational training offer. At what level the “immigrant issue” plays its hand and becomes an observable element of the local debate? Are immigrants the recipients of specific actions or are they concerned by general policies aimed at the resolution of the qualification needs of the sector? The contribution will propose some interpretations to be discussed...|$|E
