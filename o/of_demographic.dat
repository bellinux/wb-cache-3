In 2005 the median personal income, the amount earned {{by the average}} Joe or average Jane, is largely determined by who is or who {{is not included in}} the statistics. Personal income statistics are given in accordance to a variety <b>of</b> <b>demographic</b> characteristics. The median income for all 233 million persons over the age of 15 was $28,567.|$|E

Membership dropped significantly in the 1930s because of the Depression, grew after World War II, and dropped again in the 1960s and 1970s as a result <b>of</b> <b>demographic</b> shifts. Programs for young children helped draw Jewish families back into the neighborhood and revitalize the membership.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is {{in a state}} <b>of</b> <b>demographic</b> crisis. It has had {{negative}} {{population growth}} since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have {{children under the age of}} 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495. The document is an important source <b>of</b> <b>demographic,</b> economic, and cultural research of late medieval Hungary. The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax assessed in Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 {{which was to be}} paid by each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of the southern border, was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax assessed in this region. The peasants in southern Slavonia were also exempt from the one-florin tax because of the frequent Ottoman raids in this region.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an ambivalent {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike. After independence, Lima became {{the capital of the}} Republic of Peru. It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid-19th century until the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period <b>of</b> <b>demographic</b> expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed {{to keep up with the}} city expansion.|$|E

Notestein developed a more formal theory <b>of</b> <b>demographic</b> transition. By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had {{become one of the most}} widely accepted findings in social science.|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the constant warfare between Hungarians and Ottoman Turks, population growth was stunted and the network of medieval settlements with their urbanized bourgeois inhabitants perished.

Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes lead to lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher per-capita income, higher female income, lower mortality, old-age security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.|$|E
