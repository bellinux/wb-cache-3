5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E

Plaque {{is made up}} of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. The narrowing of arteries limits the flow of <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> to parts of the body. Diagnosis is based upon a physical exam, electrocardiogram, and exercise stress test among others.|$|E
25|$|Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a {{congenital}} heart {{defect in}} which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart. Normally, the atria {{are separated by}} a dividing wall, the interatrial septum. If this septum is defective or absent, then <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> can flow directly {{from the left side}} of the heart to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart, or vice versa. This can lead to lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small.|$|E

50|$|In {{a normal}} heart, oxygen-depleted blood ("blue") is pumped {{from the right}} side of the heart, through the {{pulmonary}} artery, to the lungs where it is oxygenated. This is the pulmonary circulation part of <b>blood</b> flow. The <b>oxygen-rich</b> ("red") <b>blood</b> then returns to the left heart, via the pulmonary veins, and is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, including the heart muscle itself. This is the systemic circulation part of blood flow, the other loop of an interconnected normal -pulmonary system.|$|R
25|$|The fMRI concept {{builds on}} the earlier MRI {{scanning}} technology and the discovery of properties of <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood.</b> MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, static magnetic field to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei {{go back to their}} original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate the positions of the nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{pancreatitis}} {{can cause}} organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people {{will need to}} be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock can be life-threatening as it can very quickly starve the body of the <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> that it needs to survive. To avoid going into hypovolemic shock, fluids will be pumped intravenously. Oxygen will be supplied through tubes attached to the nose and ventilation equipment may be used to assist with breathing. Feeding tubes may be used to provide nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia.|$|E
2500|$|Author John Curra wrote, [...] "The carotid arteries (on {{either side}} of the neck) carry <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in {{strangulation}} or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of carbon dioxide can increase feelings of giddiness, lightheadedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations." ...|$|E
25|$|Since the 1890s it {{has been}} known that changes in blood flow and blood {{oxygenation}} in the brain (collectively known as hemodynamics) are closely linked to neural activity. When neurons become active, local blood flow to those brain regions increases, and <b>oxygen-rich</b> (oxygenated) <b>blood</b> displaces oxygen-depleted (deoxygenated) blood around 2 seconds later. This rises to a peak over 4â€“6 seconds, before falling {{back to the original}} level (and typically undershooting slightly). Oxygen is carried by the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells. Deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) is more magnetic (paramagnetic) than oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), which is virtually resistant to magnetism (diamagnetic). This difference leads to an improved MR signal since the diamagnetic blood interferes with the magnetic MR signal less. This improvement can be mapped to show which neurons are active at a time.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{is similar to}} MRI but uses the change in magnetization between <b>oxygen-rich</b> and oxygen-poor <b>blood</b> as its basic measure. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources and hence statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be presented graphically by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds.|$|R
40|$|Invited {{special edition}} on Australasia and Bio-EngineeringThe Circle of Willis is a ring-like {{structure}} {{of blood vessels}} {{at the base of}} the brain that distributes <b>oxygen-rich</b> arterial <b>blood</b> to the cerebral mass at a specific rate. One dimensional (1 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models of the Circle of Willis have been created to simulate clinical scenarios, such as stenoses and occlusions in afferent arteries. Both models capture cerebral haemodynamic auto-regulation using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to modify efferent artery resistances to maintain optimal efferent flow rates for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. Auto-regulatory control is decentralised so that each individual territory of the cerebral mass regulates flow to satisfy its requirements independent of the remaining territories. Results show that if a sudden occlusion is imposed in an afferent artery, efferent flux profiles fluctuate as an equilibrium is found that best satisfies the independent requirements of each territory of the cerebral mass. Clinically, this unique insight into the transient dynamics of cerebral blood flow and auto-regulation will enable pre-surgical scenario testing using simple models to minimise stroke risk...|$|R
2500|$|Oxygen {{deprived}} {{blood from}} the superior and inferior vena cava enters the right atrium {{of the heart and}} flows through the tricuspid valve (right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs, whereby [...] is released from the blood, and oxygen is absorbed. The pulmonary vein returns the now <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> to the left atrium.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Charles Roy and Charles Sherrington first {{experimentally}} linked {{brain function}} to its blood flow, at Cambridge University. The next step to resolving {{how to measure}} {{blood flow to the}} brain was Linus Pauling's and Charles Coryell's discovery in 1936 that <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> with Hb was weakly repelled by magnetic fields, while oxygen-depleted blood with dHb was attracted to a magnetic field, though less so than ferromagnetic elements such as iron. Seiji Ogawa at AT Bell labs recognized that this could be used to augment MRI, which could study just the static structure of the brain, since the differing magnetic properties of dHb and Hb caused by blood flow to activated brain regions would cause measurable changes in the MRI signal. BOLD is the MRI contrast of dHb, discovered in 1990 by Ogawa. In a seminal 1990 study based on earlier work by Thulborn et al., Ogawa and colleagues scanned rodents in a strong magnetic field (7.0T) MRI. To manipulate blood oxygen level, they changed the proportion of oxygen the animals breathed. As this proportion fell, a map of blood flow in the brain was seen in the MRI. They verified this by placing test tubes with oxygenated or deoxygenated blood and creating separate images. They also showed that gradient-echo images, which depend on a form of loss of magnetization called T2* decay, produced the best images. To show these blood flow changes were related to functional brain activity, they changed the composition of the air breathed by rats, and scanned them while monitoring brain activity with EEG. The first attempt to detect the regional brain activity using MRI was performed by Belliveau and others at Harvard University using the contrast agent Magnevist, a ferromagnetic substance remaining in the bloodstream after intravenous injection. However, this method is not popular in human fMRI, because any medically unnecessary injection is to a degree unsafe and uncomfortable, and because the agent stays in the blood only for a short time.|$|E

40|$|The Circle of Willis is a ring-like {{structure}} {{of blood vessels}} found beneath the hypothalamus {{at the base of}} the brain. Its main function is to distribute <b>oxygen-rich</b> arterial <b>blood</b> to the cerebral mass. A one-dimensional model of the Circle of Willis has been created to simulate a series of possible clinical scenarios such as occlusions in afferent arteries, absent or string-like circulus vessels, or arterial infarctions. The model captures cerebral haemodynamic auto-regulation by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to modify efferent resistances and maintain optimal efferent flowrates for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. Results match limited clinical data and results obtained in prior studies to within 6 %. In addition, a set of boundary conditions and geometry is presented for which the auto-regulated system cannot provide the necessary efferent flowrates and perfusion, representing a condition with increased risk of stroke and highlighting the importance of modelling the haemodynamics of the Circle of Willis.

40|$|The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a ring-like {{structure}} {{of blood vessels}} found {{at the base of}} the brain. Its main function is to distribute <b>oxygen-rich</b> arterial <b>blood</b> to the cerebral mass. In a previous study, a one dimensional model of the CoW was created to simulate a series of possible clinical scenarios such as occlusions in afferent arteries, absent or string-like circulus vessels, or arterial infarctions. The model captured cerebral haemodynamic autoregulation by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to modify arterial resistances. Although some good results and correlations were achieved, the model was too simple to capture all the transient dynamics of autoregulation. Hence, a more physiologically accurate model has been created that additionally includes the oxygen dynamics that drive the autoregulatory response. Results very closely match accepted physiological response and limited clinical data. In addition, a se 4 t of boundary conditions and geometry is presented for which the autoregulated system cannot provide sufficient perfusion, representing a condition with increased risk of stroke and highlighting the importance of modelling the haemodynamics of the CoW.

One-dimensional (1 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models of the Circle of Willis have been created to provide a simulation tool which could be used to replicate clinical scenarios, such as occlusions in afferent arteries and absent circulus vessels. Both models capture cerebral haemodynamic auto-regulation using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to modify efferent artery resistances to maintain optimal efferent flowrates for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. The models can be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions prior to surgery or other clinical procedures. The 1 D model is particularly relevant in this instance, with its fast solution time suitable for real-time clinical decisions. Results show excellent correlation between models for the transient efferent flux profile. The assumption of strictly Poiseuille flow in the 1 D model allows more flow through the geometrically extreme communicating arteries than the 3 D model. This discrepancy was overcome by increasing the resistance to flow in the Anterior Communicating Artery in the 1 D model to better match the resistance seen in the 3 D results...|$|R

50|$|With d-TGA, certain major {{blood vessels}} are {{connected}} improperly, so oxygen-poor {{blood from the}} right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to {{the body and the}} heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. This is a life-threatening situation due to the resultant low oxygen levels throughout the body. Atrial septostomy allows more of the <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>blood</b> to circulate throughout the body.

40|$|The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a ring-like {{structure}} {{of blood vessels}} found {{at the base of}} the brain. Its main function is to distribute a constant flow <b>oxygen-rich</b> arterial <b>blood</b> to the cerebral mass, despite changes in afferent pressures or flows. This objective is achieved by a local mechanism known as autoregulation, whereby the resistance in small vessels branching from the CoW changes by vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. A one-dimensional (1 D) model of the CoW is developed to simulate a series of possible clinical scenarios such as occlusions in afferent arteries, absent or string-like circulus vessels, or arterial infarctions. A series of studies investigates various features of autoregulatory behaviour. Firstly, a simple model is created to verify solution methods; secondly, the model is validated against a three-dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model; and lastly, the decentralised nature of cerebral autoregulation is investigated. Finally, an advanced, metabolic model of autoregulation is created, incorporating the successful aspects of the early model, as well as more physiologically accurate dynamics. The advanced model captures cerebral haemodynamic autoregulation by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to modify efferent artery resistances and partial pressures of oxygen to maintain optimal efferent flow rates and oxygen supply to the cerebral mass for a given circle geometry and afferent blood pressure. This advanced model is physiologically relevant, matching the accepted physiological responses of blood flow as a function of arterial pressure, tissue oxygen partial pressure as a function of blood flow, as well as limited transient clinical data. Results match accepted physiological response and exhibit excellent correlation with the limited clinical data available. In addition, a set of boundary conditions and geometry is presented for which the autoregulated system cannot provide the necessary efferent flow rates and perfusion, representing a condition with increased risk of stroke and highlighting the importance of modelling the haemodynamics of the Circle of Willis. The system model created is computationally simple so it can be used to identify at-risk cerebral arterial geometries and conditions prior to surgery or other clinical procedures. In addition, the solution for the CoW arterial system is obtained in a far shorter time period using this time-varying resistance model than with higher dimensional CFD methods, and requires significantly less computational effort while retaining a high level of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{blood vessels}} in the chick chorioallantoic {{membrane}} were selectively coagulated through photothermolysis, using pulsed laser irradiation at 585 nm. Pulse durations were chosen to be 0. 45 ms and 10 ms, which correspond to the thermal relaxation times in blood vessels of 30 Î¼m and 150 Î¼m diameter, respectively. The short pulses, at a light fluence F = 3 Jcm - 2, caused permanent occlusion of vessels of 40 Î¼m diameter or less, whereas larger caliber vessels (60 - 120 Î¼m) required F = 4 - 5 Jcm - 2. The long-duration pulses, at F = 7 Jcm - 2, caused coagulation of the larger diameter vessels; the small-caliber vessels and capillaries showed resistance to photothermolysis and required multiple exposures to achieve coagulation. The fluence versus diameter (F versus d) relationship for coagulation was calculated for the two pulse durations. The energy deposited in a cylindrical absorber of diameter d by an optical field, incident perpendicular to the vessel, was expressed analytically and compared with the energy required to coagulate a blood vessel of the same lumen diameter. When thermal diffusion is incorporated into the model, our findings can be accounted for quantitatively. This information will be of use for improving the laser treatment of port wine stains and other vasculopathies. A surprising observation was that arterioles were damaged at lower incident energy densities than venules having the same lumen diameter, despite the fact that absorbance in <b>oxygen-rich</b> and oxygen-poor <b>blood</b> is the same at 585 nm.
