40|$|Chip I/O pins are an {{increasingly}} limited resource and significantly affect the performance, power {{and cost of}} multicore processors. <b>Optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> promise low power and high bandwidth, and are potential alternatives to electrical interconnects. This work systematically developed a set of analytical models for electrical and <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> to study their structures, receiver sensitivities, crosstalk noises, and attenuations. We verified the models by published implementation results. The analytical models quantitatively identified the advantages of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> in terms of bandwidth, energy consumption, and transmission distance. We showed that <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> can significantly reduce chip pin counts. For example, compared to electrical <b>interconnects,</b> <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> can save at least 92 % signal pins when connecting chips more than 25 cm (10 inches) apart.

However, {{the problems of}} flow control and buffering inhibit current parallel architectures from effectively exploiting the advantages of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects.</b> We propose using an execution model, called Single Program, Single Data stream (SPSD) to exploit inexpensive optical broadcasts and reduce the serial overheads of parallel programs.

40|$|The CMOS IC {{industry}} {{thrives on}} the down-scaling drive for ever smaller transistors, leading to faster, {{smaller and more}} complex digital systems. These ICs are interconnected by electrical tracks running on Printed Circuit Boards. Due to different frequency-dependent sources of signal degradation, the performance of these electrical interconnects lags behind the IC performance. As the electrical interconnect bottleneck increasingly impacts overall system performance, the interest in <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> at the inter-chip level is growing. An important question to answer is how and where such <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> should be implemented. Therefore, we first discuss the weaknesses of electrical interconnects and {{the potential benefits of}} <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects.</b> From this we then consider the implications on the introduction of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> and we argue why integration is of key importance for the successful introduction of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> at this level.

50|$|Today the {{requirements}} for and use of TCAD cross-cut a very broad landscape of design automation issues, including many fundamental physical limits. At the core are still a host of process and device modeling challenges that support intrinsic device scaling and parasitic extraction. These applications include technology and design rule development, extraction of compact models and more generally design for manufacturability (DFM).The dominance of interconnects for giga-scale integration (transistor counts in O(billion)) and clocking frequencies in O (10 gigahertz)) have mandated the development of tools and methodologies that embrace patterning by electro-magnetic simulationsâboth for optical patterns and electronic and <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> performance modelingâas well as circuit-level modeling. This broad range of issues at the device and interconnect levels, including links to underlying patterning and processing technologies, is summarized in Figure 1 and provides a conceptual framework for the discussion that now follows.|$|E
