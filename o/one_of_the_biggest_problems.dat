5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> for filming is the {{environmental}} impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of}} the first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{facing the}} early power {{companies}} was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high {{during the first}} hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{was that}} the three button Xerox mouse cost over US$400 to build, which was not {{practical}} for a consumer-based personal computer. Apple commissioned Hovey-Kelley Design (which later became IDEO) to assist them with the mouse design, which not only had to be redesigned to cost US$25 instead of US$400, but also needed to be tested with real consumers outside a laboratory setting to learn how people were willing to use it. Hundreds of prototypes later, Apple settled on a single button mouse, {{roughly the size of}} a deck of cards. With the design complete, the operating system was adapted to interface with the single button design using keystrokes in combination with button clicks to recreate some of the features desired from the original Xerox three-button design.|$|E
25|$|William A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen {{living in}} Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{proposed}} using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899 took Hedley to South Africa with 17 Field Company. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> facing the British {{was the lack of}} suitable maps, so his surveying experience was in demand. He arrived in South Africa in November 1899, he was present at the Relief of Ladysmith, and was Mentioned in Despatches in a despatch dated 30 March 1900, though this was not gazetted until February 1901. The same Gazette carried a further Mention in a despatch dated 9 November 1900. He had been hospitalised earlier in 1900, and was discharged to return to duty in the week ending 18 May 1900. He received a third Mention in September 1901 for service up to April 1901. On 9 July 1901 he left Port Natal on the transport City of Cambridge which was due to arrive at Southampton on 3 August. His obituary in The Times records that he served in the Boer War until 1902, so he may have returned at a later date. In September 1901 it was gazetted that he had received brevet promotion to major for his South African service on 29 November 1900; substantive promotion to that rank came on 18 January 1902. He also received the Queen's South Africa Medal, with six clasps, for his service during the Boer War.|$|E

500|$|Justin Pacheco of The Good 5 Cent Cigar {{compared}} it to [...] "I Don't Believe You", saying, [...] " [...] exemplifies the sappy ballad [...] and would not seem out of place being sung by any other big pop singer. 'Glitter in the Air' is another big pop ballad along the same the same lines". Patrick Ferrucci of the New Haven Register commented in the album review that [...] "She does get a little wishy-washy though, going from tunes like 'Mean' and 'It's All Your Fault' to 'Please Don't Leave Me' and 'Glitter in the Air'". He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine stated that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> in Funhouse was its songwriting, saying, [...] "'Glitter in the Air,' with its emo-esque [...] "You called me sugar" [...] bridge, is overwrought with its clichéd imagery".|$|E
500|$|To {{move all}} the stones, Byne and Steilberg had a road built to the Tagus, and a barge {{attached}} to a fixed cable was assigned to ferry stones across. An old World War I trench railway {{was brought in to}} transport stones from the monastery to the ferry; its rails could be laid into any of the buildings. Men pushed the small rail cars along the narrow gauge tracks; the stones were then lifted into the ferry by crane, and another crane lifted them out of the ferry into trucks. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> that Byne encountered was that Spain's three excelsior factories could not make enough packing material to keep the crate-packing crew supplied. At one point, realizing that the stones were likely to be used in California as external cladding for structural steel walls, Steilberg suggested the facing surface of each stone be sliced to a [...] "veneer" [...] of the thickness of [...] for easier packing and shipping, but Hearst wanted to retain the authenticity of the full-sized stones. Byne and Steilberg judged certain walls and utility buildings worthless and left them in Spain. Steilberg returned {{home at the end of}} March.|$|E
500|$|When {{adapting}} the characters for film, Thompson {{found that in}} the novel, [...] "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," [...] and that [...] "making the male characters effective was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems.</b> Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions." [...] Several major male characters in Sense and Sensibility were consequently altered significantly from the novel {{in an effort to}} appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are [...] "ideal" [...] modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as [...] "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.|$|E

2500|$|The Dupont Plaza Hotel {{fire and}} other fires {{of the era}} gave rise to several {{amendments}} to security policies in hotels around the world. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{at the time was}} the lack of standard fire safety requirements.

The fire alarm system in the tower was not working, and many guests were not aware of the fire until they saw or smelled it, heard someone shouting [...] "Fire", or heard firefighters responding. In 1987, there were four major fire codes across the United States with over 1,800 variations because of local codes and ordinances, with one code having significant fire protection requirements, and another having nothing.|$|E

2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{faced by}} the TAIU teams was Allied troops, who {{commonly}} stripped enemy aircraft for [...] "souvenirs". Efforts were made to minimize indiscriminate souvenir hunting and troops were encouraged to turn in all captured items and report enemy aircraft wrecks. Most of these efforts were in vain, and it remained a constant problem throughout the war. Another obstacle was that most Japanese aircraft fell into the ocean, and those that did not often crashed in isolated areas that were difficult to reach. As an example, a newly developed Yokosuka D4Y [...] "Judy" [...] dive bomber with an in-line engine crashed six miles inland, on a [...] hill, on Santa Isabel Island. The TAIU had to recruit local men to cut a trail to the crash site with machetes, and then carry out the engine on a cradle woven from tree bark.|$|E
