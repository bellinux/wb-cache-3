5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> instability, with three chief {{executives}} in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Wormull {{returned}} home to join Crawley, on much reduced wages, but he failed his medical examination; the club initially offered him a short-term deal while he proved his fitness. At {{the end of the}} 2004–05 season he agreed a two-year contract. He turned down offers of full-time football, preferring to stay near home and combine his playing role with running the club's new youth coaching scheme in local schools. A succession <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> changes following the club's takeover resulted in Wormull acting as caretaker manager for four matches in November 2005, a role in which he made a positive start. During this period he agreed a new contract, but the offer was later withdrawn, and he was given permission to speak to other clubs. Unwilling to leave the Sussex area, he decided to stay with Crawley, but when the club halved the players' wages, thereby breaching their contracts and allowing them to leave on free transfers, Wormull chose to join Conference South club Lewes.|$|E
5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame as a player, managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). Clark Griffith is the only other Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise. In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> duties in October 2014, as he was replaced by Paul Molitor.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} study {{suggests}} that EI {{is not necessarily a}} universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{contributes}} to the ongoing discussion pertaining the concept <b>of</b> due <b>managerial</b> care and the business judgment rule in Czech law and aims to explore the aforementioned {{in the context of}} acquisition transactions, in the context of purchase of a business share or an enterprise (or a part of an enterprise) as the issue of acquisition transactions, despite its substantial practical impact, remain largely out of scientific focus. Specifically, the thesis explores the possibility of articulation of the standard <b>of</b> due <b>managerial</b> care for the purpose of acquisition transaction and, if such articulation is possible, its specific features. In its exploration, the thesis focuses on articulation of the above standard in the context of availability of information regarding the target company or enterprise, which commonly takes form of a due diligence. The author aims to define the above standard upon comparison of Czech concept <b>of</b> due <b>managerial</b> care and business judgment rule with its German counterparts. Thus, the thesis also addresses the issue to what extent it is permissible to transfer and subsequently use the findings from the German standard <b>of</b> due <b>managerial</b> care in the context of Czech law.

[...] After a few weeks of speculation, McCabe appointed former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Wilson as Adams' successor. [...] This appointment was met with outrage by sections of the Blades support due to Wilson's perceived lack <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> success and his links with the club's bitter cross-city rivals. Despite these protests, the club pressed ahead with the appointment and Wilson began to assemble his back room team, appointing former United defender Frank Barlow as his number two, fellow former Blade Billy Dearden as chief scout and Dave Morrison as fitness coach.|$|E

Still Feel Gone, with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade.

For example, one line is changed from [...] "morgue guys" [...] to [...] "chop shop guys". The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff. Kidd recalled: [...] "Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. People were feeling creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects." [...] Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline.

500|$|In 1962, Arsenal {{made the}} bold but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite his lack <b>of</b> <b>managerial</b> {{experience and the}} fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962–63. In his final season, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4,554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. [...] The only Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board {{in the summer of}} 1966, and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Though the club's directors did not know it at the time, Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.|$|E
