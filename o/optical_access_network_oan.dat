40|$|An {{increasing}} bandwidth {{demand has}} mandated {{a shift to}} the time and wavelength division multiplexing (TWDM) techniques in <b>optical</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> (<b>OAN).</b> Typical TWDM scheduling schemes consider scheduling of the optical line terminal receiver only. In this paper we have identified an additional collision domain that is present in TWDM schemes that offer security, in addition to bandwidth flexibility. Scheduling of the identified collision domain is termed as group scheduling. We illustrate that consideration of receiver scheduling only (as done in typical TWDM schemes) severely affects their throughput when implemented on flexible and secure TWDM architectures. A novel media access control protocol has been proposed in this paper that considers the multiple collision domains. Through simulations, {{we are able to}} illustrate that the proposed scheme achieves a high throughput. A theoretical upper bound of throughput has also been derived to explain the simulation results. Complexity reduction of the proposed scheme has been illustrated, thereby making it an attractive proposal...|$|R

Optical splitters are the key components in such <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> as for example GPON and XG-PON by ITU-T. In this paper we investigate the optical properties of 1 x 16 Y-branch splitter and 1 x 16 MMI splitters based on different widths of multimode interference section and different lengths of the output ports. These two splitters were designed, simulated and the obtained results of both were studied and compared with each other. Additionally, we show that the used standard waveguide core size (usually 6 x 6 µm 2 to match {{the diameter of the}} single mode input/output fibers, i. e. to keep the coupling loses as low as possible) supports not only propagation of the single mode but of the first mode too, leading to an asymmetric splitting ratio (increasing non-uniformity of split power over all the output waveguides). Decreasing waveguide core size, it is possible to suppress presence of the first mode and this way to reduce non-uniformity...|$|R
