40|$|A new {{formula is}} {{proposed}} for the end-bearing capacity of piles penetrating into crushable soils. The formula {{is based on a}} breakage mechanics model that accounts for the evolution of the grain size distribution (GSD) due to grain crushing with only physically meaningful parameters. The model is integrated using the finite-element method to study the penetration problem. Predictions of GSDs surrounding piles and pile end-bearing capacities are validated against experiments. Next, a parametric study is carried out to quantify the effects of grain crushing on the bearing capacity, and then to establish the formula. The predictive capability of the new formula is highlighted against predictions by previous formulae, which highlights its superior <b>origins.</b> <b>C.</b> Zhang, G. D. Nguyen and I. Eina...|$|R

50|$|Early tephra horizons were {{identified}} with the Saksunarvatn tephra (Icelandic origin, ca 10.2 cal. ka BP), forming a horizon in the late Pre-Boreal of Northern Europe, the Vedde ash (also Icelandic in <b>origin,</b> <b>c.</b> 12.0 cal. ka BP) and the Laacher See tephra (in the Eifel volcanic field, c. 12.9 cal. ka BP). Major volcanoes which {{have been used in}} tephrochronological studies include Vesuvius, Hekla and Santorini. Minor volcanic events may also leave their fingerprint in the geological record: Hayes Volcano is responsible for a series of six major tephra layers in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska. Tephra horizons provide a synchronous check against which to correlate the palaeoclimatic reconstructions that are obtained from terrestrial records, like fossil pollen studies (palynology), from varves in lake sediments or from marine deposits and ice-core records, and to extend the limits of carbon-14 dating.|$|E
50|$|This {{example is}} very easy for the reader to demonstrate. Consider a {{three-dimensional}} orthogonal Cartesian coordinate frame, for example, a level table top with a point marked on it for the origin, and the x and y axes laid out with pencil lines. Take a sphere of unit radius, for example, a ping-pong ball, and mark one point B in blue. Corresponding to this point is a diameter of the sphere, and the plane orthogonal to this diameter positioned at the center C of the sphere defines a great circle called the equator associated with point B. On this equator, select another point R and mark it in red. Position the sphere on the z = 0 plane such that the point B is coincident with the <b>origin,</b> <b>C</b> is located at x = 0, y = 0, z = 1, and R is located at x = 1, y = 0, and z = 1, i.e. R extends {{in the direction of}} the positive x axis. This is the initial or reference orientation of the sphere.|$|E

When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions, successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in Sri Lanka. All subsequent kings of the Jaffna Kingdom claimed descent from one Kulingai Cakravarti who is identified with Kalinga Magha by Swami Gnanaprakasar and Mudaliar Rasanayagam while maintaining their Pandyan progenitor’s family name. The origins of the Aryacakravarti are claimed in contemporary court chronicles but modern historians offer competing theories as well. The consensus held by historians is that they were a Pandyan feudatory family and the family is connected to the Ramanathapuram Hindu temple and was of Tamil Brahmin <b>origin.</b> <b>C.</b> Rasanayagam investigated why they called of themselves as Arya Chakravarthis; and states that when the Jaffna Kingdom fell {{into the hands of the}} Portuguese in 1618, the Jaffna kings claimed to have [...] "descended from two Brahmin kings who were appointed by Rama himself after his conquest of Lanka and establishment of the Rameshwavaram temple". The Jaffna kings also claimed that Lord Rama himself gave them the title of Arya and granted them the parasol and the emblem of Setu. Rasanayagam therefore suggested that the Brahmin connection may have been mythical and adopted by the later kings as they grew in eminence.|$|E

40|$|By {{analyzing}} the E 2 sequences of {{classical swine fever}} virus from field outbreaks in Taiwan during 1993 - 2001, three virus populations with distinct genotypes were determined including one historical (subgroup 3. 4) and two exotic (subgroup 2. 1) strains. The first subgroup 2. 1 virus was isolated in 1994 and further sporadic outbreaks occurred after 1996. Phylogenetic analysis using the E 2 region has segregated the Taiwanese strains of 2. 1 virus into two different genotypes (termed 2. 1 a and 2. 1 b). The 2. 1 b viruses were only isolated in 2001 and shared approximately 94. 8 % nucleotide identities to the 2. 1 a viruses in the total genomic sequences.
