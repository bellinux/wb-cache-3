His teammate Petter Solberg spoke of the challenges facing him: [...] " [...] everything gets a little bit more narrow and you always tend to be careful with how you turn in and keep the speed up in the corners, but <b>obviously</b> <b>you</b> have to listen to the pacenotes, that is absolutely crucial thing, 100%." [...] Loeb, who was familiar with driving on nighttime stages in the French Rally Championship, said, [...] "In the dark you have to drive like you can when you have only two passes on the recce, and then you also start with the fastest stage. I think there can be some big moments tonight." [...] Loeb and Elena took to the road first in their C4, and despite the limited visibility from both his ride position and the unlit roads, he set a pace time of [...] His teammate Dani Sordo and co-driver Marc Marti were able to keep up the pace, maxing out at [...] at one point along the route, and finished in [...] for second place.

Loeb was almost [...] ahead of his teammate, while Grönholm was [...] adrift; and Petter Solberg, over [...] behind the lead.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Jackson, {{producer}} of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that [...] "It is not our intention to offend people. But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, <b>obviously</b> <b>you</b> are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{key play}} {{occurred}} in the following Game 5 which changed {{the outcome of the}} series. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks' Hubert Davis attempted a 23-foot shot which was defended by Pippen, who was called for a personal foul by referee Hue Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87–86, and gave the Knicks a three games to two advantage in the series. the resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins' career by Referee magazine. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, [...] "I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I'm positive there was contact on the shot." [...] Darell Garretson, the league's supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, [...] "The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But {{it all comes down to}} what is sufficient contact. There's an old, old adage that refs don't make those calls in the last seconds. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>you</b> hope you don't make a call that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game." [...] Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a Chicago Tribune reporter, Garretson described Hollins' call as [...] "terrible". Chicago head coach Phil Jackson, upset over the outcome of the game, was fined $10,000 for comparing the loss to the gold medal game controversy at the 1972 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5000|$|OK, so <b>you</b> <b>obviously</b> {{prefer not}} to give much away in interviews. Why is that? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] I said, [...] "it {{is against}} the rules to tamper with a hazard. If you had got into a sand-bunker, would you smooth away the sand?

6000|$|... "Through a {{very simple}} process of reasoning, my good M. Ratichon," [...] he replied blandly. [...] "You are a very clever man, no doubt, but the cleverest of us is at times apt to make a mistake. You made two, and I profited by them. Firstly, after my sister and I left you this afternoon, you never made the {{slightest}} pretence of making inquiries or collecting information about the mysterious theft of the document. I {{kept an eye on}} you throughout the evening. You left your office and strolled for a while on the quays; you had an excellent dinner at the Restaurant des Anglais; then you settled down to your coffee and liqueur. Well, my good M. Ratichon, <b>obviously</b> <b>you</b> would have been more active in the matter if you had not known exactly where and when and how to lay your hands upon the document, for the recovery of which my sister had offered you ten thousand francs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} perceive," [...] our visitor would say as this became clear; [...] "your world {{is under the}} spell of an exaggerated idea, this preposterous idea there must be an {{individual}} Owner for everything in the world. <b>Obviously</b> <b>you</b> can't get on while you are {{under the spell of}} that! So long as you have this private ownership in everything, there's no help for you. You cut up your land and material in parcels of all sorts and sizes among this multitude of irresponsible little monarchs; you let all the material you need get distributed among another small swarm of Owners, and clearly you can only get them to work for public ends in the most roundabout, tedious and wasteful way. Why should they? They're very well satisfied as they are! But if {{the community as a whole}} insisted that this idea of private Ownership you have in regard to land and natural things was all nonsense--and it is all nonsense!--just think what you might not do with it now that you have all the new powers and lights that Science has given you. You might turn all your towns into garden cities, put an end to overcrowding, abolish smoky skies----" ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{hearing this}} album, {{influential}} Christian author Francis Schaeffer wrote the following to Taylor; [...] "The combination {{of music and}} lyrics really works on a very high level, and the message, therefore, comes across with real clarity... {{in the light of}} the gifts that the Lord has so <b>obviously</b> given <b>you,</b> and which <b>you</b> <b>obviously</b> developed with care and hard work, I do urge you with all my heart to press on. You are really doing something marvelously worthwhile. I must say the words really cut a wide swath in the need in the church today." ...|$|R

"Well," [...] {{went on the}} {{innocent}} and eminently respectable object of his suspicions, [...] "of course {{the absence of a}} date does not invalidate a will--it is matter for proof, that is all. But there, I am {{not in a position to}} give any opinion about the case; it is quite beyond me, and besides, that is not my business. But now, Miss Smithers, as you have once put yourself in the custody of the Registry in the capacity of a will, might I ask if you have any suggestion to make as to how you are to be dealt with. <b>Obviously</b> <b>you</b> cannot be locked up with the other wills, and equally obviously it is against the rules to allow a will to go out of the custody of the Court, unless by special permission of the Court. Also it is clear that I cannot put any restraint upon the liberty of the subject and order you to remain with me. Indeed, I doubt if it would be possible to do so by any means short of an Act of Parliament. Under these circumstances I am, I confess, a little confused as to what course should be taken with reference to this important alleged will." ...|$|E

That is the reason I [...] dreaded to go back and see you to-night. If you were seeking praise [...] of your own proper self, the sincerity of this compliment is [...] unquestionable. I ought to say, 'I hope my words to-night did not [...] disturb you,' but I will not, for I hope to see you speedily drop [...] all such hideous characters as The Baroness Telka. I felt as an [...] artist might upon seeing a glorious statue befouled with mire. I [...] say this not because I wish you to do Lillian. In the light of [...] last night's performance my own play is a gray autumn day with a [...] touch of frost in the air. It is inconceivable that you should be [...] vitally interested in it. I fear no play that I care to write will [...] please a sufficient number of people to make its production worth [...] your while. I release you from your promise.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Murder Dog, Bruce said that the song is not directed toward all Southerners. He stated that [...] "if you’re a redneck and you're not a racist, then <b>obviously</b> <b>you</b> know that I'm not talkin’ about you.

50|$|On {{a typical}} {{newspaper}} page, {{there is a}} margin on all four sides, say 1 inch all around. <b>Obviously</b> <b>you</b> don't want print running right {{against the edge of}} the paper, but you also don't want print to run into the fold or where the publication might be stapled. However, when the two pages meet in the middle like 8 and 9 in our example, this isn't a concern because both pages appear right next to each other and lie relatively flat.|$|E

5000|$|After his debut, Rankin {{returned}} to the club's NYC team, where he would stay {{for the remainder of}} the 2008 season. Rankin later said, [...] "I'm not going to say I wasn't thrown in too young but it was an opportunity I took ... that I was given... it is one of those things I have to live with now. Sixteen is <b>obviously,</b> when <b>you</b> look at it now, a bit young." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, Houllier {{was again}} full of praise for him. He said [...] "Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Pedro. You can watch {{and wonder if}} they are playing in the youth team sometimes. They have fast {{technique}} and young Barry has all of that." [...] Houllier then defended Bannan's size, and insisted it won't hold him back. Houllier said [...] "The Premier League has got more physical {{but it is not}} about a matter of size. <b>Obviously</b> <b>you</b> need size in some positions but it's also a matter of commitment and physical commitment.

I'm looking forward to it, <b>obviously.</b> <b>You</b> love to get that qualifying spot on Sunday, but we really earned it tonight, to start on the front row, which is even better. It was definitely a great way to start the season." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 1986 {{fan club}} interview, guitarist Dave Hill {{spoke of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "The song was written about being abroad wasn't it?

5000|$|... "Don't Miss You" [...] is {{a breakup}} anthem that Coulter says expresses her {{feelings}} about her ex-husband, Jamie Babbington. It {{is the first}} song Coulter wrote in New York City. She explained, [...] "Well you’ve got to put yourself in my position where I was in a relationship for seven years, the only relationship I’d ever known and <b>obviously</b> <b>you</b> don’t write a song with lyrics like that if everything was happy as.

5000|$|The IMF (International Monetary Fund) {{and what}} they did to {{countries}} in the Global South—which is, of course, exactly the same thing bankers are starting to do at home now—is just a modern version of this old story.

Therefore, {{people are going to have}} to stop eating so much. The money has to be extracted from the most vulnerable members of society. Lives are destroyed; millions of people die.
