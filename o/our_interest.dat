5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Burgess, in Ninety-nine Novels, cited {{it as one}} of the 99 best {{novels in}} English since 1939. [...] "Fleming raised the {{standard}} of the popular story of espionage through good writing — a heightened journalistic style — {{and the creation of a}} government agent — James Bond, 007 — who is sufficiently complicated to compel <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> over a whole series of adventures. A patriotic lecher with a tinge of Scottish puritanism in him, a gourmand and amateur of vodka martinis, a smoker of strong tobacco who does not lose his wind, he is pitted against impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs. Auric Goldfinger is the most extravagant of these. All this is, in some measure, a great joke, but Fleming's passion for plausibility, his own naval intelligence background, and a kind of sincere Manicheism, allied to journalistic efficiency in the management of his recit, make his work rather impressive. The James Bond films, after From Russia With Love, stress the fantastic and are inferior entertainment to the books. It is unwise to disparage the well-made popular. There was a time when Conan Doyle was ignored by the literary annalists even though Sherlock Holmes was evidently one of the great characters of fiction. We must beware of snobbishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{regard the}} 1991 {{animated}} film as {{superior to the}} 2017 live-action remake. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 1991 film [...] "worked wonderfully because it was pure Broadway, written for the screen, blending comedy and romance and magic and just enough snark in the margins", while the 2017 remake got lost in translation since [...] "The movie takes our knowledge and <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> in the material for granted. It zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen, charmlessly." [...] Phillips also wrote of the 2017 film that [...] "too often we're watching highly qualified performers, plus a few less conspicuously talented ones (Watson, primarily), stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality". Dana Schwartz of the Observer criticized some of the 2017 film changes to the characters like Gaston and the Beast as regressive by watering down their distinguishing personalities from the 1991 film, also arguing that the added backstory to {{the characters in the}} 2017 version failed to [...] "advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way". David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film [...] "feels particularly egregious, in part, because it’s so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), it’s hard not to notice".|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Quantico {{received}} positive reviews, with most critics praising Chopra's performance.

According to the website consensus, [...] "Obvious copycatting aside, Quantico provides ludicrously entertaining thrills from a well-balanced cast." [...] The series has a score of 70 out of 100 (based on 25 reviews) on Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Newark Star-Ledgers Vicki Hyman called Quantico the best new show {{of the season and}} graded it an [...] "A". Hyman wrote that the show was [...] "taut and terrifically calibrated ... with at least one deadly effective twist you won't see coming." [...] Wiegand, David from San Francisco Chronicle also praised the series: [...] "The plot is intricate and compelling, the characters magnetic and mysterious at the same time." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today rated Quantico three out of four, calling its cast [...] "an appropriately diverse group, brought to life by generally fine performances, led by Chopra's and Ellis": [...] "There are times when Quantico feels a shade mechanical, in moments when you can practically hear the plot gears moving. But it accomplishes what the opener of a whodunit needs to do: establish a wide range of plausible suspects and spark <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> in the mystery and the hero." ...|$|E

On 26 September 1947, the reviewer from The Hindu [...] believed {{the technical aspects}} had made Miss Malini [...] "Gemini's most outstanding achievement", concluding that the film was [...] "of immense significance for the Indian screen." [...] The Free Press Journals review the same day similarly opined, [...] " [...] Malini with its technical perfection, good photography and high level acting splashed by good music, and untainted by vulgarity will provide good entertainment." [...] The following day, a review of Miss Malini from The Indian Express noted that it presented [...] "a sort of skit on modern life" [...] and termed it as a [...] "fine entertainment." [...] The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran review {{described it as a}} [...] "sample of the high production values Gemini is capable of introducing in a picture". The critic from the Telugu newspaper Andhra Prabha said on 28 September, [...] "Evidence of skillful expression of art is profusely manifest in this picture." [...] On 3 October, the critic from The Mail praised the cast performances, the film's music, [...] "enchanting pageantry" [...] and Subbu's direction. A reviewer from another Tamil newspaper, Dinamani, believed the film to be [...] "a pointer to social pictures in future." [...] The critic from The Indian Review called Miss Malini an [...] "attempt at a new kind of filmmaking with new technique.

[...] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was [...] "somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." [...] Variety's 'Robe' believed the film was a [...] "ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Sarris called it [...] "one of the grimmest films I have ever seen in my life...2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points." [...] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing of the film, and declared, [...] "2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.") John Simon felt it was [...] "a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film is fascinating when it concentrates on apes or machines... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans...2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story." [...] Eminent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film [...] "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long... a film out of control". The BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.|$|E
500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

The San Francisco Chronicle praised the series, calling it a winner and wrote: [...] "The plot is intricate and compelling, the characters magnetic and mysterious at the same time." [...] James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote about Chopra's performance, describing her as the [...] "strongest human asset" [...] of the show, and added that [...] "she is immediately charismatic and commanding". He added that [...] "the narrative gymnastics make the first half-hour of Quantico pass quickly and entertainingly. Too much of this, though, keeps you from investing much in the characters." [...] Robert Bianco from USA Today gave it a three out of four, praising the diversity of the cast and Chopra's and Ellis performances, writing [...] "There are times when Quantico feels a shade mechanical, in moments when you can practically hear the plot gears moving. But it accomplishes what the opener of a whodunit needs to do: establish a wide range of plausible suspects and spark <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> in the mystery and the hero." [...] In contrast, TheWraps Tim Grierson, who although felt that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", was less impressed, writing that the show often succumbed to [...] "lame-brained plotting" [...] and a unconvincing portrayal of the setting.

500|$|The episode premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. Although initially cringing {{over the}} musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode [...] "admittedly fun" [...] because it [...] "gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself". In {{a review of}} the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the [...] "worst overall episode" [...] of the season however, asking the question [...] "Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought {{this would be a good}} idea?" [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave [...] "Fringe a lot of credit for pulling off this hour so cleverly" [...] Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was [...] "bizarre" [...] to watch; it [...] "held <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension". MTVs John Wigler loved the [...] "noir" [...] element, and thought [...] "each and every participating [...] "Fringe" [...] cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought [...] "it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E
