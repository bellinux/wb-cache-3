5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E

40|$|Background Medication errors (MEs) are {{the most}} common types of medical errors which effecting on {{pediatric}} safety. For decrease MEs, we should to have information about difference aspects <b>of</b> <b>MEs.</b> We have no study which assessed the frequency, types and causes <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> made by pediatric nurses, in Iran. Material and Methods This was a cross-sectional study, which performed on 53 Pediatric Nurses. Data were collected by a self-structured questionnaire for assessment <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> contained 3 parts: 1 - one question about the fact that, do you had MEs in past 3 months; 2 - types <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> occurred (12 items); 3 - causes <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> from nurses’ perspective (20 items). The MEs in past 3 months gathered through pediatric nurses’ self-report. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used for analysis. Data were analyzed using the SPSS. Results The majority of participants were female (77. 3 %), and initial (novice) nurses (33. 9 %). The results showed that, 31 (58. 4 %) of nurses were reported at least one MEs history and totally, 131 MEs were occurred in past 3 months. Most prevalent <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> types were reported: wrong dose (36. 6 %) and wrong drug preparation (14. 5 %). Also, most prevalent <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> causes from Nurses’ perspective were reported: poor medication knowledge (96. 2 %) and poor calculation skills (73. 5 %). Conclusion With using of this study results, we can program for prevention/decrease MEs and enhancing pediatric safety. On the basis of this study, actually we should enhancing level of nurses knowledge by education and to carry out special courses for pediatric nurses...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the Drosophila mesoderm is initiated by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor twist. We identified a gene encoding a putative transcription factor, mes 2, in a screen for essential mesoderm-expressed genes that function downstream <b>of</b> twist. <b>Mes</b> 2 protein belongs to a family of 48 Drosophila proteins containing MADF domains. MADF domains exist in worms, flies, and fish. Mes 2 is a nuclear protein first produced in trunk and head mesoderm during late gastrulation. At later embryonic stages, mes 2 is expressed in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in tissues derived from the head mesoderm. We have identified a null mutation <b>of</b> <b>mes</b> 2 that leads to developmental arrest in first instar larvae. Increased production <b>of</b> <b>Mes</b> 2 in multiple embryonic and larval tissues almost always causes lethality. The ubiquitous or epidermal misexpression <b>of</b> <b>mes</b> 2 in the embryo causes a dramatic loss of epidermal integrity resulting in the failure of dorsal closure. Our data show that the precise regulation <b>of</b> <b>mes</b> 2 expression is critical for normal development in Drosophila and implicate Mes 2 in the regulation o...|$|R

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> and Juliet can {{be traced}} to the early days of the {{relationship}} between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the backstage world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the cultural tolerance in The King and I.|$|E
