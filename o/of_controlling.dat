In the study, Personal Information Form and Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale prepared by researchers were used. Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale includes two sub-dimensions; internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Independent samples t test was used to show differences between variables and sub-dimensions. According to findings, there is a significant difference between scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> females and scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> males. Whereas the average score of external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is lower than male’, point average of internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is high.

We examined the self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were contributors for internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition of attention, external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and education contributed to self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> However, the overall predicted variance accounted for by these predictors was small; thus, further research is necessary to examine imperative variables related with self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was investigated. The hypothesis {{was that an}} internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> {{would be associated with}} less impairment in functioning than other dimensions of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Prior research undertaken into CFS has been inconsistent in its finding's and it continues to be an area of controversial interpretations. A repeated measures design was used, 74 people participated at the initial stage of the study and 67 people participated in the second stage. The Functional Limitations Profile was used to assess levels of impairment. The Multidimensional Health Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> was used to identify types of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> orientation, and the Shapiro Control Inventory was used to establish a clearer picture <b>of</b> <b>control</b> issues. Correlations and t-tests were used to investigate the {{relationship between}} health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning. The results of these analyses indicated that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was positively related to functioning. Multiple regression analysis was performed and showed that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> could successfully predict functioning measured at the second stage of the study. An unexpected discovery was that a doctor's health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> impacted negatively on functioning. The Shapiro Control Inventory revealed that the CFS sample fell within the normal range in the majority <b>of</b> <b>control</b> areas, but was outside the normal range in only six <b>of</b> the 23 <b>control</b> areas.

5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, {{herbivory}} or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability.
