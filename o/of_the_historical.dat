The Caesars (1968) was an earlier television series which featured Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> coastal Asian {{groups were}} driven to near-extinction {{in short order}} by Japanese {{industrial}} hunts. Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s, and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.|$|E

5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990.

Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical,</b> nationally developed schools of harmony and melody {{in favor of}} experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E

To record the voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue.

5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
