2500|$|The {{next level}} of despair is [...] "The despair that is {{conscious}} of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self {{in which there is}} something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." [...] This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will <b>or</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God {{or at the very least}} see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading [...] "Despair over the earthly." ...|$|E
