This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title Opération Lune.

Stanley Ralph Ross, Stanford Sherman, and Charles Hoffman were script writers who generally leaned more toward campy comedy, and in Ross's case, sometimes outright slapstick and satire. It was originally intended as a one-hour show, but ABC pushed up the premiere date from fall 1966 to January of that year. With the network having only two early-evening half-hour time slots available, the show was split into two parts, to air twice a week in 30-minute installments.

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked {{a turning point}} in his career. The {{screenplay}} originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him {{in front of the class}} and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the [...] "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it [...] "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought [...] "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" [...] to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as [...] "dreamlike": [...] "It was like one of those scenes in an <b>old</b> <b>movie</b> when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" [...] He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.|$|E

For example, Gerardo Almendres, a Filipino {{high school student}} had sent away for an International Correspondence Schools course on radios shortly before the war started. Fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though Almendres had never handled one. Almendres was assisted by a Filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another Filipino who once had listened to a radio.

Key episodes include [...] "Thou Shalt Not Steele," [...] which introduced Laura's mother and Felicia, a woman from Steele's past; [...] "Sting of Steele," [...] which introduced Daniel Chalmers (Efrem Zimbalist Jr., the real-life father of Stephanie) as Steele's former mentor; and [...] "Vintage Steele," [...] a fan favorite which focused on Laura's past. Additionally, writer Joel Steiger won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his script for the first-season episode [...] "In The Steele of the Night."
