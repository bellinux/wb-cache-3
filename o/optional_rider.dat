50|$|HDFC Life's {{products}} include Protection, Pension, Savings, Investment, Health {{along with}} Children and Women plans. The company also provides an option of customizing the plans, by adding optional benefits called riders, at an additional price. The company currently has 29 retail and 8 group products, along with 7 <b>optional</b> <b>rider</b> benefits (as on 31 May 2016).|$|E
50|$|Many {{juvenile}} {{life insurance}} policies {{can be written}} {{without the need for}} a medical exam. In the case of larger policies, a doctor or insurance agent may have to confirm the age, sex, height, weight, and apparent healthiness of the child. There are <b>optional</b> <b>riders</b> to the basic policy that can add up to $2,000,000 of guaranteed coverage.|$|R
5000|$|Rates: BOE {{insurance}} rates {{are based on}} the insured's age (at time of purchase), occupational duties, health status, <b>optional</b> <b>riders</b> selected, benefit period, and elimination period. Once a BOE policy is owned, coverage can not be increased without providing evidence of medical insurability, unless a future increase option or similar rider is purchased at time of policy issue.|$|R
40|$|The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWBs) are <b>optional</b> <b>riders</b> {{provided}} {{by insurance companies}} in variable annuities. They guarantee the policyholders' ability to get the initial investment back by making periodic withdrawals regardless {{of the impact of}} poor market performance. With GMWBs attached, variable annuities become more attractive. This type of guarantee can be challenging to price and hedge. We employ two approaches to price GMWBs. Under the constant static withdrawal assumption, the first approach is to decompose the GMWB and the variable annuity into an arithmetic average strike Asian call option and an annuity certain. The second approach is to treat the GMWB alone as a put option whose maturity and payoff are random. Hedging helps insurers specify and manage the risks of writing GMWBs, as well as find their fair prices. We propose semi-static hedging strategies that offer several advantages over dynamic hedging. The idea is to construct a portfolio of European options that replicate the conditional expected GMWB liability in a short time period, and update the portfolio after the options expire. This strategy requires fewer portfolio adjustments, and outperforms the dynamic strategy when there are random jumps in the underlying price. We also extend the semi-static hedging strategies to the Heston stochastic volatility model...|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} of Japan created the [...] "Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance" [...] scheme in 1966, and the scheme has been revised several times since. [...] Homeowners may buy earthquake insurance from {{an insurance company}} as an <b>optional</b> <b>rider</b> to a fire insurance policy. [...] Insurers enrolled in the JER scheme who have to pay earthquake claims to homeowners share the risk among themselves and also the government, through the JER. The government pays a much larger proportion of the claims if a single earthquake causes aggregate damage of over about 1 trillion yen (about US $8.75 billion). The maximum payout {{in a single year}} to all JER insurance claim filers is 5.5 trillion yen (about US $39.4 billion); if claims exceed this amount, then the claims are pro-rated among all claimants.|$|E
50|$|Heading southward, {{the route}} {{passes through the}} busy city of Wilmington, North Carolina, and takes another ferry ride into Southport, North Carolina. Next come farmlands, swamps and the Francis Marion National Forest. There is an {{optional}} 34 mi spur into historic Charleston, South Carolina. There are more farms and swamps in Georgia. Another <b>optional</b> spur takes <b>riders</b> into Savannah, Georgia, {{with one of the}} largest national historic landmark districts in the United States. Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is four miles off route. It {{is one of the largest}} and most primitive swamps remaining in the United States. Riders can see numerous alligators of all sizes, stroll on boardwalks over the marshes, or take a boat ride through the swamp.|$|R
5000|$|For much of Pern's history, all green riders were male. During these periods, all green mating flights {{resulted}} in homosexual intercourse between the riders of the dragons involved. This homosexual intercourse is {{accepted in the}} Weyr as being separate from the rider's sexual orientation unless the rider has shown otherwise. Mating flight sex between two riders, {{one of whom is}} not the other's chosen partner (known as a weyrmate) is not considered to be [...] "cheating". It is understood within the Weyr that sex during mating flights is not <b>optional</b> for the <b>rider.</b> Anne McCaffrey stated that [...] "The dragon decides, the rider complies." [...] Dragons do not usually consider the orientation of their riders when considering what female they wish to chase, or, for a female dragon, what male dragon might catch her. A primary example of this behavior is between Weyrleader T'gellan, Weyrwoman Talina, and green rider Mirrim. T'gellan and Mirrim are weyrmates, but T'gellan's bronze dragon must mate with Weyrwoman Talina's gold dragon at least yearly in order for T'gellan to maintain his position as Weyrleader. Mirrim, known to be an extremely acerbic and temperamental rider, shows no jealousy or other problem with her weyrmate's regular sexual contact with Talina.|$|R
40|$|Mountain biking is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in urban areas, including in forest remnants in Australia cities. To increase the technical challenge for riders, trail technical features such as jumps, bridges, mounds and ditches, along with informal trails are often constructed without authorisation. We assessed the social, environmental and management challenges associated {{with the presence of}} such features, developed a method for assessing them, and then used this method to examine them in an endangered forest within the Gold Coast in Australia. In a 29 ha remnant of Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) forest there were 116 unauthorised features, mostly jumps, ditches and mounds, which collectively resulted in an area of 1601 m 2 of bare soil and 4010 m 2 of undergrowth cleared. Features differed in their size, construction materials used, and their impacts on the environment. Although nearly two thirds had low to moderate safety, most were in moderate to good condition, had fall zones and <b>optional</b> routes for <b>riders.</b> Management options for land managers, in this case a publicly funded University, include (1) feature removal and site rehabilitation, (2) conversion to official features, (3) removal and provision of an alternative location for official features, or (4) maintain the status quo. There are social, financial and environmental benefits and limitations to each of these options highlighting that unauthorised trail technical features are a challenge for planners and managers that often have no easy solution.
