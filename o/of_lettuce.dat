5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation <b>of</b> <b>lettuce</b> seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F.

5|$|The {{domestication}} <b>of</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{over the}} centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification <b>of</b> <b>lettuce</b> is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns.

5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer different types <b>of</b> <b>lettuce,</b> with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated {{until the early}} 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) {{favored the}} accumulation of secondary metabolites in leaves <b>of</b> <b>lettuces</b> in previous studies. When fertilized with selenium (Se), mycorrhizal lettuces had more proteins, sugars and minerals than non-mycorrhizal ones. However, Se contents were lower in mycorrhizal plants suggesting a negative correlation between Se and AMF applications. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test if Se fertilization interfered with AMF technology for enhancing secondary metabolites in lettuces. Green and red-leaf lettuces were or not inoculated with AMF and received or not different selenocompounds. Flavonols and anthocyanins were non-destructively measured. At harvest, growth, water status, chlorophylls, carotenoids, phenolics and antioxidant capacity were determined. In green-leaf lettuces Se application counteracted benefits of AMF on chlorophylls and carotenoids and decreased phenolics. In red-leaf lettuces, sodium selenite positively interacted with AMF in enhancing flavonols, but imidoselenocarbamate reduced flavonols in mycorrhizal plants. No significant interaction between AMF and Se was detected for the total antioxidant capacity in leaves of both types <b>of</b> <b>lettuces.</b> The efficiency <b>of</b> mycorrhizal technology for improving antioxidant compounds in the edible tissues <b>of</b> <b>lettuces</b> can be modified under Se fertilization, being the interaction positive or negative depending on lettuce cultivar, antioxidant compound and chemical form of selenocompound.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{features of}} commercial head quality formation in varieties <b>of</b> cutting <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa var. capitata L.) for different growing methods. To study {{the influence of}} growing methods for cutting lettuce plants on the weight of commercial heads, indices of yield and quality of freshly harvested products. Methods. Field study, laboratory testing and statistical evaluation. Results. The results of studying peculiarities of head formation in such cutting lettuce varieties as ‘Godar’ (control), ‘Smuhlianka’, ‘Olzhych’ and ‘Dyvohrai’ were shown. Based {{on the results of}} phenological observations, the duration of interstage periods of growth and development <b>of</b> cutting <b>lettuce</b> plants was determined for the different growing methods. The model <b>of</b> cutting <b>lettuce</b> <b>of</b> capitata variety for different growing methods was presented in terms of biochemical parameters (content of dry matter, vitamin C, nitrates, amount of sugars). The influence of growing methods for cutting lettuce plants on the commercial head weight, indices of yield and quality of freshly harvested products was studied. Obtained results confirmed that in early ripening varie­ti­es the heads were smaller (150 g) and not dense, in late ripening varieties they were large and dense, weight was 150 – 500 g. Freshly harvested commercial products <b>of</b> head <b>lettuce</b> in case <b>of</b> seedling cultivation was characterized by a slight increase in dry matter content by 0. 15 – 0. 29 %. The corresponding pattern was observed for the total sugar content. Its amount was slightly higher: 1. 3 – 1. 9 % in case of direct sowing and 1. 6 – 1. 9 % – for seedlings cultivation. The content of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, mg/ 100 g) was the highest in the ‘Dyvohrai’ variety despite of the method of growing. The largest quantity <b>of</b> nitrates in <b>lettuce</b> heads was in the inner stem (480 mg/kg), while {{in the middle of the}} head it was reduced to 110 mg/kg. Conclusions. Freshly harvested heads <b>of</b> cutting <b>lettuce</b> were analyzed for the content of such basic biochemical indices as dry matter, vitamin C, protein, nitrates, amount of sugars.

The price of iceberg lettuce tripled overnight, and thousands of acres <b>of</b> <b>lettuce</b> were plowed under as crops spoiled on the ground.
