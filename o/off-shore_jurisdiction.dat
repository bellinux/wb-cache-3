40|$|Trusts {{and their}} civil law equivalents, often known as {{foundations}} or associations, play {{a large and}} increasing role in the global economy, holding trillions {{of dollars worth of}} assets and generating billions of dollars worth of revenue and trustees’ fees annually. Once considered nothing more than “mere” estate planning devices, trusts are now more often seen in commercial rather than in private contexts, and often feature sophisticated financial institutions as professional trustees. With favorable tax laws in various <b>off-shore</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> making international trusts increasingly popular and hostile trust litigation reaching epidemic proportions, arbitration would seem to be many parties’ dispute resolution mechanism of choice. To some extent, this is very much the case, with arbitration often being used to resolve conflicts between trusts and external third parties. However, arbitration of internal trust disputes – by far the more common type of concern in this area of law – is much more controversial and {{has been the subject of}} extensive and vigorous debate in the trust industry. Although trust experts have written extensively on mandatory trust arbitration, the arbitration community has been strangely silent in these discussions, and this article is among the first to consider the unique challenges facing future arbitration of internal trust disputes from the arbitral perspective. In so doing, this article provides new insights on the types of procedures that are necessary to ensure procedural fairness in what is often a complex, multiparty proceeding. This article also considers what steps settlors can take to improve the enforceability of an arbitration provision located in the trust itself and analyzes the only set of institutional rules targeted specifically toward trust disputes – the AAA Trust Arbitration Rules – by comparing the AAA approach to the newly identified best practices in this field and to certain related initiatives from the ICC and the DIS...|$|R
40|$|Among {{financial}} investors, investment {{funds are}} the ones that mostly have increased their importance in capital markets where the regulation on investment funds is still incipient. By using investment funds, individual investors can have the possibility to participate in various companies as well as in market places worldwide without the need of specific and elaborated knowledge of the same companies and markets. After an introductory chapter I start analyzing the definition and activity of an investment fund, attention is also paid to the UCITS regulation for European investment funds. In the next chapter I analyze how investment funds are taxed in specific EU Member Countries (i. e. Italy and Luxembourg), in the United States and also how investment funds are treated in <b>off-shore</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> The core chapter of the paper discusses the possible application of tax treaties to investment funds, in particular {{from the perspective of the}} state of source. The definition of beneficial owner and the treatment of income distributed from an investment fund are also analyzed in depth. The same chapter also focuses on the possible application of the OECD Partnership Report to investment funds. Based on my findings the last chapter is dedicated to some final considerations about the application of tax treaties to investment funds. I have always been fascinated by capital markets, their techniques and the tax treatment of income arising from investments in capital markets. I think that this paper represents a great possibility of acquiring special knowledge in a topic that I always liked. Moreover, another reason that encouraged me to choose this topic is the fact that still not many scholars have written about such a hot topic, convincing me to contribute to the discussion thereof. My objective is to analyze the possible application of tax treaties to investment funds in order to provide some suggestions as a valid starting point for a future deeper analysis...|$|R
