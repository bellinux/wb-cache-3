25|$|Only minor grille and {{taillight}} lens revisions {{highlighted the}} 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was {{dropped from the}} option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner, and surprisingly similar to today's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine RPM's, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered {{for the last time}} this year.|$|E
2500|$|Including a 24.5% lower first-gear, a 20.2% lower reverse gear, and a 3.3% higher top (<b>overdrive)</b> <b>gear</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Drive train {{options for}} the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an {{optional}} 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b> The top gear in the 5-speed was its <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> whereas the automatic transmission featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> that would engage at speeds over [...] The drive train for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar.|$|E
50|$|A new four-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 {{transmission}} with <b>overdrive</b> <b>gearing</b> {{became available}} in 1981 for the 1982 model year. The 151 hp 379 cuin L Detroit Diesel V-8 {{was added to}} replace the LF9 Oldsmobile diesel. Chrome front bumpers were now standard on base models.|$|R
50|$|A three speed gearbox {{was fitted}} as standard; three forward and one reverse. Several ways of {{improving}} the performance through modifications to the gearbox and transmission train were applied; replacement close ratio gears fitted to gearbox, <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears</b> fitted behind the original gearbox and higher ratio crown & pinion gears fitted to the differential unit on the back axle.|$|R
50|$|In 1st gear, {{the engine}} makes 2.97 {{revolutions}} for every {{revolution of the}} transmission’s output. In 4th gear, the gear ratio of 1:1 means that the engine and the transmission's output rotate at the same speed. 5th and 6th gears are known as <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears,</b> in which {{the output of the}} transmission is revolving faster than the engine's output.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, a {{redesigned}} {{front-wheel drive}} Electra debuted {{with the new}} C body which was further downsized compared to the previous generation. [...] Despite its notably smaller exterior, interior dimensions remained largely {{the same as the}} prior generation. [...] As part of the model redesign, Buick also discarded all V8 engines. Sales began in April 1984, alongside the previous rear-wheel-drive model, which had ceased production that month. It was initially powered by a carbureted 3.0 liter Buick V6 engine, a fuel injected 3.8 liter Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 liter Oldsmobile diesel V6 engine. [...] Each was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission with a 0.70:1 <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b> [...] The 3.0 liter V6 and 4.3 liter diesel V6 were no longer offered after 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Including a 24.5% lower first-gear, a 20.2% lower reverse gear, and a 3.3% higher top (<b>overdrive)</b> <b>gear</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Compared to the AW's 25% {{reduction}} in first gear, direct-drive second <b>gear,</b> and 33.33% <b>overdrive</b> 3rd <b>gear,</b> the SW offered slightly wider gearing, {{referred to by}} Brian Hayes as [...] "super-wide" [...] gearing, with 27.7% reduction for first gear, direct-drive second, and taller 38.4% <b>overdrive</b> third <b>gear.</b> Riders appreciate the nearly silent operation of its springless centrifugal pawls.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Stream was {{launched}} in November 2007, powered by a 1.8 L engine producing [...] at 6300 rpm and 174 Nm of torque at 4300 rpm and is mated to a 5-speed automatic gearbox, with fourth and fifth being <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears</b> for better highway fuel economy. In February 2009, Honda launched the RSZ variant joining the normal Stream.|$|R
50|$|A two plate dry disk {{diaphragm}} spring clutch drove Fuller four-speed main and three-speed auxiliary transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears.</b> The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R
50|$|Drive train {{options for}} the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an {{optional}} 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b> The top gear in the 5-speed was its <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> whereas the automatic transmission featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> that would engage at speeds over 35 mi/h km/h. The drive train for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar.|$|E
50|$|The 5-speed manual {{transmission}} was direct in 4th gear {{and had an}} <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b> A 2-speed transfer case also engaged or disengaged the front axle.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the 700R4, most 200-4Rs have a multicase {{bellhousing}} for {{use with}} Chevrolet, Buick/Olds/Pontiac (BOP), and Cadillac engines. However, 200-4Rs share mounting locations with the TH-400. Since the external dimensions {{are similar to the}} TH-350 (overall length, drive shaft yoke spline count/diameter and general size), 200-4Rs are often swapped in place of TH-350s in older vehicles to provide an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b> Early models had PRND321 on the cluster, while later models had PRN(D)D21, with the left D identified as the <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> by a square or oval ring.|$|E
50|$|Ford's new 6-speed 6R75 {{intelligent}} {{automatic transmission}} with dual <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears</b> was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic {{transmission control module}} (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss {{in case of a}} power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner's driving style.|$|R
50|$|When using <b>overdrive</b> <b>gearing,</b> the car's {{engine speed}} drops, {{reducing}} wear and normally saving fuel. Since 1981 U.S. corporate {{average fuel economy}} (CAFE) legislation, virtually all domestic vehicles have included overdrive to save fuel. One should refer to the car's owner's manual for the proper speed to run at overdrive. All engines have a range of peak efficiency and it is possible for the use of overdrive to keep the engine out of this range for {{all or part of the}} time of its use if used at inappropriate speeds, thus cutting into any fuel savings from the lower engine speed.|$|R

50|$|Albion {{also made}} the Claymore with the 4 speed gearbox,The Reiver was a six wheeler.The Chieftain had a 6 speed gearbox,6th being an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> with a worm and wheel rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The TREMEC TR-4050 is a 5-speed manual {{transmission}} for longitudinal engine {{rear wheel drive}} trucks. It includes one <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> and a light-weight aluminum housing. It is manufactured by Transmission Technologies Corporation.|$|E
50|$|A common {{complaint}} {{about the first}} generation models is that the light-duty A4LD automatic transmission, which was basically the 3-speed Ford C3 transmission with an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> was not well-suited for towing {{and was unable to}} cope with higher power output from modified engines. The A4LD was also known to suffer premature failure of the <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> (or 4th gear) when used to frequently tow or haul heavy loads. Improved fluid cooling using aftermarket transmission coolers can alleviate these issues. Also, the automatic locking front hubs on four-wheel drive vehicles tended to fail prematurely; the manual versions, made for Ford by Warn, suffered from fewer reliability problems.|$|E
25|$|A 5-speed manual {{transmission}} {{with a very}} low 1st and an <b>overdrive</b> 5th <b>gear</b> was used. A transfer case had a high and low range, a neutral for power take-off operation, and engaged the front axle. Axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type.|$|R
50|$|The A518, later renamed 46RH (hydraulic {{controlled}} governor pressure) and 46RE (electronic controlled governor pressure), is an A727 derivative with overdrive, in the A500 ilk. Starting in 1990, it {{was used}} in some trucks and vans. The <b>overdrive</b> fourth <b>gear</b> ratio is 0.69:1.|$|R
5000|$|Manumatic {{refers to}} an {{automatic}} transmission that allows convenient driver control of gear selection. For most of automotive history, automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or column shifter, usually to limit the transmission shifting beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears</b> when towing. Manumatics enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a [...] "manual mode" [...] and select any available gear, usually in a sequential [...] "upshift/downshift" [...] manner. Different car manufacturers {{use a variety of}} labels for their manumatic transmissions, such as ''''Tiptronic'''', 'Geartronic', ''''Touchshift'''', 'Sportronic', 'clutchless-manual' and others.|$|R
50|$|The TREMEC TR-3450 is a 5-speed manual {{transmission}} for longitudinal engine {{rear wheel drive}} trucks. It includes one <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> a light-weight aluminum housing, multi-cone synchronizers on first and second gear, and a synchromesh reverse gear. It is manufactured by Transmission Technologies Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> that would engage at speeds over 35 mi/h km/h. The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|Overdrive ('D', 'OD', or a boxed D or {{the absence}} of an {{illuminated}} 'O/D OFF'): This mode is used in some transmissions to allow early computer-controlled transmissions to engage the automatic overdrive. In these transmissions, Drive (D) locks the automatic overdrive off, but is identical otherwise. OD (Overdrive) in these cars is engaged under steady speeds or low acceleration at approximately 35 - 45 mph. Under hard acceleration or below 35 - 45 mph, the transmission will automatically downshift. Other vehicles with this selector (for example light trucks) will not only disable up-shift to the <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> but keep the remaining gears available for use of engine braking. Drivers should verify the behaviour of this switch and consider the benefits of reduced friction brake use when city driving where speeds typically do not necessitate the <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} was a Warner T93 5-speed with {{a direct}} 4th <b>gear</b> and <b>overdrive</b> 5th <b>gear.</b> The transfer case had {{high and low}} gears, and engaged the front axle. Originally all axles were a Timken split type, later trucks also used GM [...] "banjo" [...] types.|$|R
50|$|The ratio {{shift was}} {{accomplished}} by taking the W55 base ratios and changing the input shaft to intermediate shaft ratio by 7.9%, thus shifting 1, 2, 3 ratios higher by that amount. This also shifted the <b>overdrive</b> 5th <b>gear</b> higher by the same amount creating a wider and taller overdrive ratio.|$|R
50|$|As popular cars became faster {{relative}} to legal limits and fuel costs became more important, particularly after the 1973 oil crisis, {{the use of}} 5-speed gearboxes became more common in mass-market cars. These had a direct (1:1) fourth <b>gear</b> with an <b>overdrive</b> 5th <b>gear,</b> replacing {{the need for the}} separate overdrive gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The C3 was {{modified}} into the A4LD four-speed by adding an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> which the C3 lacked. This transmission {{was introduced in}} Europe on the 1985 Ford Scorpio and in North America with the 1985 Bronco II and Ranger, again with four- and six-cylinder engines only. It {{was replaced by the}} 4R44E and 4R55E in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The Type 9 was Ford's first five-speed, rear-wheel-drive gearbox, and it {{is based}} on the four-speed Type E gearbox. The fifth, or <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear,</b> was added to the four-speed gearbox by placing it in the {{extension}} housing or tailshaft housing. This made production easier and cheaper but effectively limited torque capacity to 200 lb. ft. or so.|$|E
50|$|For 1942, Ford Motor Company {{announced}} a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic. Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, {{as well as an}} electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds. Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill. Lincolns got an <b>overdrive</b> <b>gear</b> as a bonus.|$|E
50|$|The Warner T 93 5 speed {{transmission}} {{had a very}} low first, a direct fourth and an <b>overdrive</b> fifth <b>gear.</b> A power take-off could be fitted to operate a winch (mounted just below {{in front of the}} radiator) and/or the hydraulic hoist on dump trucks (the U10/U11 and U12/U13 dump truck models).|$|R
50|$|Attempts {{to improve}} fuel {{efficiency}} of automatic transmissions {{include the use}} of torque converters that lock up beyond a certain speed or in higher gear ratios, eliminating power loss, and <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears</b> that automatically actuate above certain speeds. In older transmissions, both technologies could be intrusive, when conditions are such that they repeatedly cut in and out as speed and such load factors as grade or wind vary slightly. Current computerized transmissions possess complex programming that both maximizes fuel efficiency and eliminates intrusiveness. This is due mainly to electronic rather than mechanical advances, though improvements in CVT technology and the use of automatic clutches have also helped. A few cars, including the 2013 Subaru Impreza and the 2012 model of the Honda Jazz sold in the UK, actually claim marginally better fuel consumption for the CVT version than the manual version.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford 6R80 {{is based}} on on the ZF 6HP26 6 speed {{automatic}} transmission. Ford manufactures the transmission under license from ZF at the Livonia Transmission Plant in Livonia, Michigan. The 6R80 is featured in 2009 to present Ford F-150 pickups. It features torque converter lockup capabilities in all 6 gears and an integrated [...] "Tow/Haul" [...] mode for enhanced engine braking and towing performance. For the 2011 model year, the transmission was revised to provide smoother shifts, improved fuel economy, and overall better shift performance. Most notable of the improvements was {{the addition of a}} 1 way clutch that provided smoother 1-2 up-shifts and 2-1 down-shifts. The transmission has a relatively low 1st <b>gear</b> and two <b>overdrive</b> <b>gears,</b> the highest of which is 0.69:1. This provides exceptional towing performance when needed, while maximizing fuel economy by offering low engine speeds while cruising.|$|R
