40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{impact of}} serial lumbar {{punctures}} on association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD 4 cell count. DESIGN: Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa. METHODS: Study protocols required four lumbar punctures with measurements of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{over the first}} 2 weeks of treatment and additional lumbar punctures if <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD 4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high <b>pressure.</b> Baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was not associated with}} CD 4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status. Day 14 <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was associated with day 14 fungal burden. Overall mortality was 12 % (20 / 162) at 2 weeks and 26 % (42 / 160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> groups. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Aggressive management of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. The results support increasing access to manometers in resource-poor settings and routine management of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in patients with cryptococcal meningitis...|$|R

In the present investigation the nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was varied with 30 % OSPDS and the combustion, performance, and emissions characteristics were studied and {{compared with those of}} diesel fuel. The different nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> studied were 215 bar, 235 bar, and 255 bar. The results showed that the cylinder pressure with 30 % OSPDS at 235 bar fuel nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressure,</b> was higher than that of diesel fuel as well as at other nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressures.</b> Similarly, the ignition delay was longer with shorter combustion duration in case of 30 % OSPDS at 235 bar nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> The brake thermal efficiency was higher at 235 bar than that of other fuel nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> with OSPDS and lower than that of diesel fuel. The NOx emission was higher and HC and CO emissions were lower with 30 % OSPDS at 235 bar. The smoke emission was marginally lower at 235 bar and marginally higher at 215 bar than diesel fuel.

The use of an ONSD greater than 5 mm on ultrasound as an indicator of increased ICP in a Caucasian population has been studied. However, the cut-off point of this predictor in Chi-nese patients has not been established. Thus, we conducted this study to identify the ONSD criterion for the detection of elevated <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> on lumbar puncture (LP) in a Chinese population and to investigate the influencing factors.

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A differential pressure valve opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> requires surgery to change the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and underdrainage {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Lumbar {{puncture}} is {{a procedure}} that at times can be difficult where it may take multiple attempts to obtain a fluid sample and an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> While {{it is recommended that}} the patient be placed in the lateral recumbent position, many physicians find that placing patients in an upright or sitting position provides an easier access. The theoretical concern is that obtaining an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in the sitting position may be altered. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there is no difference in <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in cerebrospinal fluid in patients placed in a flexed lateral position vs. upright sitting position during lumbar puncture. Methods: 20 consenting patients were entered into a prospective, crossover study who required a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Opening pressure was measured in both recumbent and sitting positions. Starting positions were previously randomized. Means, medians, and ranges were calculated and analyzed. Results: Mean <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in the sitting position ranged from 16 - 53 cm H 20. The mean was 32. 64 cm H 20.

Methods: Retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to a teaching hospital Acute Medical Admissions Unit over a three month period with a presenting complaint of headache.

40|$|Abstract Background The new Certas™ shunt for the {{treatment}} of hydrocephalus has seven standard pressure settings that according to the manufacturer range from 36 to 238 mmH 2 O, and an additional “Virtual Off” setting with an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> > 400 mmH 2 O. Information on actual pressure response and reliability of shunt performance is important in clinical application, especially the “Virtual Off” setting as a non-surgical replacement for shunt ligation. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in-vitro hydrodynamic performance of the Certas™ shunt. Methods Six new Certas™ shunts with proximal and distal catheters were tested with an automated, computerized test system that raised the pressure from zero to a maximum pressure and back to zero at each valve setting. Opening pressure and flow resistance were determined. Results For settings 1 – 7 the measured <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> range was 26 to 247 mmH 2 O, and the mean change in <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for a one-step adjustment was between 33 and 38 mmH 2 O. For setting 8 (“Virtual Off”) the measured mean <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was 494 [*]±[*] 34 mmH 2 O (range 451 to 556 mmH 2 O). The mean outflow resistance was 7. 0 [*]mmHg/ml/min (outflow conductance 17. 9 μl/s/kPa). Conclusions The six shunts had similar characteristics and closely matched the manufacturer’s specifications for <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at settings 1 – 7. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the “Virtual Off” setting was nearly 500 mmH 2 O, which is 100 mmH 2 O higher than the manufacturer’s specification of “> 400 ” and should be functionally off for most patients with communicating hydrocephalus.
