40|$|The bundle {{flowline}} involves packaging multiple flowlines, control, and {{injection lines}} {{within a single}} carrier pipe. A bundle is claimed to provide {{an effective means of}} insulating flowlines by use of low-cost materials; however, no rigorous <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> analysis of bundled flowline systems has been offered by the literature or the vendors. For this reason, the thermal performance of bundle-insulated flowlines has been studied with a general-purpose, finite-element, partial-differential equation solver. Steady-state and transient cooldown performance were analyzed for six different bundle configurations. <b>Overall</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>coefficients</b> for individual flowlines within a bundle have been determined in addition to cooldown performance for different insulation levels and pipe sizes. These results have been compared with results obtained for the simple bundle geometry of a pipe-in-pipe system, and found comparable. To expedite the calculation of <b>overall</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>coefficients</b> for bundle flowlines, simplified <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> calculations were developed as an approximation to the finite-element solutions.

40|$|Experiments of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> and {{pressure}} drop in a polymer compact heat exchanger made of PolyVinyliDene-Fluoride were conducted under various conditions for air/water heat exchange and air-steam/water heat exchange, respectively.

40|$|Thermal balloon {{ablation}} is {{a modern}} non surgical procedure {{for the treatment of}} menorrhagia. It works on the principle of ablating the endometrial layer beyond a point of regeneration thereby reducing blood loss. Mathematical modelling of this procedure helps in improving accuracy of the treatment which reduces adverse affects of the procedure thereby making the procedure safer. Pennes bio-heat equation is used to calculate transient temperature in the uterine cavity. Thermal injury integral is used to calculate the irreversible thermal destruction of the uterine tissue. When thermal injury integral equals to or is greater than 1, the tissue is destroyed which prevents regeneration of the endometrium. The presented mathematical model is verified with the published experimental findings to check the validity of the model. The effect of <b>overall</b> convective <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>coefficient</b> and balloon fluid temperature on tissue damage is studied. For an <b>overall</b> convective <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>coefficient</b> above 2000 Wm- 2 K- 1, maximum depth of ablation at 87 °C was 3. 77 mm. For higher fluid temperature, depth of ablation is found to increase. At a fluid temperature of 93 °C, depth of ablation is found to be 4. 39 mm for an <b>overall</b> convective <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>coefficient</b> 1000 Wm- 2 K- 1.
