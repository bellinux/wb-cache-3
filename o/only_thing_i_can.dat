The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

First Class marks the first English-language film for González, who auditioned while taking English classes in London. He enjoyed playing a villain as most of his film roles in Spain were for [...] "good guys", and compared Riptide's respectable and polite personality, which can suddenly be dropped to perform fierce attacks, to a hurricane; in a translation of a Portuguese-language interview, he is quoted as saying, [...] "When I see a hurricane from far, it is calm.

2500|$|After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: [...] "I'm {{still in}} shock. I still can't believe I did that. This one hurts {{more than any}} tournament because I had it won.

2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season. He finished the year with 63wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said [...] "I don't know why but nothing really went right.

2500|$|In January 1997 Magee and {{the other}} five escapees from Whitemoor were on trial on charges {{relating}} to the escape for a second time, four months earlier the first trial had been stopped because of prejudicial publicity. Lawyers for the defendants successfully argued that {{an article in the}} Evening Standard prejudiced the trial as it contained photographs of Magee and two other defendants and described them as [...] "terrorists", as an order had been made {{at the start of the}} trial preventing any reference to the background and previous convictions of the defendants.

[...] The album incorporates themes involving both personal and political conflict, and Morissette explained that [...] "Our emotions align themselves with larger symptomatic things in the world. We face a large war out there, but [...] more closely reflects the war in people's living rooms... the icy silence at home, versus the big cold war." [...] Morissette summarized the track [...] "Moratorium" [...] as being [...] "essentially a song about my readiness to stop repeating bad patterns. I've kicked some of those in my life." [...] She said of [...] "Not as We", [...] "You know how you can resist hitting rock bottom for a long time? That song just goes 'OK, I'm going. All the way down'".
