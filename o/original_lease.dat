25|$|According to Braves team {{president}} John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $150million in renovation costs merely for structural upkeep (i.e., not for fan experience improvements). He estimated that fan improvement renovations {{would have cost}} an additional $200million. The Braves were in talks in 2013 with the Recreational Authority over extending the team's <b>original</b> <b>lease,</b> Plant said, but those talks broke down. Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed said the city {{could not afford to}} support the kind of renovations the Braves desired.|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 {{closed season}} the {{football}} pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment {{being made in}} the playing surface {{so that it is}} better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage. In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of [...] £3million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000. This new agreement occurred as part of a standard five-year review of the <b>original</b> <b>lease</b> and it amounts to an approximate £1million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium.|$|E
500|$|St Anne's-on-the-Sea is {{a planned}} seaside resort on the Fylde coast, {{at the mouth}} of the River Ribble, in Lancashire. It was {{developed}} in the 19th century, largely by the St Anne's Land & Building Company. The company was formed in 1874 and leased land for the new town from the estate of the local Clifton family. Towards the end of the 19th century, pleasure piers became a common feature of English seaside resorts, and by the 1870s there were already two piers in nearby Blackpool (now called North and Central Piers), one in Southport and one [...] away in Lytham. The wording of the land company's <b>original</b> <b>lease</b> indicates that a pier was probably planned for St Anne's from its beginning. A subsidiary, the St Anne's-on-the-Sea Pier and Improvements Company was formed in 1877. The company directors believed that a pier at St Anne's would offer visitors better conditions for fishing and boating than those at neighbouring resorts.|$|E

Lyly's Campaspe was performed at Blackfriars [...] and subsequently at Court on New Year's Day 1584; likewise, his Sapho and Phao was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as the payee for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the <b>original</b> <b>lease</b> at the end of Easter Term (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly's third play, Gallathea.|$|E

50|$|The Lord of the Manor of Market End was the Earl of Derby who in 1597 sold a 9,999-year lease to 31 {{principal}} tenants.

The leaseholders elected a bailiff to receive the profits from the bailiwick, mainly from the administration of the market and distribute them to the shareholders. From the bailiff's title the arrangement became known as the Bailiwick of Bicester Market End.

50|$|The {{sublessor}} remains {{liable to}} the original lessor {{in accordance with the}} initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other <b>original</b> <b>lease</b> terms.

However, if market prices have increased since the <b>original</b> <b>lease</b> was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the original lessor. However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1920s, architects Thomas Ramsay Hall and George Gray Prentice {{designed}} substantial three-storeyed extensions {{for these}} sites. The work {{was carried out}} by contractor Francis Joseph Corbett, who started in late 1925 and finished in March 1928. The <b>original</b> <b>leased</b> premises, fronting George Street, were demolished and replaced with a three-storeyed extension of the 1912 building. A separate but adjoining three-storeyed building was erected on the Tank Street sites. The extensions conformed with the 1912 street elevations, and featured the latest fittings, elevators and modern conveniences. At the same time, new shop fronts were installed in the corner building by contractors Robertson & Corbett. The founders of the firm just lived to see the extensions completed: Hubert East died in May 1928, and Frank McDonnell followed him six months later. Fraser East and Jack McDonnell took over as joint managing directors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{government}} encouraged {{private investment}} in Habila {{and the land}} was divided into feddans (about 0.4 ha), which were then leased out to private operators. The <b>original</b> <b>leases</b> were to be left fallow after four years and new leases were to be let for adjacent fallow plots to prevent soil exhaustion. By 1979, about 147 000 ha were officially leased under official schemes sorghum but production was greatly expanded {{and the proportion of}} fallow land decreased dramatically, with about 45 per cent of mechanized agriculture produced in illegal areas by 1985. Farmers who sought quick profits eventually led the land to exhaustion. This occurred in many other places in Sudan following government policy in the 1970s to [...] "become the bread basket of the Arab world".Poor planning led to drought, internal warfare and famine as the soils become unfertile and unsustainable in Habila and reached a crisis in 1994.|$|R
