5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, {{with the condition}} that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain {{to meet him at}} the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} {{departed}} Guam at 23:43. As {{the second wave}} landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> radio in the other. His request {{to speak with the}} ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal. The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on Guam at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Criticism and {{skepticism}} {{towards the}} field of Transpersonal psychology has been presented by a wide assortment of commentators, and includes both writers from within its own ranks, as well as writers representing other fields of psychology or philosophy.

25|$|In the 19th century, the {{reported}} Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes gathered significant attention, and provided momentum for {{the spread of}} the Rosary. The spread of the devotion to both the Rosary and the Scapular was influenced by Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917. The Fatima messages placed a strong emphasis on the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as The Lady of the Rosary. The visions and messages also encouraged the wearing of the Brown Scapular. In the final Fátima appearance on October 13, 1917 the Virgin Mary had a brown scapular in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> rosary in the other.|$|E

25|$|The rosary was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917. The reported Fatima messages place {{a strong emphasis on}} the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary is identified as The Lady of the Rosary. According to Lucia Santos (one of the three children) in one of the apparitions the Virgin Mary has a rosary in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Brown scapular in the other hand. Reports of the Fatima apparitions helped spread rosary devotions and a Fatima prayer is now often added to the end of rosary recitations. The Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary, Fatima, was built at that site in 1953 and has fifteen altars, each dedicated to a mystery of the rosary.|$|E
25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here.

25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival.
