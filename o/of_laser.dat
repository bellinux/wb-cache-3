5|$|In August 1997, {{the first}} {{production}} laser {{adaptive cruise control}} on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the Celsior version (Japan only) It controlled speed only through throttle control and downshifting, but did not apply the brakes. Because <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> technology limitations, it deactivated in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} US market Lexus with {{adaptive}} cruise control (called Dynamic Laser Cruise Control). It employed a lidar sensor and (unlike the laser ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior) was able to activate brakes for deceleration. However, because <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> technology limitations, it would deactivate in bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via bronchoscopy {{for the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement.

5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} <b>of</b> <b>lasers</b> {{reduces the}} number of longitudinal modes in the output beam; the more lasers are combined, the smaller is {{the number of}} longitudinal modes in the output. The simple estimates show that the number of output modes reduces exponentially with number <b>of</b> <b>lasers</b> combined. <b>Of</b> order <b>of</b> eight <b>lasers</b> can be combined in such a way. The future increase of number <b>of</b> combined <b>lasers</b> requires the exponential growth of the spectral bandwidth of gain and/or length <b>of</b> partial <b>lasers.</b> The same conclusion can be made also on the base of more detailed simulations. Practically, the combination of more than ten lasers with a passive combining arrangement appears to be difficult. However, active coherent combining <b>of</b> <b>lasers</b> has the potential to scale to very large numbers of channels.|$|R

5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence}} that microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention <b>of</b> <b>laser</b> beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
