40|$|The {{histological}} analysis enabled {{to distinguish}} the main types of polyembryony in maize according to the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> connected with their localization in caryopses, differences in their structure (presence of common tissues) and type of germination. Twin embryos from multiple embryo sacs are usually localized on opposite sides (or distant places) of the caryopsis, they have no common tissues and the germination is separate. Twins or triplets from individual cells of the egg apparatus or multiple egg cells are closely adherent, but strictly separated by epidermal layers. Endosperm is common. Plumules and radicles are independent. Cleavage polyembryos arising in vivo spontaneously or after induction share a common suspensor, part of scutellum and surface layers of radicles. Therefore they germinate with one radicular complex and with separated plumules...|$|E
40|$|This review {{contains}} two parts. The first part {{is devoted to}} the significant steps in cryopreservation of mammalian embryos with emphasis on cattle and sheep that serve as models of reference. These steps are: (1) shortening of cooling and warming processes; (2) addition and dilution of cryoprotectant in one step; (3) introduction of plastic straw as a freezing and dilution container; (4) the choice of ethylene glycol as the quite universal cryoprotectant because of its low toxicity and high permeability; (5) vitrification, a cryopreservation method which enable passage from the liquid to the solid state by extreme elevation of viscosity due to high concentration of cryoprotectants and very rapid cooling. There are several vitrification solutions which contain dimethyl sulphoxide, glycerol, ethylene glycol, or a mixture of them, as basic cryoprotectants. The second part considers some factors affecting the efficiency of cryopreservation concerning (i) the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> and (ii) the stage of development and species. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> (in vivo versus in vitro) : in vitro embryos show a chilling and freezing sensitivity associated with their lipid content which can be modified by the culture conditions. Both conventional freezing and vitrification have been used and it seems that vitrification is more adapted to in vitro embryos when some modifications of initial protocols are carried out, particularly the rate of cooling. Thus considerable progress has been achieved by using the open pulled straw method of Vajta which enables the use of a minimum volume of freezing medium (0. 5 microl) and a very high cooling rate that permits rapid traversal of the damaging temperature zone, corresponding to chilling sensitivity. The stage of development and species: not only are there differences between species at the same stage of development but in the same species all stages of development do not survive equally under the same freezing protocol. In cattle for example, oocytes and early stages of development in vivo or in vitro do not survive whereas compacted morulae and blastocysts survive very well. In the pig hatched blastocysts survive better than the other stages. Horse embryos have special characteristics that pose problems for successful freezing. In conclusion, a lot of work remains to be done to define fundamental characteristics of embryos of certain species (pig, horse) and of embryos of some stages or of oocytes...|$|E
50|$|The {{propagation}} of shoots or nodal segments is usually performed in four stages for mass production of plantlets through in vitro vegetative multiplication but organogenesis {{is a common}} method of micropropagation that involves tissue regeneration of adventitious organs or axillary buds directly orindirectly from the explants.

DESIGN: Optimization and validation applied to cell lines and clinical samples (polar bodies, blastomeres, and trophectoderm biopsies). SETTING: University research laboratory and a {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) reference laboratory. PATIENT(S) : Samples from 65 couples who underwent PGD for aneuploidy and/or a single-gene disorder. INTERVENTION(S) : None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : 1) Comparison of aneuploidy screening results obtained {{with the use of}} the new microarray with those derived from two well established cytogenetic techniques. 2) mtDNA quantification. 3) Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULT(S) : The fully optimized microarray was estimated to have an accuracy of ≥ 97 % for the detection of individual aneuploidies and to detect 99 % of chromosomally abnormal embryos. The microarray was shown to accurately determine relative quantities of mtDNA. Information provided from polymorphic loci was sufficient to allow confirmation that an embryo was derived from specific parents. CONCLUSION(S) : It is hoped that methods such as those reported here, which provide information on several aspects of oocyte/embryo genetics, could lead to improved strategies for identifying viable embryos, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful implantation.

40|$|In {{the marine}} realm, {{two of the}} main {{stressors}} causing significant changes are ocean warming and acidification. Of particular concern are organisms reliant on the generation of calcium carbonate, such as corals. Reproduction and population structure are strongly related to environmental parameters and may be indicators for stability or decline of coral populations. Part of my research focused on the reproductive cycle of the Mediterranean non-zooxanthellate coral Caryophyllia inornata in relation to seasonal variations of seawater temperature and photoperiod. Moreover, an unusual embryogenesis was found in females, males and inactive individuals during the entire year, indicating a possible agamic <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos.</b> This was a pilot study for a broader investigation along a wide latitudinal gradient of temperature and solar radiation. Reproductive traits of this coral do not vary along the gradient as observed for another non-zooxanthellate species, Leptopsammia pruvoti, indicating that these species could be quite tolerant to environmental changes, {{probably due to the}} lack of symbiosis with the zooxanthellae. A study on the spermatogenesis of the zooxanthellate coral Balanophyllia europaea living along a natural pCO 2 gradient showed no significant variations with low pH. We hypothesized that high CO 2 levels probably enhance zooxanthellae photosynthesis, leading to an increase of the available energy for gonadal development. The ability to reproduce in particular conditions is related to population structure, providing information on coral responses to the environment. I investigated the population structure of the tropical coral Montastraea cavernosa along a depth gradient in Bermuda. Deeper populations were characterized by smaller but more numerous colonies compared to shallow ones, with no variation in the percent cover among depths. Thus, mesophotic populations of M. cavernosa in Bermuda seem quite stable, indicating that these reefs may serve as a source of propagules to maintain shallower reefs and help guide future management and conservation strategies...|$|E

To test this, we used AGL 15 -specific antibodies to analyze apomictic embryogenesis in dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), microspore embryogenesis in oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and somatic embryogenesis in alfalfa (Medicago sativa).

Furthermore, the subcellular localization of AGL 15 appeared to be developmentally regulated in all embryogenic situations. AGL 15 was initially present in the cytoplasm of cells and became nuclear localized before or soon after embryogenic cell divisions began.

40|$|International audienceART is {{suspected}} to generate increased imprinting {{errors in the}} lineage. Following an ICSI (Intra Cytoplamic Sperm Injection) procedure, a certain number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> fail to develop normally and imprinting disorders may be associated to the developmental failure. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analysed the methylation profile of H 19 DMR, a paternally imprinting control region, in high graded blastocysts, in embryos showing developmental anomalies, in the matching sperm and in oocytes of the concerned couples when they were available. Significant hypomethylation of the paternal allele was observed in half the <b>embryos,</b> independently <b>of</b> the stage at which they were arrested (morula, compacted morula, pre blastocyst or BC graded blastocysts). Conversely, some embryos showed significant methylation on the maternal allele, whereas few others showed both, hypomethylation of the paternal allele and abnormal methylation of the maternal allele. The matching sperm at the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> exhibited normal methylated H 19 patterns. Thus, hypomethylation of the paternal allele in the embryos does not appear inherited from the sperm but likely reflects instability of the imprint during the demethylating process which occurred in the early <b>embryo.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> a few oocytes suggests that the defect in erasure of the paternal imprint in the maternal germ line {{may be responsible for}} the residual methylation of the maternal allele in some <b>embryos.</b> None <b>of</b> these imprinting alterations could be related to a particular stage of developmental arrest; compared to high grade blastocysts, embryos with developmental failure {{are more likely to have}} abnormal imprinting at H 19 (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R

The genotype of the mother plant donor of explants and the kind of auxin play essential roles in conferring embryogenic competence. Once obtained somatic embryos may be encapsulated in alginate originating synthetic seeds that can be stored at low temperatures. Considering this the present work aimed at the assessment of five different genotypes, five periods of 2, 4 -D shock (20 mM for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks) (), and different substances supplemented to sodium alginate to obtain synthetic seeds.

40|$|The {{inactivation}} of metaphase-promoting factor (MPF), {{leading to}} reactivation of the oocyte cell cycle after fertilization, {{is one of}} the most important results of oocyte activation in the case of intracytoplasmic injection of mature or immature sperm cells. Oocyte activation is a cell signalling event that is likely to imply receptors at the oocyte plasma membrane and a signal transduction pathway involving calcium and protein phosphorylation/dephosphoryla-tion. The typical calcium signal during oocyte activation in mammals takes the form of calcium oscillations. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is associated with a slightly different pattern of calcium oscillations in comparison with normal fertilization. Available data suggest that sperm cytosolic factor(s) play a role of oscillator, modulating the properties of the oocyte's intracellular calcium stores, whereas the role of trigger, normally realized by sperm-oocyte interactions at the level of their respective cell surfaces, can be supplemented in the condi-tions of ICSI by an artificial calcium influx generated by the procedure itself. Delayed onset and an abnormal form of the oocyte activation-promoting calcium signal are the two known molecular abnormalities of human oocyte activation; they can lead to fertilization failure and are also suspected to be at the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> various <b>embryo</b> abnormalities. The impact of oocyte activation abnormalities on future devel-opment increases when oocytes are fertilized with immature sperm cells (spermatids) because the chromatin of these cells is less protected than sperm chromatin against a rapid action of the oocyte's MPF. If oocyte stimulation by the sperm calcium oscillation-promoting activity, which first appears at the round spermatid stage of human spermatogenesis, is insufficient to cause a rapid inactivation of MPF, premature condensation of spermatid chromatids may lead to aneuploidy.

Material and Methods : Somatic embryogenesis was induced on immature zygotic <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> diverse oak species, permitting the multiplication of half-sib families. Induction <b>of</b> haploid <b>embryos</b> and doubled haploids was assayed in both Q. suber and Q. ilex by temperature stress treatments of anthers containing late vacuolated microspores. The haploid <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the anther <b>embryos</b> has been evaluated by quantitative nuclear DNA analysis through flow cytometry and by DNA microsatellite markers. Genetic transformation of cork oak {{has also been}} performed by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens vectors. Proteomic analysis has been conducted to screen the diverse protein profiles followed by in vitro derived embryos during their development. Research highlights : Successful plant regeneration from both somatic and haploid embryos has been achieved. In the particular case of cork oak, doubled-haploid plants were obtained. Plantlets regenerated from selected parent trees through somatic embryogenesis were acclimated in the greenhouse and in the nursery, and were planted in an experimental plot in the field. Preliminary evaluation of the cork quality of the plants showed a good heritability correlation with the parent trees. This article revises the work of and is dedicated to Dr. M. A.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} what factors control the differentiation of certain neural crest cells in the chick embryo. Emphasis was placed on the morphologically and biochemically divergent sensory and sympathetic pathways <b>of</b> differentiation. <b>Embryos</b> were precisely staged according to Hamburger & Hamilton (1951) and it was observed that sensory ganglia with somites, explanted at stages 21 - 24, gave rise to cells showing formalde-hyde-induced fluorescence in more than 25 % of explants. These cells were identical in properties to the fluorescent cells of the sympathetic system <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> similar age, and appeared by 12 days in vitro. These fluorescent cells did not appear when somites and sensory ganglia explants were maintained separately. The incidence of fluorescent cells in combined explants was considerably reduced or absent when cultures were maintained for 7 days or less, or when the explants were obtained from stage 25 - 26 embryos. Furthermore, when neural tube was also included in the cultures, the appearance of fluorescent cells was markedly inhibited. The requirement for somitic tissue to induce fluorescent cells in combined explants can be replaced by forelimb-bud tissue. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> these cells and the factors that control their differentiation in vitro are discussed with reference to the neural crest <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the sensory ganglion, and the possible conditions pertaining in vivo in this region...|$|R

40|$|In {{cork oak}} (Quercus suber L.), {{recurrent}} embryogenesis {{is produced in}} vitro through autoembryony without exogenous plant growth regulators (PGRs); secondary embryos appear on the embryo axis but seldom on cotyledons. Focusing mainly on the histological <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> neoformations, we investigated the influence <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> axis and exogenous PGRs on the embryogenic potential <b>of</b> somatic <b>embryo</b> cotyledons. Isolated cotyledons <b>of</b> somatic <b>embryos</b> became necrotic when cultured on PGR-free medium but gave secondary embryos when cultured on media containing benzyladenine and naphthaleneacetic acid. Cotyledons of cork oak somatic embryos are competent to give embryogenic responses. Isolated cotyledons without a petiole showed a lower percentage of embryogenic response than did those with a petiole. In petioles, somatic embryos arose from inner parenchyma tissues following a multicellular budding pattern. Joined to the embryo axis, cotyledons did not show morphogenic responses when cultured on PGR-free medium but revealed budlike and phylloid formations when cultured on medium with PGRs. The different morphogenic behavior displayed by somatic cotyledons indicates an influence <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> axis and indicates a relationship between organogenic and embryogenic regeneration pathway...|$|R

This noninvasive technique allows one to correlate the shape of blood vessels to the physical, micro-structural, pattern {{that exists in the}} embryo prior to vessel appearance. Before any vessel forms, vascular paths are present and are prepatterned, by fields of cellular orientations and lumen anisotropies. We find the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> this prepattern in the movements <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> during gastrulation, and the related deformation and force field, which establish both the animal and vascular pattern...|$|R
