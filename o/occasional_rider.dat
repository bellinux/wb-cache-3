Yet despite that, and a brazen, unconcealed admiration, there was not lacking kindliness and sympathy and good nature. Presently Joan sauntered away, and she went among the tired, shaggy horses and made friends with them. An <b>occasional</b> <b>rider</b> swung up the trail to dismount before Kells's cabin, and once two riders rode in, both staring--all eyes--at her. The meaning of her intent alertness dawned upon her then. Always, whatever she was doing or thinking or saying, behind it all hid the driving watchfulness for Jim Cleve. And the consciousness of this fixed her mind upon him. Where was he? What was he doing? Was he drunk or gambling or fighting or sleeping? Was he still honest? When she did meet him what would happen? How could she make herself and circumstances known to him before he killed somebody? A new fear had birth and grew--Cleve would recognize her in that disguise, mask and all.|$|E

The aim of this thesis was to map the current situation in the breeding of horses for re-gion Blansko. In {{the introductory part of}} the paper I am describing the district separately aa well as the situation of horse breeding in general. In the practical part I wanted to map the current situation of horse breeding from both the owners, breeders, and the cavalry company point of view. For this part of the thesis I developed a questionnaire, which I then split into two parts. One section deals with issues for horse owners in the district Blansko and the second part is devoted to <b>occasional</b> <b>riders</b> or riders who rent horses. The resulting data were further developed and evaluated. The results of the survey were compared with the results of a survey of the region Zlín, which was elaborated in the thesis in 2010, and the results of the survey in the region Pardubice and the region Vysočina, which were processed in the thesis, 2012...|$|R

40|$|This instructor's manual is {{designed}} for use by an experienced cyclist to teach a 10 -week, 30 -hour course. The course provides on-bike and classroom instruction in defensive maneuvers in traffic, long-distance riding, health and physiology, bike maintenance, legal considerations of biking, and route selection. Po. fticipants {{should be at least}} <b>occasional</b> <b>riders</b> who can ride with reasonable competence and confidence; instructors may establish additional prerequisites. Section I provides general information for potential sponsors, including a course description, logisticp and outline. Section II discusses instructional strategies for classroom and on-bike instruction. Section III contains outlines for the 10 classes and student handouts. The outlines include factual material and informative diagrams. Each class covers a variety of topics, including basic skills of riding; riding on uncrowded streets; riding in moderate and heavy traffic; emergency maneuvers; touring; bike selection and fit; equipment, brakes, basic posture and pedaling techniques; laws; wheels; bicycle accidents; safety hints; intersections; tires; changers; conditioning; gears and gearing; commuting; bicycle security; chain and freewheel; headset and stem; racing; bottom bracket; bike facilities; and bike carriers.

5000|$|In an {{ordinary}} stage of road bicycle racing, all riders start simultaneously {{and share the}} road. Riders are permitted to touch and to shelter behind each other. Riding in each other's slipstreams is crucial to race tactics: a lone rider has little chance of outracing {{a small group of}} riders who can take turns in the strenuous position {{at the front of the}} group. The majority of riders form a single large group, the [...] "pack" [...] (in French, the [...] "peloton"), with attacking groups ahead of it and the <b>occasional</b> struggling <b>rider</b> dropping behind. In mountainous stages the peloton is likely to become fragmented, but in flat stages a split is rare.|$|R
40|$|The public {{images of}} cycling {{can act as}} {{barriers}} or facilitators of cycling. This qualitative study explored images and perceptions of cycling, their potential influence on cycling and whether these views differed between regular, occasional and non-riders. Seventy participants (24 males and 46 females) were recruited. Of these, 22 were classified as non-riders, 23 were <b>occasional</b> <b>riders</b> and 25 were regular riders. Twelve focus groups were held in inner Sydney during October and November 2005. Data were audio taped, transcribed and thematically analysed. Themes linked to images of cycling included: 'clean and green'; 'healthy and fun'; 'dangerous' and 'serious business'. Themes linked to images of cyclists included: 'risk takers and law breakers' and 'status and sub-cultures'. Discussion centred on the low social status of riding over other transport modes, the relative acceptability of different riding sub-cultures, the 'green' image of cycling transport and the status associated with the riders clothing and bicycle choice, especially lycra and its 'serious and sporty' connotation. While 'cycling' was generally viewed as a positive, environmentally friendly activity, the actions of some 'cyclists' were disliked, which influenced views about cycling, particularly among non-riders. A cycling acceptability hierarchy emerged; with recreational riding at the top, followed by cycling for sport and exercise, with transport/commuter cycling towards the bottom. Bicycle couriers were viewed least favourably. A common perception among non-riders was the latter two groups were rule breakers and risk takers, while regular riders felt unfairly judged by this stereotype. While there was greater acceptance of recreational riding, riding for transport was not viewed as a mainstream activity. There {{is a need to}} improve the public acceptability of cycling and change public norms so it is seen as an everyday activity that can be undertaken by almost anyone, without the need for special clothing, expensive equipment or limited to purpose built facilities.

40|$|IntroductionIn 2013, {{injuries}} to bicyclists accounted for 925 fatalities and 493, 884 nonfatal, emergency department-treated {{injuries in the}} United States. Bicyclist deaths increased by 19 % from 2010 to 2013. The greatest risk of death and disability to bicyclists is head injuries. The objective {{of this study was}} to provide estimates of prevalence and associated factors of bicycle riding and helmet use among children and adults in the United States. MethodCDC analyzed self-reported data from the 2012 Summer ConsumerStyles survey. Adult respondents (18 + years) were asked about bicycle riding and helmet use in the last 30 days for themselves and their children (5 to 17 years). For bicycle riders, CDC estimated the prevalence of helmet use and conducted multivariable regression analyses to identify factors associated with helmet use. ResultsAmong adults, 21 % rode bicycles within the past 30 days and 29 % always wore helmets. Respondents reported that, of the 61 % of children who rode bicycles within the past 30 days, 42 % always wore helmets. Children were more likely to always wear helmets (90 %) when their adult respondents always wore helmets than when their adult respondents did not always wear helmets (38 %). Children who lived in states with a child bicycle helmet law were more likely to always wear helmets (47 %) than those in states without a law (39 %). ConclusionsDespite the fact that bicycle helmets are highly effective at reducing the risk for head injuries, including severe brain injuries and death, less than half of children and adults always wore bicycle helmets while riding. Practical applicationStates and communities should consider interventions that improve the safety of riding such as policies to promote helmet use, modeling of helmet wearing by adults, and focusing on high risk groups, including Hispanic cyclists, <b>occasional</b> <b>riders,</b> adults, and children ages 10 to 14.

He completed his domination of every bonuses on offer that day by taking the last sprint in El Dorado. The breakaway enjoyed a maximum advantage of {{a little more than}} five minutes. The crosswinds were about 15 mph and the terrain very flat and open. Still, no breaks were reported in the bunch as [...] were controlling the pace with an <b>occasional</b> [...] <b>rider</b> chipping in. Former stage winner Jens Voigt was invited to speak with the television commentators and expressed the opinion that the breakaway had very little chance of making it all the way. With 15 mi to go, the gap was 2 minutes 40 seconds and Voigt humorously changed his mind and said the escape would make it.|$|R

He stepped in for the injured Alex Hofmann in China and stunned the series regulars by finishing 2nd to Valentino Rossi on the factory Kawasaki.
