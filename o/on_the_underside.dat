5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of its flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside.</b> Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of its cap {{rather than}} gills. These are {{coloured}} white at first, becoming yellow {{with age and}} olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E

50|$|The {{evergreen}} {{leaves are}} leathery and thick. They are bicolored: white and quite woolly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> and dull gray- or yellow-green and faintly hairy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper surfaces. <b>The</b> wool <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> of <b>the</b> leaves {{is made up}} of star-shaped leaf hairs that are fused into microscopic plates. The leaf blades are oval with smooth or toothed edges, and measure 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (1.0-1.4 inches) in length.|$|R

5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males {{tend to have}} fewer spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large {{subspecies}} weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E
50|$|Englerophytum {{consists}} {{primarily of}} trees. Their leaves are leathery with dense appressed hairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides.</b> <b>The</b> genus is widespread across tropical and southern Africa.|$|R
50|$|Theridula spiders are {{frequently}} found on bushes or tall grass where they rest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> of leaves near their webs.|$|R
50|$|Spores {{are located}} in rounded sori <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> of <b>the</b> fronds, and are {{released}} in cool weather and high humidity.|$|R
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with light brown or black. The scales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.|$|E

5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874. A {{member of the family}} Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, which is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> {{of the head and}} faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
