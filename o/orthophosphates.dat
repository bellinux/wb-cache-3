The addition of ca. 110 nM <b>orthophosphate</b> to a ca. 16 km 2 patch in situ led, within 1 day, to an increase in particulate-P from 8 to ca. 15 nM, a result in good agreement with a previous microcosm bioassay indicating this system to have a maximum capacity for <b>orthophosphate</b> consumption of between 10 and 25 nM phosphate.

40|$|Abstract. Liquid {{polyphosphate}} fertilisers contain both <b>orthophosphate</b> and pyrophosphate, {{and have}} shown significant yield increases compared to granular <b>orthophosphate</b> fertiliser on highly phosphorus (P) fixing soils. The P sorption chemistry {{of the dominant}} P species in a polyphosphate fertiliser (pyrophosphate and <b>orthophosphate)</b> was compared {{on a range of}} Australian soils, and the effect of these P species on equilibrium solution chemistry was also examined. Phosphorus supplied as pyrophosphate had a stronger sorption affinity than <b>orthophosphate</b> in all soils. The greater efficiency of pyrophosphate-based fertiliser on some soil types is therefore not due to reduced sorption of this P supplied as pyrophosphate compared to P supplied as <b>orthophosphate</b> fertiliser. In general, the addition of pyrophosphate to soil resulted in a larger decrease in calcium concentration in solution compared to <b>orthophosphate.</b> In contrast, there was an increase in iron concentration in solution with pyrophosphate addition, indicating sequestration reactions associated with the dissolution of dissolved organic carbon into soil solution. The pyrophosphate ion generally mobilised more Fe into solution than <b>orthophosphate</b> in several soils, likely through complexation reactions leading to Fe desorption/dissolution from the soil solid phase. These findings highlight the differences in soil chemical reactions that occur with the addition of polyphosphate fertilisers, which may contribute to their yield advantage in some soil types...|$|R
5000|$|Zirconium {{phosphate}} {{crystal structure}} was elucidated by Clearfield and coworkers in 1968 by the single-crystal method. [...] The layered structure of α-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) ions situated alternately slightly {{above and below}} the ab plane, forming an octahedron with the oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral phosphate groups. Of the four oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups, three are bonded to three different Zr atoms, forming a cross-linked covalent network. The fourth oxygen atom of the phosphate is perpendicular to the layer pointed toward the interlayer region. In the interlayer region is localized a zeolitic cavity where a basal water molecule resides, forming a hydrogen bond with the OH group of the phosphate that is perpendicular to the layer. The alpha phase of zirconium phosphate is under the P21/n space group, with cell dimensions of a = 9.060 Å, b = 5.297 Å, c = 15.414 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 101.71° and Z = 4.21 The basal interlayer distance for the α-Zirconium phosphate is 7.6 Å, where 6.6 Å is the layer thickness and the remaining 1 Å space is occupied by the interstitial water molecules in the interlayer gallery. The distance between adjacent <b>orthophosphates</b> {{on one side of the}} layer is 5.3 Å.

40|$|Long-term {{application}} of phosphorus (P) with animal manure in amounts exceeding removal with crops leads to buildup of P in soil and to increasing risk of P loss to surface water and eutrophication. In most manures, {{the majority of}} P is held within inorganic forms, but in soil leachates organic P forms often dominate. We investigated the mobility of both inorganic and organic P in profile samples from a noncalcareous sandy soil treated for 11 yr with excessive amounts of pig slurry, poultry manure, or poultry manure mixed with litter. Solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize NaOH-EDTA-extractable forms of P, corresponding to 64 to 93 % of the total P concentration in soil. <b>Orthophosphate</b> and <b>orthophosphate</b> monoesters were the main P forms detected in the NaOHEDTA extracts.
