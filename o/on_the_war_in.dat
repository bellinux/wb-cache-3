5|$|Even before Cornwallis's {{surrender}} in October, Benedict Arnold {{had requested}} permission from Clinton {{to go to}} England to give Lord George Germain his thoughts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> person. When word of the surrender reached New York, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 1382, Richard {{ordered the}} crusade to be {{published}} throughout England. Later that month the bishop and his men took the cross at St. Paul's Cathedral. In February 1383 Parliament, after hesitating in entrusting the mission to a churchman, ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Flanders. The king's only stipulation was that the crusaders should await the arrival of William Beauchamp before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French soldiers. For a very brief period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E

At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Riego's Revolt had two {{significant}} effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Americas. Militarily, {{the large numbers}} of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.|$|E

25|$|As {{the tide}} of the war turned toward the former slaves, Napoleon {{abandoned}} his dreams of restoring France's New World empire. In 1803, war resumed between France and Britain, and with the Royal Navy firmly {{in control of the}} seas, reinforcements and supplies for Rochambeau never arrived in sufficient numbers. To concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Europe, Napoleon signed the Louisiana Purchase in April, selling France's North American possessions to the United States. The Haitian army, now led by Dessalines, devastated Rochembeau and the French army at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803.|$|E

25|$|Paraguayan {{women had}} a {{significant}} role in the Paraguayan War. During the period just before the war began many Paraguayan women were the heads of their households, meaning they held a position of power and authority. They received such positions by being widows, having children out of wedlock, or their husbands worked as peons. When the war began women started to venture out of the home becoming nurses, working with government, and establishing themselves into the public sphere. When the New York Times reported <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> 1868 they considered Paraguayan women equal to their male counterparts.|$|E

25|$|In April 1712 he left Harwich for Rotterdam to {{lead the}} British troops {{taking part in the}} war. Once there he allowed himself to be made the tool of the Tory ministry, whose policy was to carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands while giving secret orders to Ormonde to take no active part in {{supporting}} their allies under Prince Eugene of Savoy. In July 1712 Ormonde advised Prince Eugene that he could no longer support the siege of Quesnoy and that he was withdrawing the British troops from the action and instead intended to take possession of Dunkirk. The Dutch were so exasperated at the withdrawal of the British troops that they closed the towns of Bouchain on Douai to British access {{despite the fact that they}} had plenty of stores and medical facilities available. Ormonde took possession of Ghent and Bruges as well as Dunkirk in order to ensure his troops were adequately provided for. On 15 April 1713 he became Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|The consuls for 296 BC were Appius Claudius Caecus and Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens. The {{previous}} consuls {{were given}} a six-month extension of their command as proconsuls to carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Samnium. Publius Decius ravaged Samnium until he drove the Samnite army outside its territory. This army went to Etruria to back up previous calls for an alliance, which had been turned down, with intimidation and insisted on the Etruscan council being convened. The Samnites pointed out {{that they could not}} defeat Rome by themselves, but an army of all the Etruscans, the richest nation in Italy, backed up by the Samnite army could. Meanwhile, Publius Decius decided to switch from ravaging the countryside to attacking cities as the Samnite army was away. He seized Murgantia, a strong city, and Romulea. After that he marched to Ferentium, which was in southern Etruria. Livy pointed out some discrepancies between his sources, noting that some annalists said that Romulea and Ferentium were taken by Quintus Fabius and that Publius Decius took only Murgantia, while others said that the towns were taken by the consuls of the year, and others still gave all the credit to Lucius Volumnius who, they said, had sole command in Samnium.|$|E
25|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt {{and his top}} military staff was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its {{invasion of}} Manchuria in 1931, and they had further worsened with Roosevelt's support of China in the Second Sino-Japanese War. With the war in Europe occupying {{the attention of the}} major colonial powers, Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and British Malaya. After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The pact bound each country to defend the other against attack, and Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers. Overcoming those who favored invading the Soviet Union, the Japanese Army high command successfully advocated for the conquest of Southeast Asia to ensure continued access to raw materials. In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply. He also placed the Philippine military under American command and recalled General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces on the Philippines.|$|E
