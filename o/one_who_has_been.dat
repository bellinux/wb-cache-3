5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{sentenced to death}} for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle {{to escape from the}} police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer is the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan {{is the one who}} is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
5|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for <b>one,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine {{had been involved in}} discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.|$|E

60|$|Reera did {{not keep}} them in misery {{more than a few}} seconds, for she touched each one with her right hand and {{instantly}} the fishes were transformed into three tall and slender young women, with fine, intelligent faces and clothed in handsome, clinging gowns. The <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a goldfish <b>had</b> beautiful golden hair and blue eyes and was exceedingly fair of skin; the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a bronzefish <b>had</b> dark brown hair and clear gray eyes and her complexion matched these lovely features. The <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a silverfish <b>had</b> snow-white hair of the finest texture and deep brown eyes. The hair contrasted exquisitely with her pink cheeks and ruby-red lips, nor did it make her look a day older than her two companions.|$|R
5|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II–era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for <b>one,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil, controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and travels to Hong Kong {{in pursuit of a}} middleman selling government secrets, who Mulder has also been pursuing. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) in Hong Kong, the oil passes itself to Krycek. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft.

25|$|And thirdly Ellen White {{addresses}} {{the combination of}} the message given in vision vs the way or style in which <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> given a vision chooses to convey that message. She appears to state this as a general principle applicable to all prophets whether they be Bible writers or not.|$|E

25|$|For those {{currently}} drawing Disney Duck comics, {{the influence}} of Barks cannot be overstated. For artists such as Daan Jippes and Freddy Milton, Barks' comics have made a great impact. Don Rosa, {{one of the most}} popular living Disney artists, and possibly the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology, considers (with few exceptions) all Barks' duck stories as canon, and all others as apocryphal. Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie-makers cite Carl Barks as their 'major influence and inspiration'.|$|E
500|$|Research has {{confirmed}} that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses, over {{time there is}} a limited improvement (termed [...] "blur adaptation") in their unaided visual resolution, even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in refractive error. This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the visual system. <b>One</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> practicing Bates' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off {{would have had the}} same effect, which may be especially pronounced if the prescription was too strong to begin with.|$|E
500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to me this morning with similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E
2500|$|A nominal participle {{indicates}} <b>one</b> <b>who</b> {{participates in}} the action specified by the verbal root. For example, esperinto is a [...] "hoper" [...] (past tense), or <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hoping.|$|R

500|$|The British Society for Parasitology {{was founded}} in the 1950s, largely due to Bishop's efforts. She was {{initially}} given only five pounds and a secretary to start the Society; to raise funds Bishop passed around a pudding basin at the Society's meetings. The society was originally a subgroup of the Institute of Biology at Cambridge, but it became an independent group in 1960 and was headed by Bishop. She {{was the president of}} the group, called the Institute of Biology Parasitology Group, from 1960 to 1962, the third overall leader of the group. Later that decade, the Department of Biology asked her to be the department head, but she declined because of the public nature of the role. For 20 years, the scientific journal Parasitology had Bishop on staff as an editor. Her lifelong association with Girton College prompted the placement of a plaque commemorating her life, whose inscription, quoted from Virgil, reads [...] "Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas", Latin for [...] "Happy is the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able {{to get to know the}} causes of things". In 1992, the British Society for Parasitology created a grant in Bishop's name, the Ann Bishop Travelling Award, to aid young parasitologists in travelling for field work where their parasites of interest are endemic.|$|E

2500|$|Max Jaeger. March's {{friend and}} Kripo partner, Jaeger is 50, {{lives with his}} wife Hannelore and four daughters in Berlin, and is disinclined to {{question}} 'the system'. At {{the end of the novel}} Jaeger drives the getaway car that rescues March, but it is revealed that he was the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> informing against March since before the novel began, and that March's [...] "rescue" [...] was arranged by the Gestapo as a ruse to find Charlotte Maguire.|$|E
2500|$|Samsara ends {{when one}} attains moksha, liberation. In early Buddhism, Nirvana, the [...] "blowing out" [...] of desire, is moksha. In later Buddhism insight becomes predominant, {{for example the}} {{recognition}} and acceptance of non-self, also called the anatta doctrine. One who no longer sees any soul or self, concludes Walpola Rahula, is the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> liberated from the samsara suffering cycles. The theme that Nirvana is non-Self, states Peter Harvey, is recurring in early Buddhist texts.|$|E
2500|$|The Christian {{understanding}} of apostasy is [...] "a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christian truth. Apostasy is {{the rejection of}} Christ by <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a Christian...", though many believe that biblically this is impossible ('once saved, forever saved'). [...] "Apostasy is the antonym of conversion; it is deconversion." [...] The Ancient Greek noun ἀποστασία apostasia ("rebellion, abandonment, state of apostasy, defection") is found only twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:3). However, [...] "the concept of apostasy is found throughout Scripture." [...] The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery states that [...] "There are at least four distinct images in Scripture {{of the concept of}} apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith." [...] These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, sir," [...] {{answered}} the chauffeur, while the gardener merely shrugged his shoulders. He {{was an old}} man and <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trusted by the Morrs for years.|$|R

2500|$|Subsequently, the {{committee}} appointed {{in the same}} year by the central government to study the utility of the existence of this law, reported in 1950 that the system violated the spirit of the Indian constitution. The Habitual Offenders Act (HOA) (1952) was enacted in the place of CTA; it states that a habitual offender is <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a victim of subjective and objective influences and has manifested a set practice in crime, and also presents a danger to society. The HOA effectively re-stigmatised the already marginalised [...] "criminal tribes". The previously criminalised tribes still suffer a stigma, because of the ineffective nature of the new Act, which in effect meant relisting of the supposed denotified tribes. Today the social category generally known as the denotified and nomadic tribes includes approximately 60 million people in India.|$|E
2500|$|The LDS Church is {{organized}} in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called [...] "the Prophet" [...] or President of the Church, as his spokesman on the earth. The current president is Thomas S. Monson. While {{there have been}} exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained apostles and form the First Presidency, the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most {{senior member of the}} Quorum of the Twelve (the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an apostle the longest), who reconstitutes a new First Presidency. These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two Quorums of Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric) are called general authorities. They exercise both ecclesiastical and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and mission presidents work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.|$|E
