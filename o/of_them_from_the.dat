A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany.

5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and {{was for a}} long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{fighting}} the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties, the bulk <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Second AIF. This included 11,323 killed in action, 1,794 died of wounds, and 21,853 wounded. 5,558 were killed or died in captivity, while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war. Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded/injured in operational areas, and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded/injured in non-operational areas. The large number of non-battle casualties was significant, illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E

5|$|The {{transfer}} of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It {{had been stripped}} of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of sports CCAs offered in HCI, ranging from soccer to ten-pin bowling, and from wushu to touch rugby. The canoeing, gymnastics, judo, shooting, table tennis and track & field teams garner {{nationwide}} achievements almost every year. HCI has won track & field championships in most divisions. The HCI track & field team used to hold and currently holds a few national records, particularly in pole vault. Other sports which have achieved significant results over the years include the basketball, canoeing, volleyball, water polo and wushu teams. For example, in 2010, the volleyball team, won the championships in both A divisions (Boys and Girls). Nine HCI students were selected to represent Singapore in the Youth Olympics Games 2010, two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> championship-winning basketball team.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May, Westmoreland visited FSB Coral and congratulated {{the task}} force on its defence. Both Australian battalions {{continued}} to patrol with minor contacts, and during one such incident at least six North Vietnamese were killed {{when a group of}} approximately 35 was engaged by artillery and armed helicopters after being observed by scouts from B Company, 3 RAR. During the week that followed Australian patrols clashed with groups of North Vietnamese moving through AO Surfers, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese 165th Regiment, which was believed to be withdrawing into War Zone D after attacking Tan Son Nhut airbase, near Saigon. A Company, 3 RAR subsequently occupied a blocking position on the Suoi Ba Pho creek, ambushing North Vietnamese moving northwards and directing mortar firing onto evasion routes, killing eight and capturing two. Elsewhere, C Company, 3 RAR located and destroyed a number of base camps in the vicinity of FSB Coogee. Meanwhile, with the approval of MacDonald, Hughes departed on a long-planned leave to Singapore on 18 May, and Colonel Donald Dunstan, {{the task force}} second-in-command, took over as Commander 1 ATF on 20 May. A respected and experienced leader, he quickly took control amidst growing tension.|$|E
