John Ostrander's comic Star Wars Republic 78: Loyalties (2005) chronicles how, shortly after seizing power, Emperor Palpatine sends Darth Vader to assassinate Sagoro Autem, an Imperial captain who plans to defect from the Empire. In Luceno's novel [...] (2005) (set shortly after Revenge of the Sith), the Emperor sends Darth Vader to the planet Murkhana to discover why clone troopers there refused to carry <b>out</b> <b>Order</b> 66 against their Jedi generals. Palpatine hopes these early missions will teach Vader {{what it means to be}} a Sith and crush any remnants of Anakin Skywalker.|$|E

50|$|From the consumer's {{point of}} view, there are {{potential}} advantages and disadvantages. The catalog showroom approach allows customers to shop {{without having to}} carry their purchases throughout the store as they shop. Possible downsides include that customers {{may be required to}} give their contact information when an order is placed, take the time to fill <b>out</b> <b>order</b> forms, and wait a period of time for their order to be available for purchase. This wait may be days long, one of the chief vulnerabilities of the catalog showroom approach.|$|E
50|$|Virtual queuing is {{a concept}} used in inbound call centers. Call centers use an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) to {{distribute}} incoming calls to specific resources (agents) in the center.

From the caller’s perspective, without virtual queuing they have only two choices: wait until an agent resource becomes available, or abandon (hang up) and try again later. From the call center’s perspective, a long queue results in many abandoned calls, repeat attempts, and customer dissatisfaction.|$|E

50|$|Normally {{these tactics}} are {{exercised}} {{in peace and}} cannot be essentially modified when war breaks <b>out.</b> <b>Order</b> of battle belongs more to tactics than strategy. Clausewitz {{also noted that the}} order of battle depends on the effective span of control by a commander. Too few subunits makes an army unwieldy; too many subunits makes the ‘power of the superior will’ weak; and in addition every step by which an order has to pass weakens its effect by loss of force and longer time of transmission. Clausewitz recommended that armies have no more than eight to ten subunits and subordinate corps four to six subunits.|$|E
