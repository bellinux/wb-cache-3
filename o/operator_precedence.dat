50|$|In {{computer}} science, an <b>operator</b> <b>precedence</b> parser is a bottom-up parser that interprets an operator-precedence grammar.

40|$|Although precedences {{are often}} used to resolve ambiguities in {{programming}} language descriptions, {{there has been no}} parser-independent definition of languages which are generated by grammars with precedence rules. This paper gives such a definition for a subclass of context-free grammars. A problem with a language containing infix, prefix and postfix <b>operators</b> of different <b>precedences</b> is that the well-known algorithm, which transforms a grammar with infix <b>operator</b> <b>precedences</b> to an ordinary unambiguous context-free grammar, does not work. This paper gives an algorithm that works also for prefix and postfix operators. An application of the algorithm is also presented. 1 Introduction Precedences are used in many language descriptions to resolve ambiguities. The reason for resolving ambiguities with precedences, instead of using an unambiguous grammar, is that the language description often becomes shorter and more readable.

40|$|Associative Language Descriptions are {{a recent}} grammar model, {{theoretically}} less powerful than Context Free grammars, but adequate for describing the syntax of programming languages. ALD {{do not use}} nonterminal symbols, but rely on permissible contexts for specifying valid syntax trees. In order to assess ALD adequacy, we analyze the descriptional complexity of structurally equivalent CF and ALD grammars, finding comparable measures. The compression obtained using CF copy rules is matched by context inheritance in ALD. The family of hierarchical parentheses languages, an abstract paradigm of HTML, and of expressions with <b>operator</b> <b>precedences</b> are studied in detail. A complete ALD grammar of Pascal is presented to testify of the practicality of the ALD approach.

50|$|An array value (or list) is {{specified}} by listing its elements, separated by commas, enclosed by parentheses (at least where required by <b>operator</b> <b>precedence).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is a table that lists the precedence and associativity of all the operators in the C and C++ languages (when the operators also exist in Java, Perl, PHP and many other recent languages, the precedence {{is the same as}} that given). Operators are listed top to bottom, in descending precedence. Descending precedence refers to the priority of the grouping of operators and operands. Considering an expression, an operator which is listed on some row will be grouped prior to any operator that is listed on a row further below it. Operators that are in the same cell (there may be several rows of operators listed in a cell) are grouped with the same precedence, in the given direction. An <b>operator's</b> <b>precedence</b> is unaffected by overloading.|$|R

50|$|Accordingly, it is {{not used}} in most languages, {{and it has been}} {{proposed}} for deprecation from D and Python. However, removing the feature breaks backwards compatibility, and replacing it with a concatenation operator introduces issues of precedence - string literal concatenation occurs during lexing, prior to operator evaluation, but concatenation via an explicit operator occurs {{at the same time as}} other <b>operators,</b> hence <b>precedence</b> is an issue, potentially requiring parentheses to ensure desired evaluation order.|$|R
