5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who were convinced that the battle was <b>over</b> <b>once</b> Fort 54 fell. The battle was far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E

She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take <b>over</b> <b>once</b> the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after the}} first year's worth of Oswalds, Walt Disney {{attempted}} to renew his contract with Winkler Pictures, but Charles Mintz, who had taken over Margaret Winkler's business after marrying her, wanted to force Disney to accept a lower advance payment for each Oswald short. Disney refused, and as Universal owned the rights to Oswald rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons. Most of Disney's staff was hired away by Mintz to move <b>over,</b> <b>once</b> Disney's Oswald contract was done in mid-1928.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them <b>over</b> <b>once</b> they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball <b>over</b> <b>once.</b> In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game <b>over.</b> <b>Once</b> the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

5|$|The race's {{fourth stage}} saw very rainy {{conditions}} throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the wrong turn onto Sabina rode for <b>over</b> , <b>once</b> {{they had reached}} Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined with the weather and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome {{for the start of}} the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di Lombardia, despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.|$|E

25|$|Law 20: Dead ball. The ball {{comes into}} play when the bowler begins his run up, and becomes dead when all the action from that ball is <b>over.</b> <b>Once</b> the ball is dead, no runs can be scored and no batsmen can be dismissed. The ball becomes dead {{for a number of}} reasons, most {{commonly}} when a batsman is dismissed, when a boundary is hit, or when the ball has finally settled with the bowler or wicketkeeper.|$|E

One {{of the best examples}} of this is the Monument to the Mexican Revolution. Originally the monument was to be the main dome of Diaz's new senate hall, but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed, this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many Mexicans that the Porfirian era was <b>over</b> <b>once</b> and for all and as such, it was turned into a monument to victory over Diaz.|$|E
25|$|Before {{embarking on}} a hunt, clans go through {{elaborate}} prehunt social rituals involving nuzzling, body rubbing and homo- and heterosexual mounting. Dholes are primarily diurnal hunters, hunting {{in the early hours}} of the morning. They rarely hunt nocturnally, except on moonlit nights, indicating they greatly rely on sight when hunting. Though not as fast as jackals and foxes, they can chase their prey for many hours. During a pursuit, one or more dholes may take over chasing their prey, while the rest of the pack keeps up at a steadier pace behind, taking <b>over</b> <b>once</b> the other group tires. Most chases are short, lasting only 500 m. When chasing fleet-footed prey, they run at a pace of 30mph. Dholes frequently drive their prey into water bodies, where the targeted animal's movements are hindered.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, the Bears {{faced the}} Indianapolis Colts for Super Bowl XLI rematch. Although the game {{took place during}} prime-time, they would treat the game {{as if it were}} any other preseason game. Regardless, the Bears won by a score of 27–24, but not without controversy. Grossman, making his homecoming to Indiana, struggled throughout the night. He fumbled the ball three times (though only turning it <b>over</b> <b>once),</b> and threw an interception. Despite completing the night by completing nine of eleven passes for fifty-nine yards and one rushing touchdown, Grossman's struggles became the focus of the night. Griese, however, threw ten completions on thirteen attempts with one touchdown. The Bears defense was able to record three interceptions, while the special teams unit was able to force a fumble on a return. Return specialists Devin Hester and Danieal Manning also performed productively as kick returners.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to avoid}} a repeat of their {{disastrous}} top flight campaign in 2000, Park started 2006 well with two wins in three but they soon capitulated when they suffered nine defeats in ten games {{to fall into the}} relegation zone. One of those losses came in an extraordinary game at Hyde which saw Park chalk up a mammoth 321-4. Shahid Mahmood was to score the quickest century in Cheshire County League history as he brought up his ton off just 29 balls. However all that hard work was extinguished as Hyde chased the total down to win by two wickets in the final <b>over.</b> <b>Once</b> again, Park could only last one season in the highest tier as they were relegated {{on the final day of}} the season. Foran stepped down as captain with Andrew Gibson stepping into the breach though the club suffered the blow of losing key players like Mahmood and Chris Stenhouse.|$|E
25|$|Pickering Parish Church is at {{the eastern}} end of the Market Place and dominates views of Pickering from all directions. It is a Grade I Listed {{building}} that dates from the 12th century. It is notable for its mid-15th-century wall paintings, which cover the north and south walls. The wall paintings were covered over at the Reformation, but rediscovered in 1852. They were painted <b>over</b> <b>once</b> more, but were restored in the 1870s. The church is open every day. North of the church {{at the top of the}} hill is Pickering Castle, which was built in the late 11th century to defend the area against the Scots and Danes. The sloping Market Place between the church and the beck is lined with two- and three-storey buildings dating from a variety of periods. Most are listed for their historical or architectural interest. This area is the centre of the town's main Conservation Area.|$|E
25|$|Bowling, in cricket, is {{the action}} of {{propelling}} the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler {{who is also a}} competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an <b>over.</b> <b>Once</b> a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over {{from the other end of}} the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a no ball. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a wide.|$|E

If rain intervenes so that all the allocated overs cannot be bowled in the time available for the game, the overs restriction may be modified so that the game may be completed in the time that remains.|$|R
