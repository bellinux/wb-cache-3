25|$|Tithes are broken-off {{during the}} Sabbatical year (such {{as when the}} ground lies fallow), during which year, all fruits, grains and {{vegetables}} that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and <b>ownerless</b> <b>property.</b> For example, whatever lands were held by those returning from the Babylonian exile {{at the time of}} Ezra are forbidden to be ploughed and sown by any Jew during the Seventh year, and even if gentiles were to plough such land and sow it, the produce would be forbidden unto Jews to eat. On the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the Land of Canaan under their leader, Joshua, are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. If on a regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.|$|E
5000|$|The term can be {{contrasted with}} res nullius, {{the concept of}} <b>ownerless</b> <b>property,</b> {{associated}} for example with terra nullius, the concept of unowned territory by which British settlement in Australia was arguably based, despite being home to indigenous peoples.|$|E
50|$|In England (with the {{exception}} of Lancashire, Manchester and Cornwall), the Treasury Solicitor is the Crown's nominee for the collection and disposition of <b>ownerless</b> <b>property</b> (bona vacantia). This typically comprises the assets of dissolved companies and the estates of persons who die intestate and with no known kin.|$|E
5000|$|A waif was {{an item of}} <b>ownerless</b> and {{unclaimed}} <b>property</b> {{found on}} a landowner's territory, while a stray referred to a domestic animal that had wandered onto the same land. Both terms originated from Anglo-Norman French. A grant of waif and stray permitted the landowner to take ownership of such goods or animals if they remained unclaimed after a set period of time.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} United States asset restitution policy {{agreed upon}} at the 1946 Final Act of Paris Reparation Conference {{and by the}} Five-Power Agreement for Non-Repatriable Victims of Germany was to sell <b>ownerless</b> <b>property</b> {{for the benefit of}} non-repatriable refugees. These agreements were the basis for the creation of the Preparatory Committee for the International Refugee Organization (IRO).|$|E
50|$|Res nullius (lit: nobody's thing) (also: Derelictio and Res derelictae is a Latin term {{derived from}} private Roman law whereby res (an {{object in the}} legal sense, {{anything}} that can be owned, even a slave, but not a subject in law such as a citizen nor land) is not yet the object of rights of any specific subject. Such items are considered <b>ownerless</b> <b>property</b> and are free to be acquired by means of occupatio. Examples of res nullius in the socio-economic sphere are wild animals (ferae naturae) or abandoned property (res derelictae). Finding can also be a means of occupation (i.e. vesting ownership), since a thing completely lost or abandoned is res nullius, and therefore belonged to the first taker. Specific legislation may be made, e.g. for beachcombing.|$|E

50|$|Both the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster — since 1399 held by {{the monarch}} in a {{personal}} capacity—have special legal rights not available to other landed estates: for example, the rules on bona vacantia, the right to <b>ownerless</b> <b>property,</b> operate in favour of the holders of the duchies rather than the Crown, such that the property of anyone who dies in the county of Cornwall without a will or identifiable heirs, and assets belonging to dissolved companies whose registered office was in Cornwall, pass to the duchy. In 2007, £130,000 was realised from the right of bona vacantia, and given to a charitable fund. The duke owns freehold about three-fifths of the Cornish foreshore and the 'fundus', or bed, of navigable rivers and has right of wreck on all ships wrecked on Cornish shores, including those afloat offshore, and also to royal fish - i.e. whales, porpoises, and sturgeon. The Duchy of Cornwall is the Harbour Authority for St Mary's Harbour. There are separate attorneys-general for the duchies. The High Sheriff of Cornwall is appointed by the Duke of Cornwall, not the monarch, {{in contrast to the}} other counties of England and Wales. The duke had a ceremonial role in summoning the Cornish Stannary Parliament.|$|E
40|$|The {{trust of}} the new Civil Code of Quebec of 1994 relies on the {{innovative}} juridical framework of "patrimony by appropriation". The present thesis analyzes the new trust and situates it within a broader perspective through comparisons with the Common law trust and {{an examination of the}} alternative approaches to fiduciary institutions in Civil law jurisdictions. The notion of patrimony by appropriation implies that the corpus of the Quebec trust constitutes <b>ownerless</b> <b>property.</b> Despite its novelty, we find that the concept is compatible with the civilian theories of droit subjectif and patrimony, {{as well as with the}} other parts of the new Code. The Quebec solution is also able to emulate most of the Common law trust's functional advantages, namely its versatility and flexibility, efficient management and protection of the beneficial enjoyment. Close attention is given to the intricate analysis of the beneficiary's legal position. The examination of alternatives to the Quebec approach reveals that several theoratical constructions may be complemented by specific provisions furnishing the necessary functional advantages. It is precisely these accompanying features which will largely determine the success of a general fiduciary institution adopted in Civil law countries. Since the new Quebec trust is endowed with both a satisfactory conceptual framework and an advantageous juridical regime, it should be considered as an interesting model by jurisdictions attempting to introduce a modern trust-like device...|$|E
