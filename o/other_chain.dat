25|$|From {{the start}} of March 2008, rumors that Obama was born in Kenya before being flown to Hawaii were spread on {{conservative}} websites, with the suggestion that this would disqualify Obama from the presidency. In April of that year, anonymous e-mails from supporters of Hillary Clinton repeated the same rumor, including a Clinton Iowa campaign worker, who was fired for sending the e-mail.

25|$|Traditional fixed {{markets in}} the city have been {{steadily}} losing their client base. One {{reason for this is}} that many have moved out of inner cities where these markets are into the suburbs. Over fifty percent of those who do shop at these markets are over the age of thirty five, with younger and more affluent shoppers preferring supermarkets, which are generally cleaner and better maintained. Markets that have had supermarkets or <b>other</b> <b>chain</b> stores open nearby have seen salves drop as much as fifty percent. This has led to the abandonment of many fixed market stalls and about twenty percent of these {{markets in the}} Mexico City area have been abandoned altogether. Although still important, the percentage of foodstuffs sold through basic markets has declined to only about twenty percent in Mexico City. Of the 317 markets, 248 offer fresh produce. Many stands have been replaced by those selling prepared foods such as tortas, juices, unlicensed movies and music, and other items.|$|E

60|$|Peters {{had left}} {{one of the}} chains in the passage, and I found, upon {{plunging}} in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down. I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely to recover the <b>other</b> <b>chain.</b> In groping along {{the floor of the}} passage for this, I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of port wine. Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken.|$|E
