5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Another view is {{that until}} the Upper Paleolithic, humans were frugivores (fruit eaters) who {{supplemented}} their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and mussels, and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as antelopes. This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically, sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally {{very similar to that}} of humans. Chimpanzees are primarily frugivores, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant-based, with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals. In some ecosystems, however, chimpanzees are predatory, forming parties to hunt monkeys. Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sources such as animal foods, allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead.|$|E
500|$|To address {{concerns}} over the increase in childhood obesity in Western nations and accusations of unhealthy offerings for children by {{groups such as the}} Center for Science in the Public Interest, the company created a nutritional program called [...] "BK Positive Steps" [...] that is aimed at children and their families. The program began with the introduction of products such as broiled Chicken Tenders, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and apple [...] "fries", which are French cut apples served in a fry box that are featured in a new low-fat Kid's Club Meal. According to a statement by Burger King, the new Kid's Club meals contain no more than 560 calories per meal, less than 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat, less than 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fat, no added trans fats, and no more than 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> added sugars. Additional changes to its menu were announced in May 2009, including the reduction of sodium levels in its Chicken Tenders product by approximately 33 percent; a switch to non-fat milk products in the U.S.; and adding calcium-fortified apple juice to its beverage line-up. The broiled Chicken Tenders product is only sold in the UK/Ireland market. The product line has been expanded to include a boiled mini chicken sandwich for the kid's meals in this region.|$|E

500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch." [...] It found that [...] "...the calories eaten at lunch were not affected by whether the snack was cookies or cola." ...|$|E

Increased consumption of added sugars, which are sweeteners added to processed and prepared foods, has been linked to a decrease in intake of essential micronutrients (1, 2) and an increase in body weight (3). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends limiting total intake <b>of</b> discretionary <b>calories,</b> including both added sugars and solid fats, to 5 %– 15 % per day (4). Recent analyses indicate that children and adolescents obtain approximately 16 % of their total caloric intake from added sugars (5).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{describe}} {{diet and}} exercise practices from a nationally representative sam-ple of U. S. adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS — We analyzed data from 1, 480 adults older than 17 years with a self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Fruit and vegetable consumption was obtained from a food frequency question-naire; the percentages <b>of</b> total <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and saturated fat were obtained from a 24 -h food recall.

RESULTS — Of individuals with type 2 diabetes, 31 % reported no regular physical activity and another 38 % reported less than recommended levels of physical activity. Sixty-two percent of respondents ate fewer than five servings {{of fruits and vegetables}} per day. Almost two thirds of the respondents consumed 30 % <b>of</b> their daily <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and 10 % <b>of</b> total <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fat.
