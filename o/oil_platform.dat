5|$|Arlene {{passed over}} several {{offshore}} oil platforms as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, producing gusty winds. The strongest surface wind gust reported {{in association with}} Arlene was clocked at 63mph (101km/h) on an <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> south of Sabine Pass, Texas. Four other oil platforms experienced gusts or sustained winds of at least gale force.|$|E

50|$|Aquatic organisms {{invariably}} attach {{themselves to}} the undersea portions of <b>oil</b> <b>platforms,</b> turning them into artificial reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California, the waters around <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen, because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms. The United States and Brunei have active Rigs-to-Reefs programs, in which former <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> are left in the sea, either in place or towed to new locations, as permanent artificial reefs. In the US Gulf of Mexico, as of September 2012, 420 former <b>oil</b> <b>platforms,</b> about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs.|$|R

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the <b>oil</b> <b>platform,</b> which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen.

50|$|Over 40 million seabirds are {{negatively}} affected by <b>oil</b> <b>platforms.</b> Seabirds tend to aggregate around oil rigs, attracted by artificial lighting, flares, {{food and other}} visual cues. Seabirds often collide directly with <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> or circle around oil rigs and flares for days, eventually dying of starvation. Birds such as storm petrels, dovekies and shearwaters migrate across the Grand Banks and hydrocarbon development near the <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> significantly decreases the populations of these birds.|$|R

5|$|Late on November8, Ida {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm. Only {{a small area}} of convection remained near the center by the morning of November9. Despite the strong shear, the storm quickly re-organized, attaining hurricane status {{for a third time}} during the afternoon. Based on readings from a nearby <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> and reconnaissance data, it was determined that Ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of Louisiana with winds of 85mph (140km/h). However, this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that he is}} {{lifting the}} {{quarantine}} of the <b>oil</b> <b>platform.</b> Scully opposes the idea but she has no choice other than to obey. Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters {{for most of}} its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00UTC on October1. Winds were recorded up to 47knots (54mph; 87km/h). Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe. There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October5, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously saturated soil, combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions. One person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings {{as a result of the}} rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>oil</b> <b>platform,</b> Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent <b>oil</b> <b>platform,</b> causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, {{airports}} and ports were closed, while regularly scheduled bus routes were canceled. About 180locations {{were prepared to}} serve as a shelter if large scale evacuations were necessary. In Punta Allen and Punta Herrero, authorities ordered the evacuation of about 100families. Dozens of oil and gas wells in the Bay of Campeche owned by Pemex were evacuated, while Shell Oil Company evacuated some people from an <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> farther north. Approximately 6,500people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Tampico and flood prone locations in San Luis Potosi. The General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport closed {{for most of the day}} on August23. A total of 37ports along the Gulf Coast of Mexico were closed. In Texas, Cameron County officials purchased satellite telephones and generators and released 55prisoners because of fear that the newly built jail might not withstand a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Chris returns to {{duty in the}} BSAA with Piers and a new team, {{arriving}} in Lanshiang under {{the threat of a}} bio-terrorist attack. Chris recovers from his amnesia and seeks revenge against Ada, resulting in casualties for his squad. Chris and Piers confront Ada, until Leon intervenes. After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue Ada to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry, and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's medical data to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to keep him from disclosing the truth behind Raccoon City, which he believes would have led to the US losing its authority. The two temporarily defeat a mutated Simmons while Sherry and Jake are captured once again. While attempting to leave the city, Leon and Helena are warned by Chris that a missile has been launched, however they are too late to stop it. Leon discloses Jake's real identity to Chris and has him rescue Jake and Sherry in a remote <b>oil</b> <b>platform.</b> With the assistance of Ada, Leon and Helena finally kill Simmons.|$|E
