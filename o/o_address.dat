40|$|SUMMARY: Management of the {{arterial}} road infrastructure bridges in NSW is {{a component of}} the overall road network infrastructure management undertaken by the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). The RTA’s bridge inventory has been constructed over more than 100 years and as such there are many emerging issues regarding bridge management. The RTA recognises the importance of managing bridges and their load carrying capacity, to ensure overall network connectivity and level of service to road users. Many older bridges require replacement or significant upgrading to meet current dimensions and loading guidelines. Often these older bridges are of heritage significance. As a committed and competent bridge owner and manager, the RTA continues to proactively manage its bridge stock by: o understanding issues related to the relevant design era, o identifying and responding to changes in condition of bridge elements through a systematic and structured inspection, condition assessment and structural capability assessment regime, <b>o</b> <b>addressing</b> emerging bridge issues, o investing in new technologies, and o implementing innovative solutions in the management of its heritage bridge stock.

These surveys have provided adata set which provides aunique opportunity <b>o</b> <b>address</b> the relationship between the incidence and location of hydrothermal venting relative to volcanism/tectonism and ridge segmentation. Along the Reykjanes Ridge, running SW from Iceland, deep-tow (TOBI) sidescan sonar and swath bathymetry data have indicated a pattern dominated by volcanism in the form of axial volcanic ridges with only minor tectonic fracturing. A water column survey along this section of ridge crest, using conventional profiling techniques, indicated no evidence for high-temperature hydrothermal actvity except at 63 ~ where the Reykjanes Ridge intercepts the bathymetric platform (-< 500 m water depth) which surrounds Iceland. Along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 36 - 38 ~ running SW from the Azores archipelago, TOBI and swath bathymetry data have imaged aridge with spreading rate and obliquity of spreading motion similar to the Reykjanes Ridge.

Optimization of amplification of viral genome Was performed With three primer pairs derived from gag, env, and pol sequences. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were analyzed by Southern blot. Viral genome was found in five of 11 HIV-seropositive patients. To control the permissivity of epidermal cell population for HIV, cells isolated from the epidermal sheet of normal skin by trypsinization were co-cultured with HIV- 1 -carrying promonocytic cells (U 937) and observed by electron microscopy. After 3 – 6 h of co-culture, numerous virions were either tightly bound or apparently engaed in the process of internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis. At day 4 of co-culture, some infected LC appeared to release mature viral particles through bud formation.

40|$|Workers in highway work {{zones are}} exposed to risk of injury from the {{movement}} of construction vehicles and equipment within the work zones, {{as well as from}} passing motor vehicle traffic. Data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) indicate that of the 841 work-related fatalities in the U. S. highway construction industry between 1992 and 1998, 465 (55 %) were vehicle- or equipment-related incidents that occurred in a work zone. Highway workers routinely work in proximity to construction vehicles and motor vehicle traffic. Flaggers and other workers on foot {{are exposed to}} the risk of being struck by traffic vehicles or construction equipment if they are not visible to motorists or equipment operators. Workers who operate construction vehicles or equipment risk injury due to overturn, collision, or being caught in running equipment. Highway workers, regardless of their assigned task, work in conditions of low lighting, low visibility, and inclement weather, and may work in congested areas with exposure to high traffic volume and speeds. The Federal Highway Administration has developed and maintained the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which provides for uniform design and setup of highway work zones. The primary focus of Part 6 of the MUTCD is the interaction between the road user and the work zone. The MUTCD contains exhaustive specifications for signage, pavement and curb markings, traffic signals, and marking of school zones, bicycle facilities, and highway-rail crossings. It also prescribes temporary traffic control measures for numerous scenarios involving lane closures, lane shifts, detours, shoulder work, median crossovers, mobile operations, and blasting. The MUTCD addresses topics such as training, personal protective equipment, speed reduction, barriers, and lighting, as they apply to highway construction. OSHA construction industry regulations (29 CFR 1926, Subpart <b>O)</b> <b>address</b> operation of vehicles and equipment within an off-highway job site not open to public traffic. However, Subpart O is not exhaustive in its coverage of machinery types or safety equipment, nor does it address work practices, traffic control plans, or shift work. Flagging and signaling practices are discussed in general terms in Subpart G, which covers signs, signals, and barricades. Subpart G defers to the 1971 MUTCD on matters relating to hand signals, barricades, and traffic control devices. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Also available via the World Wide Web.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{demonstrates the}} various steps involved when {{setting up an}} institutional repository within a South African context. The paper was presented during the "Ninth Southern African Online Information Meeting", 3 – 5 June 2008, held at the CSIR Conference Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. World-wide the paradigm is to make research collections available online, thereby improving access to information that is of great value for research. Since the facilitation of access to information (for research as well as e-research purposes) is a primary function of academic or research libraries, libraries can take the initiative to implement a digital research repository in order to manage, organize, preserve, distribute and offer access to research conducted {{by the members of}} that institution. If an institution supports open access, wants to increase the usage and visibility of research conducted at that institution and wants to preserve all research output digitally, an institutional repository is the answer. This paper will address the process of implementing an institutional repository successfully. The focus will be specifically on African and South African institutions (incl. libraries), that need support and guidance to do so. The Institutional Repository Toolbox will be demonstrated, a tool that was specifically developed keeping the needs of African and South African institutions in mind. The Toolbox offers guidance on the following: o	Conducting a needs analysis o	Compiling a proposal & business plan o	Evaluating available IR software <b>o</b>	<b>Addressing</b> design & development issues o	Implementing stage, and the evaluation processes o	Marketing and promoting the institutional repository o	Registering the institutional repository with harvesters et al., and making it more visible. Through sharing the above, others can also become part of this very dynamic community. In the end not only will librarians be able to expand on their existing skills and library roles, but researchers and institutions will also benefit – due to higher visibility and usage – since their research will have a greater impact on the world out there.
