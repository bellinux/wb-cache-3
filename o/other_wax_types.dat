50|$|He {{was born}} Martin Gustafsson, but changed his surname to Matsbo in 1928 after the village where he lived. He was a non-commissioned {{military}} officer, and in 1941 {{participated in the}} War World Championships in Cortina d'Ampezzo. For {{more than three decades}} Matsbo was working on new ski wax formulations. He developed a ski wax {{that was one of the}} most used in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1942 his wax boiler in Malung burned down, destroying many of his recipes and ongoing experiments, and to continue his work he joined the Astra company. Here, he developed Swix, one of the first synthetic waxes, which became commercial in 1946, and was used at the 1948 Olympics. Matsbo later produced <b>other</b> <b>wax</b> <b>types</b> for ski jumping and alpine skiing. He was featured in the 1988 documentary film De sista skidåkarna (The Last Skiers). On his 90th birthday in 2001, he received the Peder Smith Medal, the highest award of his hometown Hedemora. The Matsboloppet, a national cross-country race in Hedemora, is named after him.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of <b>wax</b> <b>types</b> used in the lost wax casting process. Generally they fall into three main types, soft, hard and {{injection}} waxes. Injection waxes are made and intended to be used for injecting wax under pressure into rubber or other types of molds. They can be carved and worked otherwise, but they are not specifically designed for that use. Their properties more often target good injection properties: flow, low shrinkage, pot life etc.|$|R
50|$|It {{is mostly}} used mixed with <b>other</b> <b>waxes</b> to harden them without raising their melting point. As a food additive, {{candelilla}} wax has the E number E 902 {{and is used}} as a glazing agent. It also finds use in cosmetic industry, as a component of lip balms and lotion bars. One of its major uses is as a binder for chewing gums.|$|R

It is also high in paraffin and <b>other</b> <b>waxes</b> making it highly desirable for refinement into petroleum lubricants such as motor oil. Its products are also valuable for use in certain hydraulic applications. By-products are commonly found in consumer goods such as cosmetics, and topical ointments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{technology has been}} shown to be more accurate in measuring indi-vidual incisor tooth widths than the use of wax exemplars. There were fewer differences by investigators using CBCT than others using an F-test in a mixed model of the measurement differences of investi-gators, <b>wax</b> <b>type,</b> and which tooth was measured. In addition, the frequency of outliers was less in the CBCT method (a total of 5) as compared to the two-dimensional measurements in ether Aluwax (a total of 8) or Coprwax (a total of 12). Both results indicate that CBCT measurements accounted more precisely for tooth width and level of eruption...|$|R

5000|$|Candle-making {{has long}} {{involved}} {{the use of}} beeswax, which is highly flammable, and this material traditionally was prescribed for {{the making of the}} Paschal candle or [...] "Easter candle". This may be because beeswax candles are often purported to be superior to <b>other</b> <b>wax</b> candles, because they are meant to burn brighter and longer, do not bend, and burn [...] "cleaner". It is further recommended for the making of other candles used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church. [...] Beeswax is also the candle constituent of choice in the Orthodox Church.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} {{constituents of}} cephalic secrections of 11 Brazilian social stingless bee {{species of the}} Tetragonisca - Tetragona line have been analysed. By gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 145 compounds could be identified which include 72 esters, 22 alcohols, 16 carboxylic acids, 13 terpenoids, 8 aldehydes, 7 ketones, 4 aromatic compounds, 2 lactones and 1 dihydropyran. Structural relations, origin, and distribution of these compounds are discussed. With respect to qualitative and quantitative composition, each species shows a specific odour pattern which is made up by less specific components. To a certain extent, closely related species show some similarities in the odour bouquets.

50|$|A {{variety of}} dental flosses are {{commonly}} available. Floss {{is available in}} many forms including waxed, unwaxed monofilaments and multifilaments. Dental floss that is made of monofilaments coated in wax slides easily between teeth, does not fray and is generally higher in cost than its uncoated counterparts. The most important difference between available dental flosses is thickness. Waxed and unwaxed floss are available in varying widths. Studies have shown {{that there is no}} difference in the effectiveness of waxed and unwaxed dental floss, but some <b>waxed</b> <b>types</b> of dental floss are said to contain antibacterial agents and/or sodium fluoride. Factors to consider in choosing a floss include the amount of space between teeth and user preference. Dental tape is a type of floss product which is wider and flatter than conventional floss. Dental tape is recommended for people with larger tooth surface area.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the leaf anatomy of Cordiera sessilis (Rubiaceae), a native {{medicinal}} shrub from Brazilian Cerrado was carried out to contribute for species identification and provide support for future biochemical studies and medicinal application. Leaves were collected, fixed and processed by usual techniques, and studied by light and electron microscopy. Quantitative analyzes of stomata and trichomes were performed. The leaves showed typical characteristics of Rubiaceae family, like hypostomatic leaves, paracytic stomata, dorsiventral mesophyll and collateral bundles. Two types of vascular patterns were identified in the petiole: in distal part, the vascular system is arranged cylindrically surrounded by sclerenchyma sheath and in proximal part, the vascular system is arranged in U-shape coupled to sclerified cells. The micromorphological organization of leaf surface, epicuticular <b>wax</b> <b>types,</b> the petiole pattern and histochemical characteristics {{as the presence of}} druses, sand crystals and alkaloids and absence of raphids in the mesophyll, midrib and petiole are considerate representative characteristics of C. sessilis and may be useful in the species identification.

50|$|After Degas' death, his heirs (brother and sister's children) {{made the}} {{decision}} to have the bronze repetitions of Le Petite Danseuse and <b>other</b> <b>wax</b> and mixed-media sculptures cast. The casting took place at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until 1936 when the Hébrard foundry went bankrupt and closed. Thereafter, “Hébrard” Degas Little Dancer bronzes were cast at the Valsuani foundry in Paris until the mid-1970s. Sixty-nine of Degas' wax sculptures survived the casting process. One copy of Le Petite Danseuse is currently owned by the creator and owner of Auto Trader, John Madejski. He stated that he bought the sculpture by accident. That copy was sold for £13,257,250 ($19,077,250) at Sotheby's on February, 3rd 2009. Another Hébrard Little Dancer bronze failed to sell at a November 2011 auction at Christie's.|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the generic}} delimitations within Aeridinae {{has been a}} {{significant}} issue in the taxonomy of Orchidaceae, and Holcoglossum is a typical case. We investigated the phylogenetic utility of the morphological traits of leaf epidermis in the taxonomy of Holcoglossum s. l. by using light and scanning electron microscopy to analyze 38 samples representing 12 species of Holcoglossum, with five species from five closely related genera, such as Ascocentrum, Luisia, Papilionanthe, Rhynchostylis and Vanda. Our results indicated that Holcoglossum can be distinguished from the related genera based on cuticular wax characteristics, and the inclusion of Holcoglossum himalaicum in Holcoglossum is supported by the epidermis characteristics found by LM and SEM. The percentage of the tetracytic, brachyparacytic, and laterocytic stomata types as well as the stomata index and certain combinations of special <b>wax</b> <b>types</b> support infrageneric clades and phylogenetic relationships that have been inferred from molecular data. Laterocytic and polarcytic stomata are perhaps ecological adaptations to the strong winds and ample rains in the alpine region of the Hengduanshan Mountains...|$|R
