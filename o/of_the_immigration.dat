5|$|In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Voice forum, {{initiated}} a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Over a three-day period, hundreds of flower bouquets {{were sent to}} the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office by Indians who were legally in the US but caught in a green card backlog. On 17 July, the USCIS reversed the decision that led to the protest.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, Srinivasa Sastri {{successfully}} pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and boards to cancel registration certificates. Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
