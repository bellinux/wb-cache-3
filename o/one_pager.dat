5000|$|This revival {{was further}} aided by guitarist and founder Sal Canzonieri's strong {{use of the}} {{internet}} early on to promote the band's music. Electric Frankenstein is considered the first band to have had a website, albeit a <b>one</b> <b>pager</b> back in 1991. Also, he strongly promoted all bands of the new Punk Rock & Roll genre in the newly emerging MP3 digital format, on the highly popular music site MP3.com, helping to develop a strong community of bands from many states in the USA and from many countries. Canzonieri later created the critically acclaimed series of compilations called [...] "A Fistful of Rock & Roll", which collected and highlighted all of the best of the new rock bands, collectively known as the New Rock Revolution. There have been 13 volumes of the series so far, published on various record labels (Tee Pee Records, Victory Records, and Steel Cage Records). A second series is forthcoming, known as [...] "A Fistful More of Rock & Roll".|$|E

The purchasing power parities the Bank uses to convert its IPL into other currencies at best preserve purchasing power equivalence relative to the pattern of international household consumption.

This note seeks {{to show that the}} debate on ‘Pro-Poor Growth ’ is sterile and largely academic with few policy insights for the following reasons: 1. To begin with, it is essentially a debate on ex post characterization of a growth process with reference to distributional outcomes as reflected in estimates of income or consumer expenditure distribution. The final shape and location of distribution of such outcome measures would be determined by factors, many of which are beyond the control of a policy maker.

The truth is more like this: economies with more equal income distribution are likely to achieve higher rates of poverty reduction than very unequal countries.

40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa’s {{long-term}} development, including {{attainment of}} the MDGs and continued progress beyond 2015, depends on mobilizing domestic financial resources and channeling them to productive {{private and public}} investment.

This <b>One</b> <b>Pager</b> evaluates the outcomes by examining the experience of 19 countries that have liberalized (see Serieux 2008).

The workload is disproportionately carried by women, while children enter the labour force prematurely and the elderly work beyond retirement. According to economic theories, individuals consume a constant percentage of the present value of their lifetime income, which is based on their forward-looking expectations. Savings are made during the economically productive period, and dissaving happens during childhood and retirement. Low-income individuals have a high average propensity to consume.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of policies in developing countries seek to empower women through female entrepreneurship. Many microfinance institutions (MFIs), for example, lend exclusively to women. Loans are usually combined with capacity building workshops on entrepreneurial activities such as the production of handicrafts, clothes or food to be sold in local markets. While {{there is evidence that}} these strategies have been successful in empowering women (Panjaitan-Drioadisuryo and Cloud, 1999), less is known about how such an increase in mothers ’ nondomestic labour affects the working hours of their children.

This <b>One</b> <b>Pager</b> seeks to contribute to the debate on aid by presenting results from a traditional fiscal response model estimated for Ethiopia. The model focuses on the impact of foreign aid on government expenditure, revenue and domestic borrowing.

The process has been protracted, reforms have been difficult to implement and the private sector has failed to respond. Meanwhile, public investment has stalled; this is the main cause of the current crisis. The focus of reform was on bringing market forces to bear on the electricity supply industry. Eskom, the state utility, was corporatised and in 2001, its core activities (the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity) were separated, with their finances ring-fenced...|$|E
40|$|For {{developing}} economies {{the current}} crisis means reduced demand for their exports, a decline in capital inflows and lower income from tourism. This <b>One</b> <b>Pager</b> discusses the transmission of the crisis from changes in aggregate variables to its impact on progress towards human development. The focus is on African economies. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2008 the volume of world trade declined by 3. 9 per cent over the figure for 2007. It is forecast to decline by a further 7. 7 per cent in 2009. This fall in demand entails {{a cost of about}} US$ 251 billion to African economies. The loss comes from drops in commodity prices. Between April and December 2008, the price of beverages and food fell by 24 per cent. Prices for minerals, ores and metals dropped by 51 per cent. Prices of vegetable oil seeds fell by 47 per cent.

But how and whom does goal setting influence? Goals are set without control over the means of implementation. In an IPC-IG Working Paper, I use ideas from the Sociology of Numbers on ‘indicators as a technology of governance ’ (Merry, 2009) to explore the mechanisms by which global goals create incentives for action and frame thinking, thereby exerting both intended and unintended influence on policy agendas.
