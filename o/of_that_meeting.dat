5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>meeting</b> are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, the {{political}} energies {{of the newly}} independent states were focused on forming “a more perfect union,” first in the Articles of Confederation, later in the Constitution of the United States of America. The newly independent daughter churches of the Church of England also sought “a more perfect union,” and foremost in the leadership was the same Abraham Beach. In the winter of 1783/84 he corresponded with William White (later the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church) and other clergy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York soliciting a gathering to “consider {{the state of the}} church.” He extended an invitation to meet at Christ Church May 11, 1784. The outgrowth <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>meeting</b> was a call for another meeting in October 1784 with representatives from all thirteen states to consider a general convention to manage the affairs of the newly independent church. The First General Convention met in September 1785, leading to the current shape of the church we now know: with equal voice and vote for bishops, clergy and laity, the beginnings of an American Book of Common Prayer, and our own national Constitution and Canons.|$|E
25|$|After being {{directed}} by the Báb to return to Khorasan, Mullá Husayn continued spreading Babism in Mashhad and throughout the province. During his time in Mashhad, a rebellion against {{the government of the}} Shah broke out in Khorasan, involving an alliance between local Kurdish tribes and the sheriff of Mashhad. Mullá Husayn learned that the leader of the rebellion hoped to secure his support {{as a representative of the}} growing Babi community, and decided on leaving Mashhad to avoid entangling the local Bábís in the chaos expected to result when the forces of the Shah eventually arrived. About the same time news arrived that the Bab had been arrested and imprisoned in the mountain fortress of Maku near the Turkish border, following the increased controversy surrounding the Báb who was sent from Shiraz to Isfahan and then being ordered to Tehran by the Shah. In early 1848 Mullá Husayn embarked on foot from Mashhad—on the eastern edge of Persia–to Tehran, with the intention of continuing on to Maku—located in the far northwest. On his journey he was solely accompanied by a Bábí servant named Qambar-Ali. In Tehran he was received by Mírzá Músá, half brother to Bahá'u'lláh, and a group of local Bábís and met briefly with Bahá'u'lláh in a private interview. No known record <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>meeting</b> survives.|$|E

After several {{declined}} the position, he {{offered it to}} Fuller, referring to her as [...] "my vivacious friend." [...] Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>meeting,</b> he admitted [...] "she made me laugh more than I liked." [...] The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit The Dial on October 20, 1839, and began work {{in the first week}} of 1840. She edited the journal for its first two years from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called Summer on the Lakes, which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it [...] "the only genuine book, I can think of, this season." [...] Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.|$|E

However, on 4 May 2017, after no team had been named, the committee of administrators told the BCCI to select their squad immediately.

2500|$|Despite {{his success}} at {{changing}} the failing studio around, rumors began to circulate in early 1937 that Rogers might be replaced at Universal. In May 1937 Universal's chairman, J.

In September the Universal Board of Directors issued a resolution in support of the studio's management, including Rogers. November 1937 brought the revelation that Rogers had been attempting to secure additional financing for the studio. This was accomplished by replacing studio president Cochrane with Nate J. Blumberg, who had been vice-president in charge of RKO theater operations. As part of the management shake-up, Rogers remained in charge of production. With Blumberg's arrival in January 1938, things began to change at the studio. [...] During the course of meetings during the spring, Rogers began to feel his control over the production end of the studio was being undermined. In May, he requested a special meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss his authority over the production process. As a result <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>meeting,</b> Rogers was relieved of his duties as a Universal executive, approximately two years after assuming the position.|$|E
