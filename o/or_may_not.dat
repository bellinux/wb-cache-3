5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli which may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids").

Their elongated bodies may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, {{has led to the}} common name praying mantis.|$|E
