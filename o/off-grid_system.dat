50|$|This section {{includes}} {{systems that}} are either highly specialized and uncommon or still an emerging new technology with limited significance. However, standalone or <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> take a special place.

Only in places where no electrical grid was available, they were economically viable. Although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world, their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing. In Europe, <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> account for 1 percent of installed capacity.

40|$|The {{development}} of autonomous energy systems {{has been accompanied}} by a number of challenges related to the specific characteristics of these systems, such as power flow control, {{development of}} protection systems respecting the dynamic changes in short-circuit power and the issue of compliance with power quality parameters. To keep the power quality parameters of electrical energy in <b>Off-Grid</b> <b>systems</b> within the limit is highly complicated with regards to the supply of electrical energy from renewable sources of a stochastic nature, which are used as dominant sources of electric or heat energy. Variations in short-circuit power may significantly affect the system stability and may {{have a negative impact on}} the operation in case of sensitive appliances. We developed tools and methods to keep the power quality parameters in <b>Off-Grid</b> <b>systems</b> within the limits using an intelligent approach based on an artificial intelligence technique. Our computational model is able to predict disturbances in power quality and perform a set of proper reactions to avoid such disturbances with over 60 % success rate in time horizon of 15 min ahead. As a result, it is subsequently possible to optimize the operation of <b>Off-Grid</b> <b>systems</b> and thus contribute to improvements in the power quality parameters in <b>Off-Grid</b> <b>systems.</b> Web of Science 14717316...|$|R

In this paper, two topologies of <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> are presented and compared to chose more suitable one for an off-grid home.

50|$|A {{stand-alone}} or <b>off-grid</b> <b>system</b> is {{not connected}} to the electrical grid. Standalone systems vary widely in size and application from wristwatches or calculators to remote buildings or spacecraft. If the load is to be supplied independently of solar insolation, the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery. In non-portable applications where weight is not an issue, such as in buildings, lead acid batteries are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse.|$|E

(An alternative approach commonly used in spacecraft is to divert surplus PV power into a resistive load, allowing the panel to operate continuously at its peak power point.) ...|$|E

The results show that the sustained decline in photovoltaic module¿s price contributes to subsequent decline in LCOE, whereas the increase in the price of grid electricity and materials related to the connection makes <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> more cost-effective for remote areas. Finally, to determine if the photovoltaic system could be an economic alternative for investments in remote regions, a comparison between the cost of grid extension and the LCOE of a high capacity photovoltaic system was undertaken...|$|R

50|$|The term “Off-grid” {{itself is}} very broad and simply refers to “not using or {{depending}} on electricity provided through main or national grids and generated by main power infrastructures.

40|$|The {{variability}} of solar energy in off-grid systems dictates the sizing of energy storage systems {{along with the}} sizing and scheduling of loads present in the <b>off-grid</b> <b>system.</b> Unfortunately, energy storage may be costly, while frequent switching of loads {{in the absence of}} an energy storage system causes wear and tear and should be avoided. Yet, the amount of solar energy utilized should be maximized and the problem of finding the optimal static load size of a finite number of discrete electric loads on the basis of a load response optimization is considered in this paper. The objective of the optimization is to maximize solar energy utilization without the need for costly energy storage systems in an <b>off-grid</b> <b>system.</b> Conceptual and real data for solar photovoltaic power production is provided the input to the <b>off-grid</b> <b>system.</b> Given the number of units, the following analytical solutions and computational algorithms are proposed to compute the optimal load size of each unit: mixed-integer linear programming and constrained least squares. Based on the available solar power profile, the algorithms select the optimal on/off switch times and maximize solar energy utilization by computing the optimal static load sizes. The effectiveness of the algorithms is compared using one year of solar power data from San Diego, California and Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that the annual system solar energy utilization is optimized to 73 % when using two loads and can be boosted up to 98 % using a six load configuration.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the development, implementation and application of a novel mathematical procedure devoted to formulating the daily load profiles of off-grid consumers in rural areas. The procedure aims at providing such profiles as input data for the design process of <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> for rural electrification. Indeed, daily load profiles represent an essential input for <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> capacity planning methods based on steady-state energy simulation and lifetime techno-economic analyses, and {{for the analysis of}} the logics to control the energy fluxes among the different system components. Nevertheless, no particular attention has been devoted so far in the scientific literature as regards specific approaches for daily load profiles estimates for rural consumers. In order to contribute to covering this gap, we developed a new mathematical procedure taking into consideration the specific features of rural areas. The procedure is based on a set of data that can be surveyed and/or assumed in rural areas, and it relies on a stochastic bottom-up approach with correlations between the different load profile parameters (i. e. load factor, coincidence factor and number of consumers) in order to build up the coincidence behavior of the electrical appliances. We have implemented the procedure in a software tool (LoadProGen) which can eventually support the <b>off-grid</b> <b>systems</b> design process for rural electrification. Finally, we have applied the procedure to a case study in order to clarify the proposed approach...|$|R
