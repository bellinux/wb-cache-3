500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In {{the middle of the}} stairway, all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard His …voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Mushroom {{was eager}} {{to connect with the}} 'new wave' in England and brought over Peter Solley, an English {{producer}} and latter-day Procol Harum member, to produce another Mushroom artist, The Sports. One night Solley saw Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons perform, and on the strength of their new song, [...] "Shape I'm In", asked to produce the group. The first single, [...] "Hit and Run", from the album, Screaming Targets, was pop reggae and reached No.12 on the charts in August 1979. Camilleri said he [...] "never thought 'Hit and Run' would do anything but maybe the lick was infectious enough – though as a song it was a bit stupid – but it got us a deal all over the world. It was a wacky thing and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> were away in a different arena".|$|E

Once we asked Father about it, but he looked so sorrowful all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> that <b>we</b> wished we hadn't. He said it was all his fault. I didn't see how that could be, but I never said anything more about it to Father. Still, I did wish we had some relations.|$|R
2500|$|All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> had two Australian {{teams on}} one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I {{was waiting in}} a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had {{other people who were}} barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1992, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Beautiful Son," [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] and [...] "Old Age" [...] during a recording session at Word of Mouth Recording in Seattle with producer Jack Endino. The three-song session was later released in April 1993 as Hole's fourth single on the City Slang label. On January 21, 1993, Love and Schemel recorded five demo songs at BMG Ariola Ltda. in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produced by Craig Montgomery, the session was originally a demo session for Nirvana, who were recording material for their upcoming studio album, In Utero (1993). During breaks in Nirvana's session, Love and Schemel recorded {{a number of}} songs later featured on Live Through This, including [...] "Miss World," [...] "She Walks on Me," [...] "I Think That I Would Die" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest." [...] The band relocated back to Los Angeles where they recruited former Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff in early 1993; Pfaff was also an accomplished cellist and music student. Erlandson said of Pfaff's membership: [...] "That's when we took off, all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> became a real band." [...] After a brief tour of the United Kingdom {{in the summer of}} 1993, the band sent a series of demos to the record label. [...] "When we got the Live Through This demos, I realized very quickly that Hole had gotten a new rhythm section," [...] said producer Sean Slade. [...] "It was much more musical." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{stopped a}} minute. I tore off {{the sleeve of}} my hunting shirt, and then Rube gave me <b>a</b> bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cut on the arm. I let the blood run till the sleeve was soaked and dripping, then Rube tore off a strip from his shirt and bandaged my arm up tight. We rolled the sleeve in a ball and threw it down, then took a turn, made a zigzag or two to puzzle the brute, {{and then went on}} our line again. For another ten minutes we could hear the barking get nearer and nearer, and then it stopped all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden.</b> On <b>we</b> went, and it was half an hour again before we heard it, and then it was a long way off.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of sudden stops on output growth and export and import responses. First, we define and identify <b>sudden</b> stops. <b>We</b> show that <b>sudden</b> stops are fairly common since the late 70 s. Then, by looking at this large pool of country experiences we study how openness, liability dollarization and the choice of exchange rate regime shape the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop. <b>We</b> find that openness and flexible rates contribute to a better output recovery, while liability dollarization worsens such recovery. We also find that open countries adjust the current account through higher export growth and less import contraction while the opposite holds for countries with large liability dollarization. These stylized facts allow {{to think about what}} may help an economy prepare for <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop, in contrast with the traditional policy recommendations that concentrated on preventing such events. ...|$|R

60|$|So {{we passed}} the curtain, and stood upon the portico, looking at the garden misty with moonlight, and talking of this and that--about the Israelites, I think, who, as we heard, were {{wandering}} in the deserts of Sinai.

50|$|The popular {{misconception}} {{was that}} it was a chauvinistic tune, which was anything but the case. The fact was, we came from a very strait-laced, conservative, laid-back country, and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> there <b>we</b> were in Chicago, Detroit, New York - all these horrendously large places with their big city problems. After that one particularly grinding tour, it was just a real treat to go home and see the girls we had grown up with. Also, the war was going on, and that was terribly unpopular. We didn't have a draft system in Canada, and we were grateful for that. <b>A</b> lot <b>of</b> people called it anti-American, but it wasn't really. We weren't anti-anything.

5000|$|About four p.m., the enemy's {{artillery}} {{in front}} of us ceased firing all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> and <b>we</b> saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge. You discovered at a distance what appeared to be an overwhelming, long moving line, which, ever advancing, glittered like <b>a</b> stormy wave <b>of</b> the sea when it catches the sunlight. On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields <b>of</b> Europe. In <b>an</b> almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting [...] "Vive l'Empereur!" [...] The word of command, [...] "Prepare to receive cavalry", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.

60|$|Now {{and then}} for several days {{together}} we sat in our log-built shelter while a blinding snowstorm raged outside and the pines filled the valley with their roaring. Then there were weeks of bitter frost, when work was partly suspended, and both rock and soil defied our efforts. One of our best horses died and another fell over a precipice. Hay was hardly to be bought with money, provisions only at an exorbitant cost, and though we received a few interim payments it was, as Johnston said, even chances either way if we kept on top, because every day of enforced idleness cost us many dollars. However, floundering through snow-slush, swinging the axe in driving sleet and rain, or hauling the mossy logs through the mire <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> thaw, <b>we</b> persisted in our task, though often at nights we sat inside the shanty, which was filled with steaming garments, counting the cost, in <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> gloomy despondency. Except for the thought of Grace, there were moments when I might have yielded; but we were always an obstinate race, and seeing that I was steadfastly determined to hold out to the last, the others gallantly aided me. Now, when the time of stress is past, I know how much I owe to their loyalty.|$|R

Then we try to wrestle with God, and cry to Him--and what else can we do?--like {{children}} lost in the dark; entreat Him, if there be mercy in Him--as there is, in spite of all our folly--to grant some special providence, to give us some answer to our bitter entreaties.

We show that the critical behavior of the statistics of the excitations, signaling the non-thermal nature of the transition are robust against changing protocol. An intriguing crossover in the equal time correlation function, related to an anomalous coarsening is also discussed. Comment: 12 pages; 8 figure...|$|R
5000|$|It was an {{advantage}} for Collins {{to have the}} Fleming/Morgan writers working {{with him on a}} daily basis. Fleming stated, [...] "If he's cut <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> songs on somebody and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> he says <b>we</b> need a song that's 'more country' than this, or 'more pop' or whatever to fill out an album, then he can tell us." [...] Not only could Collins custom tailor the songs to each artist, but the writers benefited because their creations were then {{much more likely to be}} recorded by established artists. In the summer of 1980, Collins told his writers he wanted a new song for Ronnie Milsap that featured the region of western North Carolina where Milsap was born and raised. He suggested [...] "Appalachian Rain" [...] as a possible title. Fleming and Morgan decided to let the geographical spot be an image that would stimulate the imagination of the listener, without <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> detail, reminiscent of Jimmy Webb's song [...] "Wichita Lineman".|$|R

5000|$|In Nashville in 1977, she {{met with}} producer/publisher Tom Collins at Pi-Gem Music, a meeting she {{described}} as [...] "life-changing". She played some songs for him and said [...] "tell {{me what you want}} and I can write it". He signed her as a staff writer and she was paired with songwriter Dennis Morgan who was an excellent guitarist and had more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pop background. This duo set up a daily schedule to write beginning at 10 AM each weekday. She has called Dennis Morgan the [...] "perfect creative partner". They averaged about one finished song per week. The Fleming/Morgan duo then created one hit song after another for about 6 years. Fleming was in touch with Tom Collins almost daily and could create a song targeted by him directly to one of his clients, including Ronnie Milsap, Barbara Mandrell, Sylvia, and others. Fleming said, [...] "If he's cut <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> songs on somebody and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> he says <b>we</b> need a song that's 'more country' than this, or 'more pop' or whatever to fill out an album then he can tell us." [...] This arrangement not only benefitted Collins, but also the authors because it gave them a much greater chance that their songs would be recorded by established artists. In the summer of 1988, Collins requested a song something like [...] "Appalachian Rain" [...] about the area of North Carolina where Ronnie Milsap was born. Fleming and Morgan came up with the song [...] "Smoky Mountain Rain" [...] which became a huge hit for MIlsap. Fleming said it was [...] "a matter of just talking about it—what it feels like in the Smokies". The song went to number one on both the country charts and Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. Rolling Stone named it as of the [...] "100 Greatest County Songs of All Time". [...] The song was designated the current [...] "Tennessee State Song" [...] in 2010 by the state legislature. [...] She enjoyed working with Tom Collins' staff and developed a friendship with Collins' receptionist, Sylvia Jane Kirby (Allen), who had aspirations <b>of</b> becoming <b>a</b> recording artist herself. Collins finally acquiesced to her wish. Fleming and Morgan wrote two songs for the former receptionist who had decided to go only by her first name, Sylvia. These were [...] "Tumbleweed" [...] and [...] "Nobody". The former was a top 10 hit, and latter reached #1 on the country charts and was a crossover hit, reaching #15 on the pop charts. The song [...] "Nobody" [...] was nominated for a Grammy and won BMI's 1982 Song of the Year for receiving more radio air play than any other song.|$|R
