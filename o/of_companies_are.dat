25|$|In {{more recent}} times, a number <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> selling {{composite}} railroad ties manufactured from recycled plastic resins, and recycled rubber. Manufacturers claim a service life longer than wooden ties with an expected lifetime {{in the range}} of 30–80 years, that the ties are impervious to rot and insect attack, and that they can be modified with a special relief on the bottom to provide additional lateral stability. In some main track applications the hybrid plastic tie has a recessed design to be completely surrounded by ballast.|$|E
25|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> {{now making}} lightweight, {{portable}} speaker systems for small venues that route the low-frequency {{parts of the}} music (electric bass, bass drum, etc.) to a powered subwoofer. Routing the low-frequency energy to a separate amplifier and subwoofer can substantially improve the bass-response of the system. Also, clarity may be enhanced, because low-frequency sounds take {{a great deal of}} power to amplify; with only a single amplifier for the entire sound spectrum, the power-hungry low-frequency sounds can take a disproportionate amount of the sound system's power.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, Delaware {{has one of}} the few {{remaining}} Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{some forms}} <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to have}} existed during Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, the closest {{recognizable}} ancestors of the modern company did not appear until the 16th century. With increasing international trade, Royal charters were granted in Europe (notably in England and Holland) to merchant adventurers. [...] The Royal charters usually conferred special privileges on the trading company (including, usually, some form of monopoly). [...] Originally, traders in these entities traded stock on their own account, but later the members came to operate on joint account and with joint stock, and the new Joint stock company was born.|$|E
2500|$|In many countries, laws provide {{protection}} from workplace {{discrimination based on}} gender identity or gender expression, including masculine women and feminine men. An increasing number <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> including [...] "gender identity and expression" [...] in their non-discrimination policies. Often these laws and policies do not cover all situations and are not strictly enforced. California's anti-discrimination laws protect transsexual persons {{in the workplace and}} specifically prohibit employers from terminating or refusing to hire a person based on their transsexuality. The European Union provides employment protection as part of gender discrimination protections following the European Court of Justice decisions in P v S and Cornwall County Council.|$|E
2500|$|Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> {{enormously}} {{successful in}} this new found market, with some virtual items being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. [...] Some of these companies sell multiple virtual goods for multiple games, and others sell services for single games. Virtual real estate is earning real world money, with people like 43-year-old Wonder Bread deliveryman, John Dugger, purchasing a virtual real estate for $750, setting him back more than a weeks wages. This virtual property includes nine rooms, three stories, rooftop patio, wall of solid stonework in a prime location, nestled {{at the foot of}} a quiet coastal hillside. Dugger represents a group of gamers that are not in the market for a real house but instead to own a small piece of the vast computer database that was Ultima Online, the mythical world in which the venerable MMO Ultima Online unfolds. Such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2014, the Las Vegas Sun {{featured}} {{an article}} about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by AVN magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the Sun article, Andrea Domanick, [...] "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, [...] "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I think that a lot <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> doing what we’re doing. They’re setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don’t want a target on their back." [...] Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, [...] "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use." [...] The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, [...] "A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It’s a very good training ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|Music producer, Steve Morales, took T Lopez to Miami, Florida {{to begin}} {{recording}} her own music. Later Lopez {{would join the}} cast of a TV cable network that caters to the bicultural Latino population called Sí TV, where she would co-hosts a Latin American music show, The Drop. Lopez continued acting, hosting, and recording music. After putting a few movies, multiple TV appearances, and an album's worth of songs under her belt, T Lopez met brothers and co-CEO's of Cash Money Records, Ronald [...] "Slim" [...] Williams and Bryan [...] "Baby" [...] Williams, and they invited her to visit their New Orleans, Louisiana home base. T Lopez was very impressed by their loyalty to each other, but she asked the guys if {{they really wanted to}} work with her and her music because it was so different. Slim is great, he takes great care of me and he is really involved in my project T Lopez said. T Lopez said that heads <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> not always like that. Then T Lopez officially joined the Cash Money family and has not looked back since. T Lopez is currently recording on her as-yet-untitled solo debut album in Miami, Florida, with features from T-Pain, Daddy Yankee, Lil Wayne, Flo Rida, Glasses Malone, Colby O'Donis and Birdman. Producers Timbaland, J.R. Rotem, Rodney Jerkins are also along to build what's best described as urban pop. In 2008, she collaborated with Los del Rio, The Art of Sound, and The D.E.Y. on [...] "Macarena (The Art of Sound Group Mix)", in honor of the 15th anniversary of the Macarena.|$|E
6000|$|The {{mystery of}} this placidity had been already solved by our captain, whom I had asked what price I should bargain to pay from the steamer to the shore. [...] "There is a tariff," [...] said he, [...] "and the boatmen keep to it. The Neapolitans are good people, (buona gente,) and only needed justice {{to make them}} obedient to the laws." [...] I must say that I found this to be true. The fares of all public conveyances are now fixed, and the {{attempts}} which drivers occasionally make to cheat you, seem to be rather the involuntary impulses of old habit than deliberate intentions to do you wrong. You pay what is due, and as your man merely rumbles internally when you turn away, {{you must be a}} very timid signorin, indeed, if you buy his content with any thing more. I fancy that all these things are now much better managed in Italy than in America, only we grumble at them there and stand them in silence at home. Every one can recall frightful instances of plunder, in which he was the victim, at New York--in which the robbery had none of the neatness of an operation, as it often has in Italy, but was a brutal mutilation. And then as regards civility from the same kind of people in the two countries, there is no comparison that holds in favor of us. All questions are readily and politely answered in Italian travel, and the servants <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> required to be courteous to the public whereas, one is only too glad to receive a silent snub from such people at home.|$|E
