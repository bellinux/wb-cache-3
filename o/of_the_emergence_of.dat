5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> MDR-TB, surgery {{has been}} re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It {{involves}} removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") {{in the lungs}} {{to reduce the number}} of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Good {{evidence}} exists for {{the appearance of}} gastropods (e.g. Aldanella), cephalopods (e.g. Plectronoceras, ?Nectocaris) and bivalves (Pojetaia, Fordilla) towards {{the middle of the}} Cambrian period, c. , though arguably each of these may belong only to the stem lineage of their respective classes. However, the evolutionary history both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> molluscs from the ancestral group Lophotrochozoa, and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms, is still vigorously debated.|$|E
5|$|Such {{efforts were}} premature, {{and did not}} succeed; only 24,000 Jews were living in Palestine on the eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Zionism within the world's Jewish {{communities}} {{in the last two}} decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of World War I, the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to a renewal of strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.|$|E

5|$|The subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> castles is {{a complex}} matter {{which has led to}} {{considerable}} debate. Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods of insecurity and building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.|$|E
5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} activity, from the mid-8th century on, was a manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures {{on a new}} level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example. The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E

5|$|Ancona {{was quickly}} readied for combat when Italy {{declared}} {{war against the}} Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. The following month, she joined the Italian fleet at the Battle of Lissa. She was stationed in the van of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet. Ancona was damaged by Austrian shellfire, including one shell that started a fire. Her career was uneventful after the war, resulting from a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was eventually sold for scrapping in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{involved}} himself {{heavily in}} discussions over army reform, {{the need for}} which had become apparent with the failings of the Boer War. He supported the redesign of army command, {{the creation of the}} Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.|$|E

5|$|San Martino saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa, fought during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. There {{she was in the}} center of the action, at the head of the Italian main body. Of the three ships in her division, San Martino was the only vessel to survive the battle. After the war, the ship's career was uneventful, the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> more modern ironclads and a severe {{reduction}} in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the teleosts {{has been}} subject to long debate, without consensus on either their phylogeny or the timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the major groups before the application of modern DNA-based cladistic analysis. Near et al. (2012) explored the phylogeny and divergence times of every major lineage, analysing the DNA sequences of 9 unlinked genes in 232 species. They obtained well-resolved phylogenies with {{strong support for the}} nodes (so, the pattern of branching shown is likely to be correct). They calibrated (set actual values for) branching times in this tree from 36 reliable measurements of absolute time from the fossil record. The teleosts are divided into the major clades shown on the cladogram, with dates, following Near et al.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, {{were in the}} Sanskrit language. Prominent {{works of}} this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mahābhārata and the Ramayana, the dramas of Kālidāsa such as the Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā), and poetry such as the Mahākāvya. Kamasutra, the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, {{is regarded as a}} predecessor of Tamil literature. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> devotional poets such as Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore, who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
