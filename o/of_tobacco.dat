5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E
5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves.

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin).

His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E

Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, and the idea that caffeine has negative health effects.

40|$|Background: Smokeless tobacco {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{as a substitute}} for cigarette smoking. On the contrary, the use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> is fraught with health risk and needs to be discouraged. Although previous reports have described long-term harmful effects <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> on various body parameters, little is known about short-term effects <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> on cardio-respiratory parameters. Very few studies have been undertaken on the effect of short-term use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> in India on cardio-respiratory parameters of youngsters. This aspect of use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> needs to be attended to. Material and Methods: The present study has been undertaken to study the effect <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> on cardio-respiratory fitness tests in young healthy tobacco chewers compared to age- and sex-matched nontobacco chewing healthy controls. Various cardio-respiratory parameters like resting HR, delta HR, MVV, VE max, VO 2 max were studied by using treadmill exercise testing and computerized spirometry. Results: In the present study no statistically significant difference was found in any parameter studied that {{can be attributed to the}} residual effect of short-term use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco.</b> Conclusion: This is the reason enough to discourage smokeless tobacco from this unhealthy habit at this early stage itself before permanent residual effects on health is seen...|$|R
5|$|Mason devoted {{much effort}} during the American Revolutionary War to {{safeguarding}} Fairfax County and the rivers of Virginia, since the British several times raided areas along the Potomac. Control of {{the rivers and}} of Chesapeake Bay was urgent as Virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to the French and other European nations. The export <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> generally via the West Indies, allowed Mason and others to obtain, via France and Holland, British-made items such as cloth, clothing patterns, medicines, and hardware.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{implemented}} more anti-tobacco policies {{at the end}} of the 1930s and by {{the early}} years of World War II, the rate <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> usage declined. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht, the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. According to a survey conducted in 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|The first skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{occupied}} by male workers, but this changed during the 1890s, with female employees becoming more common. The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900. Various moral concerns were raised about {{men and women}} mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women. The new female workers typically worked as typists or stenographers, using the recently invented typewriter, which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890.|$|E
40|$|Use <b>of</b> {{smokeless}} <b>tobacco</b> in the United States {{has been}} relatively constant in recent years, as tobacco companies continue aggressive marketing campaigns. The health effects <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> use need further documentation. Thus, the authors examined whether current use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> was associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 14, 498 men and women aged 45 – 64 years at baseline (1987 – 1989) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. There were 2, 572 incident CVD events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, coronary death, or stroke) during a median of 16. 7 years of follow-up (maximum = 19. 1 years). Current use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> at baseline was associated with 1. 27 -fold greater CVD incidence (95 % confidence interval: 1. 06, 1. 52) than was nonuse, independently of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle and other tobacco-related variables. Past use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> {{was not associated with}} CVD incidence. In conclusion, current use <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> was associated with increased risk of CVD incidence in ARIC cigarette nonsmokers. Current users <b>of</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> should be informed of its harm and advised to quit the practice. Current cigarette smokers should also be given sufficient information on safe, therapeutic methods of quitting which do not include switching to smokeless tobacco...|$|R
