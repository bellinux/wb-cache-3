She is a unique type of zerg; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind.</b> Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E

Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash.

Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of the EU {{in terms of}} international or constitutional law has been much debated.

Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure.

40|$|Tsunami is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> natural {{disasters}} that leave people {{some time for}} escape. This escape time, which is essentially {{the time for the}} giant wave to propagate from the epicentre to a coast, has to be estimated without delay upon the occurrence of the incident. With the advancement of water wave theories, much work has been done to model the propagation of tsunamis from deep oceans to shallow water. The authors argue that while much emphasis has been put on the expansion of the high-tech early warning system and the development of complicated tsunami models, a simple-to-use yet accurate predictive model is still wanting. This paper presents a handy linear wave model, which is capable of estimating the arrival time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tsunami with very good accuracy, as has been verified by comparison with past incidents.
