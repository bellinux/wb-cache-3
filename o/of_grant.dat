5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much <b>of</b> <b>Grant</b> Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style.

After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end <b>of</b> <b>Grant</b> Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature.

The land was purchased by 1913, and John W.
