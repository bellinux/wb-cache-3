5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of <b>one</b> <b>former</b> island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E

Private Frederick George Kite, born at Wormshill on 16 February 1894, and educated at Wormshill and Milstead, enlisted on 8 September 1915. Originally employed as a fireman, after training at Blackboy and Broadmeadows camps in Victoria, he sailed from Melbourne as part of the Australian Imperial Force, 16th Infantry Battalion aboard HMAT Ceramic A40 on 23 December 1914. He participated in the landing at Gallipoli and was wounded in the left arm and shoulder, ending his active service.|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to <b>one</b> <b>former</b> Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

San Lorenzo's victory was then followed by another Argentine club's victory, River Plate, winning its third title on 2015. But Atletico Nacional stopped this new trend, by beating Ecuador's Independiente del Valle on a 2-1 aggregate. The Colombian team won their second title after 27 years and <b>one</b> <b>former</b> failure attempt in 1995 against Grêmio, becoming the first pacific team to reach that achievement {{in the history of the}} tournament.|$|E

5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least <b>one</b> <b>former</b> consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|E

5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. <b>One</b> <b>former</b> monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. <b>One</b> <b>former</b> extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
