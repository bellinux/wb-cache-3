40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} how an entrepreneur and leader, transmits a vision through communication. Furthermore what kind of feedback the leader finds that he/she acquire. We want to study how entrepreneurship and leadership appears at a private preschool and how the entrepreneur and leader use it to communicate his/her vision. This thesis is based on qualitative method using one in-depth interview with CEO at Helianthus AB, documents and one observation at a parental meeting. The theories of which this study is based on consist of entrepreneurship, transformational and transactional leadership, vision and communication. The theories used in this thesis regard entrepreneurship, transformational and transactional leadership, vision and communication. Our study strengthened the assumption that <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> is an entrepreneur and leader according to chosen theories. She communicates her vision to people that surrounds her through her entrepreneurship and leadership. The communication differs depending on whom she communicates to. According to the chosen theory {{we came to the}} conclusion that <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> has good communication with her customers (children and parents) and employees.

Our analysis focuses on the role of 'caring' as a particular form of this relationship, suggesting that <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> uses this as a cultural resource to identify as a mathematician. We argue that caring supports her access to central mathematical spaces and, consequently, her potential to change the nature of mathematics itself...|$|R

A mix of snowball and convenience sample has been used and among <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> {{there are a variety}} and mix of the following variables: gender, position (manager/practitioner), race (blacks/white) and organization sector(public/parastatal/private). Our main findings are that equality and equity are highly debated topics and that the laws regulating them have a major effect on the HR professionals’ dailywork. The study gives us various perspectives of employment equity but a majority of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> do believe that the regulation of employment equity is needed. We find that there are obstacles for achieving equality in South African workplaces and <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> have given us examples of different ways of how to tackle them.

40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{investigate}} the general public knowledge, source of knowledge, and practice towards antibiotics {{in the state of}} Penang Malaysia. Methods: A cross sectional study design using convenience sampling technique was adopted in this study from May 2010 until August 2010. A pre-validated questionnaire was developed and distributed to 700 participants in the state of Penang, Malaysia. All data was analysed using SPSS version 16. A p-value of less than 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: 85. 6 % of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> could correctly identify that antibiotics are used for bacterial infections whereas almost 58 % believed that antibiotics are used for viral infections. Physicians and pharmacists were the main sources of knowledge about antibiotics. While around 30 % of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> rely on the internet, family members and friends as their sources of information about antibiotics. Malpractice regarding antibiotics use was found in a high proportion of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> where many use antibiotics without prescription, prescribe the leftover antibiotics to their friends and family members while others modify the antibiotics dose without referring to healthcare professional and others stop the antibiotics course once they feel that their symptoms improve. Conclusion: Malpractice regarding antibiotics was found in a great proportion of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> which might be due to the irrational prescription of antibiotics by healthcare professionals as well as due to the misleading sources of knowledge about antibiotics.

Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey conducted among 175 Family Physicians at two national conferences. Results: Majority (97. 7 %) of the respondents {{was aware of the}} concept of HIV PEP and 99. 4 % believed it was effective in preventing HIV transmission. Over two third of <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> had been exposed to NSI; however, less than 25 % of those exposed received PEP.

40|$|Drawing upon {{qualitative}} {{interviews with}} monozygotic (identical) twins sharing 100 % of their genes, and with dizygotic (fraternal) twins and singletons as control groups, this paper explores {{what it means}} to be genetically identical. (The twins interviewed were from the TwinsUK register in London.) In the context of the ongoing debate on human reproductive cloning, it examines questions such as: To what extent do identical twins perceive their emotional and physical bond to be a result of their genetic makeup? What would they think if they had been deliberately created genetically identical? How would they feel about being genetically identical to a person who was born a few years earlier or later? First, <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> ascribed no great significance to the role of genes in their understanding of {{what it means to}} be identical twins. Second, the opinion that human reproductive cloning would "interfere with nature", or "contradict God's will", was expressed by <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> exclusively on the abstract level. The more <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> were able to relate a particular invented cloning scenario to their own life-worlds, the lower the prevalence of the argument. Third, for all three groups of respondents, the scenario of having been born in one of the other groups was perceived as strange. Fourth, the aspect that <b>our</b> <b>respondents</b> disliked about cloning scenarios was the potential motives of the cloners. Without equating monozygotic twins directly with "clones", these results from "naturally" genetically identical individuals add a new dimension to what a future cloning situation could entail: The cloned person might possibly (a) perceive a close physical and emotional connection to the progenitor as a blessing; (b) suffer from preconceptions of people who regard physical likeness as a sign of incomplete individuality; and (c) perceive the idea of not having been born a clone of a particular person as unpleasant.

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Representatives (chief executive officers, medical directors, and quality-improvement directors) from 24 health plans in four states were surveyed. The overall response rate was 58. 3 percent, with a mean of 1. 8 respondents per plan. STUDY DESIGN: This exploratory qualitative research used a purposive sample of respondents.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All managed care organizations interviewed use performance measures for quality improvement but the degree and sophistication of use varies. Many of <b>our</b> <b>respondent</b> plans use performance measures to target quality-improvement initiatives, evaluate current performance, establish goals for quality improvement, identify the root cause of problems, and monitor performance.
