40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of licensed channel Primary User's (PU) temporal statistics {{is important for}} Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) systems. With accurate {{estimation of}} the mean duty cycle, u, and the mean off- and <b>on-times</b> of PUs, DSA systems can more efficiently assign PU resources to its subscribers, thus, increasing channel utilization. This paper presents a mathematical analysis of the accuracy of estimating u, {{as well as the}} PU mean off- and <b>on-times,</b> where the estimation accuracy is expressed as the mean squared estimation error. The analysis applies for the traffic model assuming exponentially distributed PU off- and <b>on-times,</b> which is a common model in traffic literature. The estimation accuracy is quantified {{as a function of the}} number of samples and observation window length, hence, this work provides guidelines on traffic parameters estimation for both energy-constrained and delay-constrained applications. For estimating u, we consider uniform, non-uniform, and weighted sample stream averaging, as well as maximum likelihood estimation. The estimation accuracy of the mean PU off- and <b>on-times</b> is studied when maximum likelihood estimation is employed. Furthermore, we develop algorithms for the blind estimation of the traffic parameters based on the derived theoretical estimation accuracy expressions. We show that the estimation error for all traffic parameters is lower bounded for a fixed observation window length due to the correlation between the traffic samples. Moreover, we prove that for estimating u, maximum likelihood estimation can yield the same estimation error as weighted sample averaging using only half the observation window length...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies showed}} that many types of network traffic exhibit {{long-range}} dependence (LRD), i. e., burstiness {{on a wide variety}} of time-scales. Given that traffic streams are indeed endowed with LRD properties, a next question is: what is their impact on network performance? To assess this issue, we consider a generic source model: traffic generated by an individual user is modeled as a fluid on/off pattern with generally distributed on- and off-times; LRD traffic is obtained by choosing the <b>on-times</b> heavy-tailed. We focus on an aggregation of many i. i. d. sources, say n, multiplexed on a FIFO queue, with the queueing resources scaled accordingly. Large deviations analysis says that the (steady-state) overflow probability decays exponentially in n; we call the corresponding decay rate, as a function of the buffer size B, the loss curve. To get insight into the influence of the distribution of the on- and off-times, we list the most significant properties of the loss curve. Strikingly, for small B, the decay rate depends on the distributions only through their means. For large B there is no such insensitivity property. In case of heavy-tailed <b>on-times,</b> the decay of the loss probability in the buffer size is slower than exponential; this is in stark contrast with light-tailed <b>on-times,</b> in which case this decay is at least exponential. To assess the sensitivity of the performance metrics to the probabilistic properties of the input, we compute the loss curve for a number of representative examples (voice, video, file transfer, web browsing, etc.), with realistic distributions and parameters. Our conclusions on the impact of LRD on the performance can be summarized as follows: (1) If the maximally tolerable delay is relatively small, there is hardly any difference between heavy-tailed and light-tailed inputs; this gives a theoretical handle on observations that appeared in the literature. Only for very delay tolerant applications the above-mentioned large B results kick in. (2) The level of aggregation is a significant factor. If the ratio between the link rate and the peak rate of a single source is high, a high utilization can be achieved, while at the same time the delay requirements are met; this holds even if the delay requirements are stringent...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{reversible}} photoswitching in {{bulk samples}} or in individual molecules of Dronpa, a mutant {{of a green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) -like fluorescent protein, has been demonstrated. Intense irradiation at 488 nm changed Dronpa in a dim protonated form, and weak irradiation at 405 nm restored it to the bright deprotonated form. Here, {{we report on the}} mechanism of photoswitching of Dronpa by means of ensemble and single-molecule spectroscopy. Ensemble spectroscopy shows that the photoswitching can be described, in first approximation, by a three-state model including a deprotonated (B), a protonated (A(1)), and a photoswitched protonated (A(2)) forms of the chromophore. While the B and the A 1 forms are in a ground state acid-base equilibrium, the B and the A 2 forms are reversibly photoswitched upon irradiation with 488 and 405 nm light. At the single-molecule level, the <b>on-times</b> in fluorescence intensity trajectories excited at 488 nm decrease with increasing the excitation power, consistent with the photoswitching from the B to A(2) form. The <b>on-times</b> agree well with expected values, which are calculated based on the ensemble spectroscopic properties of Dronpa. The fluorescence trajectory obtained with simultaneous dual-color excitation at 488 and 405 nm demonstrates reversible photoswitching between the B and the A(2) forms at the single-molecule level. The efficency of the photoswitching from the A(2) to B form increased with increasing the excitation power of the 405 nm light. Our results demonstrate that Dronpa holds its outstanding photoswitching properties, based on a photo-induced protonation/deprotonation process, even at the single-molecule level. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks, {{secondary}} users (SUs) scavenge for unused {{frequency spectrum}} by performing spectrum sensing. Multi-stage sensing {{is a novel}} concept that refers to a general class of DSA spectrum sensing algorithms that divide the sensing process {{into a number of}} sequential stages. The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per stage can be used to optimize performance with respect to SU throughput, energy consumption per bit, and the probability of collision between licensed (primary) and SUs. In this work, we present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation of different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for DSA networks. The contribution of our work lies in studying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of sensing stages, physical layer sensing technique and duration per stage, single and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels, primary user (PU) and SU traffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Our results emphasize the fact that the performance of multi-stage sensing is superior to the single stage sensing counterpart, where the optimal number of sensing stages and sensing duration per stage depend on the network traffic. For DSA spectrum sensing algorithms in general, and multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms in specific, DSA systems can assign PU resources to its subscribers more efficiently if knowledge of PU temporal statistics is available. In this work, we explore the benefit of incorporating PU traffic statistics in spectrum sensing algorithms. Moreover, we study the impact of PU traffic parameter estimation errors on algorithm performance. We extend our study to investigate the accuracy bounds on PU traffic parameter estimation. We present a mathematical analysis of the accuracy of estimating the mean PU duty cycle, and the PU mean off- and <b>on-times,</b> where the estimation accuracy is expressed in terms of the mean squared estimation error. The analysis applies for the traffic model assuming exponentially distributed PU off- and <b>on-times.</b> We derive the Cramer-Rao bounds on the estimation error of the mean PU duty cycle, and the mean PU off- and <b>on-times.</b> The bounds are derived for the case when perfect knowledge is assumed for one of the parameters, and the case where all parameters are jointly estimated. Besides, the impact of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation accuracy is studied analytically. Furthermore, we propose a number of estimators for the traffic parameters and quantify their estimation accuracy. Finally, we develop algorithms for the blind estimation of the traffic parameters based on the derived theoretical estimation accuracy expressions. We show that, for a fixed observation window length, the estimation error for all traffic parameters is lower bounded due to the correlation between the traffic samples, while on the other hand, the impact of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation error of the mean PU duty cycle can be eliminated by increasing the number of traffic samples...|$|R

In order to maintain a stable attitude during the course of its mission, this three-axis stabilized spacecraft uses two different control systems: the RCS and the reaction wheel assembly control system. The RCS is used to execute a commanded spacecraft slew, to maintain three-axis attitude control, control spacecraft's attitude while performing science observations with coarse pointing requirements, e. g. during targeted low-altitude Titan and Enceladus flybys, bias the momentum of reaction wheels, and to perform RCS-based orbit trim maneuvers. The use of RCS often imparts undesired delta V on the spacecraft. The Cassini navigation team requires accurate predictions of the delta V in spacecraft coordinates and inertial frame resulting from slews using RCS thrusters and more importantly from reaction wheel bias events. It is crucial for the Cassini spacecraft attitude control and navigation teams to be able to, quickly but accurately, predict the hydrazine usage and delta V for various reaction wheel bias events without actually having to spend time and resources simulating the event in flight software-based dynamic simulation or hardware-in-the-loop simulation environments. The methodology described in this paper, and the ground software developed thereof, are designed to provide just that.
