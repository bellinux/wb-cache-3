5|$|Cardinal Orsini, the {{official}} {{representative of the}} Neapolitan court, and all the foreigners, were not classified because it was certain that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ever elected pope.|$|E
5|$|Major General William Bridges {{decided that}} the Duntroon cadets, none of whom had yet {{finished}} their training, should be split up and posted to the various units of the AIF as regimental rather than staff officers. Robertson was posted to the 10th Light Horse as its machine-gun officer. He was one of seven members of his class in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. By the end of August 1915, three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|The partisans arrested Mussolini {{and took}} him to Dongo, where he spent part of the night in the local barracks. In all, over fifty fascist leaders and their {{families}} were found in the convoy and arrested by the partisans. Aside from Mussolini and Petacci, sixteen of the most prominent <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> summarily shot in Dongo the following day and a further ten would be killed over two successive nights.|$|E

60|$|A {{few months}} ago a good many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> willing to profit by the invitation, but that night nobody moved, and Slocum laughed softly.|$|R
5|$|Tucker and Allie Clark both {{attempted}} to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of Harry Simpson and Minnie Miñoso made it likely that one or both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> traded or released. Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's wife, Shelley (Mädchen Amick), is at {{home when}} he returns and assaults her. He drives her to the sawmill, ties her up, and rigs a timed device that will set the {{building}} on fire. Meanwhile, Packard meets with recently paroled Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) to give him US$90,000; it is revealed Packard paid Jennings to serve eighteen months in prison. This ensured that neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> implicated {{in the death of}} Packard's husband, from whom she inherited the mill. Jennings later calls Martell to lure her to the mill. As Martell arrives, the device explodes, engulfing the building in flames. At the same time, Johnson attempts to kill Shelley's lover, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), but is shot by Jennings.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} {{connection}} between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective {{were added to the}} game, though Nomura has stated that these scenes are not of a precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, {{the connection between}} both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expanded. Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E

50|$|All of the Me P.1079 {{variants}} {{were small}} planes and none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> {{able to take}} off unassisted. All projected aircraft were provided with retractable skids for landing.|$|R
25|$|All {{existing}} franchises {{would be}} retained, and none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> moved {{outside of their}} metropolitan areas.|$|E
25|$|The Skoda-Kauba Sk P.14 {{project had}} two {{different}} variants. Both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{powered by a}} single Sänger ramjet {{that would give the}} aircraft a speed nearing 1000km/h.|$|E
25|$|Both Christian IV and Wallenstein {{were aware}} that neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to get all their demands through, thus they resorted to secret {{negotiations}} in Güstrow, Mecklenburg.|$|E

60|$|To my mind {{these were}} {{as good as}} dead men. How many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> alive after the rescue that was coming? Not {{more than enough to}} amuse the executioner a short half-hour, certainly.|$|R
25|$|Same-sex {{couples are}} allowed to apply to adopt. If {{applicants}} are approved as suitable to adopt, legally only one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the legal parent of the child.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 2011, Paisley's website {{announced}} that he would release two songs on the soundtrack for the film Cars 2. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a collaboration with British pop singer Robbie Williams.|$|E
25|$|This {{gives some}} measure of privacy and protection; though {{the very nature of}} Culture society would, {{strictly}} speaking, make keeping secrets irrelevant: most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered neither shameful nor criminal. It does allow the Minds in particular to scheme amongst themselves in a very efficient manner, and occasionally withhold information.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's gone scouting," [...] Peter said {{in answer}} to Harold's question. [...] "Ef there are only four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an easy job, but I expect there's more of the red varmints there." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} English grammar, determiners {{were not}} considered a separate part of speech - most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> classed as adjectives. However there are certain differences between determiners and ordinary adjectives (although the boundary is not always entirely clear).|$|R
60|$|The Minor Canon {{instantly}} {{thought that}} if the Griffin entered the town without the people knowing what he came for, some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>be</b> frightened to death, and so he sought to gain time to prepare their minds.|$|R
25|$|Paramount {{put her in}} a thriller, This Gun for Hire (1942); {{her love}} {{interest}} was Robert Preston but she shared more scenes with Alan Ladd and the two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so popular together they would be reteamed in lead roles for three more films. Both had cameos in Star Spangled Rhythm (1942), an all-star Paramount movie.|$|E
25|$|In that month, the Empress of Russia {{died and}} her {{successor}} Paul, who detested the Zubovs and had other {{plans for the}} army, ordered the troops to retreat to Russia. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers {{who took part in}} the campaign: many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> among the conspirators who arranged Paul's murder five years later.|$|E
25|$|McCain has {{repeatedly}} argued that low-skilled immigrant labor {{is necessary to}} supply service roles that native-born Americans refuse. In one widely remarked-upon incident, he insisted to a union group that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour. The audience interrupted with offers and several weeks later demonstrators showed up at his Phoenix office to apply for lettuce picking work.|$|E
60|$|It was {{all very}} good, very kind, yet the very family {{likeness}} to Lilias Merrifield and Jane Mohun made Geraldine think how much more simple in manner one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> without that nouveau riche tone of exultation.|$|R
50|$|Control dependences are {{essentially}} the dominance frontier in the reverse graph {{of the control}} flow graph (CFG). Thus, one way <b>of</b> constructing <b>them,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to construct the post-dominance frontier of the CFG, and then reversing it to obtain a control dependence graph.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Dottie {{contributed to}} Kindercore's first Christmas in Stereo album under the My First Keyboard moniker.

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} 8 more pledged delegates that are {{allocated}} {{based on the}} results of the statewide primary. Five <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at-large delegates to the national convention. These at-large delegates are usually selected by district-level delegates. The other 3 pledged delegates will be Party Leaders and Elected Official (PLEO) delegates. PLEO delegates usually consist of members of the Democratic National Committee, Democratic members of Congress, Democratic Governors, and former Democratic Party leaders.|$|E
25|$|Elisha Hunt {{was one of}} the {{principals}} behind the Bridgeport Manufacturing Company. He planned to process raw cotton and wool into finished goods in Bridgeport and then ship them to southern ports aboard the company's steamboats. Then the steamboats would transport raw cotton to Bridgeport to be processed into finished goods. This synergistic relationship between the manufacturing company and the steamboat company would increase the chances that both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> successful.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Verlinde {{started work}} on his PhD at Utrecht University under the formal {{supervision}} of Bernard de Wit. He worked again with Herman and Dijkgraaf, and in practice the trio supervised themselves. The original arrangement was that only one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> working on the emerging field of string theory, {{but in the end}} all three of them wrote their theses on the subject. In September 1988 Erik defended his PhD thesis, which included the Verlinde formula.|$|E

2500|$|Resistance {{movements}} formed throughout Greece {{not long}} after its occupation.
