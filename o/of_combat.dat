5|$|Maeda {{not only}} taught {{the art of}} judo to Carlos Gracie, but also taught a {{particular}} philosophy about the nature <b>of</b> <b>combat</b> based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists. The book details Maeda's theory that physical combat could {{be broken down into}} distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, and so on. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase <b>of</b> <b>combat</b> that best suited his own strengths. The book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the Gracie approach to combat. The approach included armed versus armed, armed versus unarmed, unarmed, standing (tachiwaza, 立ち技), kneeling (suwariwaza, 座技), and ground work (newaza, 寝技), close quarters (hakuheijugi, 白兵主義), and other forms <b>of</b> <b>combat.</b> It was employed by other proponents of judo ('Kano jiu-jutsu') who, like Maeda, engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally (e.g., Yukio Tani in the United Kingdom from 1905, Mikonosuke Kawaishi in France, and others).|$|E

5|$|After the 96th Infantry Division secured Conical Hill, the 7th Infantry Division {{returned}} to the line. It pushed into positions on the southern Ozato Mura hills, where Japanese resistance was heaviest. It {{was placed on the}} extreme left flank of the Tenth Army, taking the Ghinen peninsula, Sashiki, and Hanagusuku, fending off a series of Japanese counterattacks. Despite heavy Japanese resistance and prolonged bad weather, the division continued its advance until 21 June 1945, when the battle ended, having seen 82 days <b>of</b> <b>combat.</b> The island and surrendering troops were secured by the next day. During the Battle of Okinawa, the soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division killed between 25,000 and 28,000 Japanese soldiers and took 4,584 prisoners. Balanced against this, the 7th Division suffered 2,340 killed and 6,872 wounded for a total of 9,212 battle casualties during 208 days <b>of</b> <b>combat.</b> The division was slated to participate in Operation Downfall as a part of XXIV Corps under the First United States Army, but these plans were scrapped after the Japanese surrendered following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
