25|$|Oakey accepts that Martin Rushent's adept {{sequencing}} {{and programming}} skills brought a professional {{edge to the}} band's sound, and added many new elements and techniques. Oakey, Burden, Wright and Callis set about writing new material, bringing in Sulley and Catherall from Sheffield as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were available. The aim was another album for the Human League within a year. Virgin were at this point lukewarm but keen that the band released another single as soon as possible.|$|E

However, neither poll is necessarily reflective of opinion in Australia with anyone in the world can vote as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> please, and the sample is not random. However, a poll on the Wide World of Sports website revealed 41,000 of the 50,000 respondents did not want Ponting removed.|$|E

25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
500|$|Ally McBeal is an American {{television}} series created by David E. Kelley which {{ran on the}} Fox network from 1997 to 2002. [...] Set in the fictional Boston law firm of Cage, Fish and Associates, the series explores the relationships among various lawyers working at the firm, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> relate to gender-specific issues raised in court cases.

500|$|Each {{prime time}} {{broadcast}} hour {{consists of three}} bouts: the [...] "Challenger" [...] bout, the [...] "Line Jumper" [...] bout, and the [...] "Winner's Defense" [...] bout. Questions start at one point each, with the value increasing by one every 100 seconds. At any time, either contestant may choose to [...] "double" [...] instead of answering; doing so doubles that question's value and forces the opponent to act. A doubled opponent may either answer or [...] "double back," [...] quadrupling the point value and forcing the original contestant to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or fails to act within five seconds, the points are awarded to his/her opponent. Contestants may double as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wish during a bout.|$|E

500|$|During the 15th century, the {{traditional}} {{superiority of the}} common law courts was challenged by ecclesiastical courts and the equitable jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, exercised through the Court of Chancery. These courts were more attractive to the common lawyers because of their informality and the simple method used to arrest defendants. The bills of complaint and subpoena used by the Chancery made court procedure far faster, and from 1460 to 1540 there was a steep {{decline in the number}} of cases in the common law courts, coinciding with a sharp increase in cases in the newer courts. This loss of business was quickly recognised by the King's Bench, which was urged by Fairfax J in 1501 to develop new remedies so that [...] "subpoenas would not be used as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are at present". From 1500 the King's Bench began reforming to increase its business and jurisdiction, with the tide finally turning in their favour by 1550.|$|E

500|$|After signing his contract, Rivera—who spoke no English and {{had never}} left home—flew to the United States and {{reported}} to the [...] Gulf Coast League (GCL) Yankees, a Rookie level minor league affiliate of the New York Yankees. Feeling lonely and homesick, he wrote home to his parents <b>often,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did {{not have access to}} telephones in Puerto Caimito. At that point in his career, scouts considered Rivera to be a [...] "fringe prospect" [...] at best, but he made progress with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in relief, he allowed only 24baserunners and one earned run in 52innings pitched—a 0.17earned run average (ERA). The team permitted Rivera to start the season's final game in order for him to accumulate enough innings pitched to qualify for the league's ERA title (which carried a $500 bonus); his subsequent seven-inning no-hitter [...] "put him on the map with the organization", according to manager Glenn Sherlock. In the offseason, Rivera returned to Panama, where a tip from him to Raybourn led to the Yankees signing a promising local 16-year-old player, Rivera's cousin Rubén. In 1991, Mariano was promoted to the Class A level Greensboro Hornets of the South Atlantic League, where he started 15 of the 29 games he pitched in. Despite a 4–9win–loss record, he recorded a 2.75ERA in innings pitched and struck out 123batters while walking 36batters. New York Yankees manager Buck Showalter took notice of Rivera's strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, calling it [...] "impressive in any league" [...] and saying, [...] "This guy is going to make it." ...|$|E

In 1761, Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, [...] "Then and there the child Independence was born." ...|$|E
