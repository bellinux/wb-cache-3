50|$|Carl Karcher (1917-2008) and {{his wife}} Margaret (1915-2006) founded the {{predecessor}} <b>of</b> <b>Carl's</b> Jr. in 1941, starting as a hot-dog cart in Los Angeles. In 1945, the Karchers moved the short distance to Anaheim, California, and opened their first full-service restaurant, Carl's Drive-In Barbeque. As the restaurant became successful, Carl expanded his business by opening the first two Carl's Jr. restaurants in Anaheim and nearby Brea in 1956. They were so named because they were smaller versions <b>of</b> <b>Carl's</b> original drive-in restaurant. That same year, the chain was officially renamed Carl's Jr. and the fast-food chain took off.|$|R

5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student <b>of</b> <b>Carl</b> Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system <b>of</b> <b>Carl</b> Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
