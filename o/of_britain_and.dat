5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence <b>of</b> <b>Britain,</b> <b>and</b> Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{the late}} Middle Ages (14th and 15th centuries) when the town was at its height of {{commercial}} importance. This was mainly due to the wool trade, a major industry at the time, with the rest <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> Europe, especially with the River Severn and Watling Street as trading routes.|$|E

This allowed military personnel to march through the borough in full uniform, an honour granted by the council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet, CH (29 April 18798 March 1961) was an English {{conductor}} and impresario {{best known}} for his association with the London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic orchestras. He was also closely associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic and Hallé orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and,</b> according to the BBC, was Britain's first international conductor.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1801, the kingdoms <b>of</b> Great <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> Ireland were merged to {{form the}} United Kingdom <b>of</b> Great <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> Ireland.

5|$|The navies <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> France in 1794 were at very {{different}} stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger and stronger, and carried a heavier weight of shot. The largest French ships were three-decker first rates, carrying 110 or 120 guns, against 100 guns on the largest British vessels.|$|E
5|$|Through August and September 1940 the Luftwaffe met the Dowding {{system in}} the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain,</b> <b>and</b> in spite of great effort, failed to defeat Fighter Command. Tizard's letter of 1936 proved prophetic; with their loss during the day, the Luftwaffe moved to a night campaign. The Blitz began in earnest in September.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1800 Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain {{returned}} the Louisiana Territory to France.

5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success, along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E

5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> <b>and</b> wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities {{of the people he}} met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those <b>of</b> <b>Britain,</b> <b>and</b> involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most <b>of</b> <b>Britain,</b> <b>and</b> only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE.

5|$|Born on 14 August 1916 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein {{joined the}} cavalry of the German Wehrmacht in spring of 1937.

He saw action with these units in the Battle of France, Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain,</b> <b>and</b> Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, before he transferred to the night fighter force. He claimed his first aerial victory on the night of 6/7 May 1942. By October 1942, he had accumulated 22 aerial victories for which he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 7 October 1942. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 31 August 1943, for 54 aerial victories.|$|E
