40|$|We {{describe}} a teaching methodology evolved over 25 years for taking incoming students with little farming background to near-consultancy level {{in terms of}} ability to discuss feed supply and demand manipulation with practicing farmers. The methodology is currently used in a double semester course offering to 2 nd year BVSc students at Massey University with positive feedback from students. Component skills such as visual assessment of herbage mass are introduced at the outset. A keystone of the methodology is the provision of student operated 'farmlets' with 16 sheep on 0. 8 ha, where the storage of autumn-surplus feed as increased herbage mass, and release back to animals for winter and early lactation feed is demonstrated. Feed budget calculations for these farmlets in units of MJ metabolisable energy and kg pasture DM/ha/ day promote understanding of animal physiology principles and simulate those of a larger scale commercial farm. As currently offered the module comprises 20 lectures and 5 organised 2 hour farmlet discussion and data collection visits.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{implementation}} of a pilot program aimed at improving student writing in a intermediate macroeconomics course. The Program attempted to reduce what is labelled the expectations gap between student and academic perceptions of what constitutes "good writing". This was done in two ways, Firstly, a range of resources designed to describe the characteristics of good writing was provided to students who were helped to structure their writing according to these characteristics. A series of academic literacy workshops formed the centerpiece of this strategy. Secondly, markers themselves were briefed on these characteristics and an approach to marking based upon them was negotiated. The impact of this program on student writing was very promising. Students who attended the academic literacy workshops performed better in the first of <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments</b> than those who did not, controlling for general ability. These students were less likely to fail and more likely to be awarded a grade at Distinction level or above. The paper also identifies a number of important areas that need to be developed at the next stage of implementation including better integration of published writing huidelines and sample papers into the workshop curriculum, and collection of more qualitative data to suppliment the quantitative evaluations the paper offers. student writing; assessment; expectations; academic literacies; embedded programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quasi-experimental}} research thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of rubric-referenced peer-revision and self-assessment on the writing drafts of 3 rd grade students. A convenience sample of students in existing classrooms engaged in <b>two</b> persuasive <b>writing</b> <b>assignments.</b> The first assignment established a baseline score for comparison purposes. During the second assignment, a peer-revision group and self-assessment group received different interventions that focused on revision guided by a rubric. A third control group did not receive an intervention. Student opinions toward the usefulness of the treatments were also gathered through a questionnaire that was delivered after the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> were complete. The utilization of rubrics to assist peers in revision had a statistically significant, positive effect on student scores during the second persuasive <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> The treatment of rubric-referenced self-assessment did not have an overall positive effect on student scores during the second assignment. The control group’s scores decreased slightly on the second assignment. Almost every student in the peer-revision group thought the treatment was beneficial for student writing. In comparison, a little more than half the students in the self-assessment group considered the treatment to be useful in helping them achieve higher scores or become more proficient writers...|$|R

Evidence supporting their validity and reliability as shortlisting tools has prompted their introduction into the selection processes of other medical specialties. This study explores whether candidate performance <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>written</b> tests predicts performance on subsequent workplace-based simulation exercises. Methods  A prospective analysis of candidate performance (n = 135) during the general practice selection process was undertaken. Candidates were shortlisted using their scores <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>written</b> tests, a clinical problem-solving test (CPST) and a situational judgement test (SJT). Successful candidates then undertook workplace-based simulation exercises at a selection centre (SC). Scores on the CPST and SJT were correlated with SC scores. Regression analysis was undertaken to explore the predictive validity of the CPST and SJT for SC performance. Results  The data show that the CPST and SJT are predictive of performance in workplace-based simulations (r = 0. 598 for the CPST, r = 0. 717 for the SJT). The SJT is a better predictor of SC performance than the CPST (R 2 = 0. 51 versus R 2 = 0. 35).

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to explore the role of {{self-assessment}} in EFL learning in developing lifelong language learning skills and in furthering the development of more comprehensive and thereby fairer assessment practices. The study explores how upper secondary school students perceived their own general and specific writing abilities in relation to syllabus goals and whether these perceptions are affected by self-assessment practices. It also explores students’ and teachers’ experiences of integrating self-assessment into everyday classroom practice. The study is based on the theory that metacognitive skills such as self-regulation and self-monitoring are important for the development of autonomous learning skills. Two teachers and four groups of Swedish upper secondary students participated in the study during one school year. Using grades, students self-assessed the results of <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments,</b> namely a classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> and a <b>written</b> test task. The classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> was also analyzed linguistically by the researcher. The two teachers and eight student focus groups were interviewed about their experiences at the end of the study. The results of the study showed that at the group level students were well able to assess their general writing results in relation to the criterion (the teachers’ grades). At the individual level the results were more variable, partly depending on the type of writing activity assessed and on the amount of practice students had had of self-assessment. Students’ assessments of their writing ability in general showed a stronger relationship with teachers’ grades than did students’ assessments of their results in a particular classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> Students’ assessments tended to become more realistic with practice. The results also showed that the specific writing skills that students at upper secondary school focused on in their writing are spelling and grammar, rather than other skills such as sentence structure, vocabulary, paragraphing and punctuation skills. Students were self-critical with regard to these skills and tended to underestimate their performance in relation to the researchers’ assessment of the same. Students and teachers were positive to the incorporation of self-assessment activities in the EFL writing classroom and saw it as a transferable skill that underpins lifelong learning in other subject areas. The method used in a classroom <b>assignment,</b> where the <b>writing</b> process approach was coupled to self-assessment questions and non-corrective feedback from the teacher, was found to be a practical way of helping students become more aware of their language skills and language levels. Both teachers and students considered student self-assessments as contributing valuable additional information to ordinary tutoring and testing. The implications for EFL writing are that syllabus goals that encourage student responsibility and autonomy are viable and realistic, but students need to practice self-assessment, preferably from an early age, to become adept at employing the approach effectively on a regular basis...|$|R
