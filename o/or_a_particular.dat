5|$|Pilgrimages were {{a popular}} {{religious}} practice throughout the Middle Ages in England, with the tradition {{dating back to}} the Roman period. Typically pilgrims would travel short distances to a shrine <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> church, either to do penance for a perceived sin, or to seek relief from an illness or other condition. Some pilgrims travelled further, either to more distant sites within Britain or, in a few cases, onto the continent.|$|E
5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Defending a {{breeding}} territory is fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E

25|$|A {{resident}} DJ performs at a venue on {{a regular}} basis or permanently. They would perform regularly (typically under an agreement) in a particular discotheque, a particular club, a particular event, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> broadcasting station. Residents have a decisive influence on the club or a series of events. Per agreement with the management or company, the DJ would have to perform under agreed times and dates. Typically, DJs perform as residents for two or three times in a week, for example, on Friday and Saturday. Also, DJs who make a steady income from a venue, are also considered resident DJs. Wynn Nightlife and Hakkasan are well known for hiring high-profile DJs as residents with 'skyrocketing pay'.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista onwards, Terminal Services also {{includes}} a multi-party desktop sharing capability known as Windows Desktop Sharing. Unlike Terminal Services, which creates a new user session for every RDP connection, Windows Desktop Sharing can host the remote session {{in the context of}} the currently logged in user without creating a new session, and make the Desktop, or a subset of it, available over RDP. Windows Desktop Sharing can be used to share the entire desktop, a specific region, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> application. Windows Desktop Sharing can also be used to share multi-monitor desktops. When sharing applications individually (rather than the entire desktop), the windows are managed (whether they are minimized or maximized) independently at the server and the client side.|$|E
25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E
25|$|Masks are a {{familiar}} and vivid element in many folk and traditional pageants, ceremonies, rituals, and festivals, {{and are often}} of an ancient origin. The mask is normally {{a part of a}} costume that adorns the whole body and embodies a tradition important to the religious and/or social life of the community as whole <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> group within the community. Masks are used almost universally and maintain their power and mystery both for their wearers and their audience. The continued popularity of wearing masks at carnival, and for children at parties and for festivals such as Halloween are good examples. Nowadays these are usually mass-produced plastic masks, often associated with popular films, TV programmes, or cartoon characters - they are, however, reminders of the enduring power of pretence and play and the power and appeal of masks.|$|E

25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which may already be occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> road in a marshaling yard. Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E

Some pilgrims travelled further, either to more distant sites within Britain or, in a few cases, onto the continent. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising the value of the historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. By the twelfth century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E
25|$|Jaffe et al. {{were able}} to perform an {{experiment}} in which they discovered how O. bauri recognizes one another. The recognition signal does not pertain to environmental cues, since O. bauri attacked ants which were kept in the colony surrounded by a wire mesh capsule more than the controls, which were kept inside the colony. To further rule out environmental cues as an option, Jaffe et al. fed two different colonies the same diet and fed a single colony two different diets. When the trap jaw ants from the single colony but different diets met they did not attack each other. However, when the ants from two different colonies but same diets met they attacked each other roughly 75% of the time. Additionally, the recognition signal is not a sound <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> behavior since O. bauri is able to recognize dead nestmates. Jaffe et al. was able to determine that the recognition signal must be a type of smell, since ants which were freeze dried or in a plastic wire mesh capsule were never attacked.|$|E
