40|$|Abstract. In general, {{game theory}} {{is used to}} analyze {{interactions}} formally described by an analytical model. In this paper, we describe a methodology to replace the analytical model by a simulation one in order to study more realistic situations. We use this methodology to study how the more-or-less selfishness of agents affects their behaviour. We illustrate our methodology with the case study of a wood supply chain, in which every company {{is seen as an}} agent which may use an ordering strategy designed to reduce a phenomenon called the bullwhip effect. To this end, we assume that every agent utility can be split in two parts, a first part representing the direct utility of agents (in practice, their inventory holding cost) and a second part representing agent social consciousness, i. e., <b>their</b> impact <b>on</b> the rest of the multi-agent system (in practice, their backorder cost). We find that company-agents often apply their collaborative strategy at whatever <b>their</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> of social consciousness. Our interpretation of this specific case study is that every company is so strongly related with one other, that all should collaborate in our supply chain model. Note that a previous paper outlined this methodology and detailed its application to supply chains; our focus is now on the presentation and the extension of the methodology, rather than on its application to supply chains. ...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{the provincial}} {{government}} introduced a ‘publicly managed’ network of Early Years Centers (EYCs). Existing private and nonprofit centers were encouraged to sign contracts to transform themselves into a EYC that had a minimum of 40 children, integrated special needs children, enforced a stricter set of quality standards including higher educational requirements for staff and using a province-wide 0 - to 4 -year-old curriculum, ensured the functioning of a parental advisory committee, and adhered to a uniform wage grid (with defined benefits) and a standardized fee structure established by {{the provincial government}}. The new fee structure kept fees at approximately <b>their</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> for most centers, {{but there will be}} downward pressure on fees in the future as it is now a political decision by the provincial cabinet every time fees rise. Since these EYCs are not owned or operated by the government, financial statements must be sent to the government and a model of public funding was established to ensure that each EYC makes a minimum of 10 % profit if they operated at 91 % capacity. Over two thirds of PEI's childcare centers took the government's initial offer to become an EYC, and a program was created to buy the licenses of for-profit centers and then add their spaces to the EYC network. Further, the new public funding model meant that EYCs were getting substantially higher operating grants from the government than childcare centers that fall outside of the EYC system whose public funding was capped at US$ 15, 000 per year. This difference in funding is meant to encourage centers to come into the EYC system. Under these reforms, the income threshold for when low-income parents become eligible for fully subsidized childcare was raised by US$ 2, 000. Nonetheless, due to heavy spending commitments in other areas, the government began to spend much less on parental subsidies as a percentage of their total 0 to 5 childcare/kindergarten budget.|$|R

Encouraging the development of more general skills in training so that workers who are not able to find work in their field-of-study do not have to downgrade to find work may be advisable as is the determination of vacancies in educational programmes in accordance to the current or expected labour market demand. Moreover, encouraging the development of a qualification framework that takes into account workers’ flexibility may help employers recognise workers’ skills and thus recognise that, for many occupations, a perfect match between field-of-study and occupation is not a requirement for sufficient performance in the job which in turn will allow for graduates from saturated fields to find jobs at their qualification levels in other fields.|$|R
