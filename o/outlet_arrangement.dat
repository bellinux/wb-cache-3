40|$|Advancement in the {{electronics}} industry {{led to the}} development of microscale heat transfer devices which offered high heat transfer coefficient in a compact size. Nevertheless, the heat transfer characteristics were limited by the heat transfer fluids that were used. The recent development of nanotechnology led to the concept of using suspended nanoparticles in heat transfer fluids to improve the heat transfer coefficient of the base fluids. The amount of research done in this particular field is fairly new and limited. Most studies done on microchannel devices and nanofluids recently have reported enhanced heat transfer capabilities and results that challenge traditional theories and limitations on heat transfer devices and fluids. Several important aspects of microchannel heat exchangers that affect the performance such as channel geometry, fluid inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>arrangement,</b> type of construction were discussed together with the reported findings from experimental, numerical and theoretical literatures. This review also focuses on the important aspects of nanofluids such as types, properties and heat transfer characteristics and limitations towards the application of nanofluids.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a rapid {{screening}} tool for assessment of Sustainable Flood Retention Basins (SFRB) to predict corresponding dam failure risks and to identify the SFRB types in the Greater Manchester region. According to a report created for the UK Government, climate change will enhance the risk of failure of 5, 000 dams in the UK. Traditionally, dams {{are considered to be}} safe because they have been built according to high technical standards. However, a great number of dams have been constructed many decades ago and don't meet {{the current state of the}} art dam design guidelines. A rapid expert-based assessment method for dam failure of SFRB supported by neural networks model has been presented. Across the Greater Manchester Area 110 SFRB were assessed for flood storage and the corresponding dam failure risk was assessed for all the dams. The dam failure risk can be estimated using the variables Dam Height, Dam Length, Maximum Flood Water Volume, Flood Water Surface Area, Mean Annual Rainfall (based on Met Office data), Altitude, Catchment size, Urban Catchment Proportion, Forest Catchment Proportion and Managed Maximum Flooding Water Volume. A SFRB can be any of six types. Every type has its own purpose, and this can cause confusion and arguments between stakeholders and planners, so a system to clearly identify the type of SFRB is required. Cluster analysis was used to predict the six types of SFRB for the Greater Manchester region. Only eight essential variables were used to do this, Dam height, Dam Length, <b>Outlet</b> <b>Arrangement</b> and Operation, Maximum Flood Water Volume, Flotsam Cover, Flood Protection, Long Term Water Storage and Drinking Water Provision. These variables that are used are of great importance when characterising SFRB and distinguishing between SFRB types. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The bottom charged side {{spillway}} is a {{new concept}} of spillway in which the excess water is spilled from the bottom level which is sediment rich water and the cleanest quality of water {{is sent to the}} turbine. It is different in a sense that it will remove sediments as well while getting rid of the excess water different than the conventional spillways which will spill the cleanest quality of water. The concept was developed by Professor Haakon Støle and so far not much work has been done concerning the concept. The main objective of the present study is to prepare a design guideline for bottom charged side spillway. Hydraulic Model Study Different calculations have been done for the design of canal, intake, surface charged spillway and bottom charged spillway considering different considerations. Detail design drawings were prepared based on design and model was constructed at NTNU/SINTEF lab. The present model of bottom charged spillway consists of the following modules. • Inlet arrangement. • Upstream canal section. • Surface charged side spillway section. • Bottom charged side spillway section. • Downstream canal section. • <b>Outlet</b> <b>arrangement.</b> • Instrumentation and measuring arrangements. Since the study is of a new concept, there has been no real prototype for the model but for ease of calculation and making the study more realistic all the calculations has been started considering some imaginary values. The prototype dimensions were then converted to model dimensions using Froude’s model law. Model Test Result It is observed from the study that the bottom charged spillway can be an efficient alternative for effectively spilling the excess water and parallel flushing of the sediments as well. The design of the model was conducted using different approaches. Since not much literature was available about the concept, some assumptions were made to proceed the design. Different approaches of general spillway approach, submerged side orifice approach and side spillway approaches were applied with modifications for bottom entry losses. The attempt were made to figure the relation for more accurate calculation. Some relations concerning the calculation of bottom entry losses were derived based on the model study but these need to be refined for better results. The most favorable approach by the model test was found to be the approach of side spillway with additional effect of bottom orificelosses. The calculation with side spillway approach gave less variation with the actual observed values. Downstream spillway end point was considered as the control point for the design. The depth and the Froude number at this point is the starting data for the design. The variation in the nature of flow among the surface charge spillway and bottom charge spillway was not observed. Hence {{it can be said that}} the bottom charge spillway will not add disturbances to the flow in canal. There is development of high turbulence at the spill pool due to which the flushing of the sediments may not be a problem. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} thermal environmental performance of atria in the tropics, with special reference to Malaysia. The main design problems {{that affect the}} thermal and energy performance in existing Malaysian atria are overlighting and overheating due to the direct application of western top-lit atrium roof form. As such, 'this research proposed the side-lit atrium form which aimed at controlling direct sunlight {{as a way to}} improve thermal and energy performance of atria in the tropics. Based on the proposed conceptual atrium form, this research examined quantitatively some of the low energy design features and ventilation strategies that can possibly contribute to a better indoor thermal environmental performance of atria in the tropics. The ultimate aim of this research is to propose design principles and guidelines for new low-energy atria in the tropics The combined research methods are as follows: developing a conceptual low energy atrium form based on the vernacular design features to be used for computer modelling studies; carrying out field measurement and monitoring on an existing atrium building which provides validation data for dynamic thermal simulation program TAS; modelling exercise on the same monitored building using dynamic thermal modelling to develop confidence in correctly modelling thermal stratification within the multi-level atrium; employing dynamic thermal modelling to model representative atrium. forms (i. e. both side-lit and top-lit model) and examine quantitatively the effects of some of the key design parameters (i. e. wall-to-roof void area, roof overhangs, and internal solar blinds) on the thermal comfort and energy performance in atria due to both full natural ventilation and pressurised ventilation; and utilising computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to complement the dynamic thermal simulation results, and to investigate quantitatively the thermal and ventilation performance within the atrium well in response to the changes of design parameters (i. e. varying the inlet to outlet opening area ratio and <b>outlet's</b> <b>arrangement).</b> The research findings supported the research proposition and demonstrated the effectiveness of the side-lit form as a way to improve the thermal and energy performance with regard to users' thermal comfort in atria in the tropics. The main,findings from both dynamic thermal simulation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are as follows: full natural ventilation strategy is not viable for Malaysian atria; both sufficiently high wall-to-roof void area and extending high-level internal solar blinds can greatly improve the atrium's thermal performance particularly on occupied levels; sufficiently wide roof overhangs above the clerestory areas of the side-lit atrium form generally improves the thermal and energy performance within the central atrium throughout the yea~; reasonably comfortable thermal environment on occupied levels of a low-rise atrium can be achieved by only supplying cooler air at low-level with sufficient ventilation rate; sufficiently higher inlet to outlet opening area ratio can improve the thermal performance on the occupied levels; and with equal inlet and outlet opening area, changing the <b>outlet's</b> <b>arrangement</b> (i. e. location and arrangement) would not significantly affect the atrium's thermal performance.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 158 - 169. Secondary {{settling}} tanks (SSTs) form {{a crucial part}} of wastewater treatment plants. Besides having to produce the separation of suspended solids and clarified effluent the secondary settling tank is used to concentrate and recycle the settled sludge to the biological reactor. The efficiency of the biological reactor in the waste water treatment system is determined by the efficiency of this final clarifying process. Hydrodynamic models have been developed for simulating secondary {{settling tanks}} in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the complex flow patterns in these tanks, and to make design and optimization of the SST internal features possible. These models use mainly the finite volume method. This thesis is concerned with the development and implementation of a finite element approach to the simulation of flows in SSTs. Although it is nowadays also possible to realise an unstructured grid within the FVM, the power of the finite element method (FEM) lies in its higher flexibility in fitting irregular domains and in providing local grid refinement. Generally, unstructured mesh procedures with the FVM require essential, additional orthogonality corrections, which affect the accuracy of the solution, and these corrections increase the computational cost due to the additional computations and increased iteration requirements. Structured mesh discretization may offer significantly shorter computation time. The FEM is therefore convenient for handling arbitrarily shaped domains and adaptation of complex internal features of SSTs, such as inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} water in a {{rainwater}} tank {{is a matter of}} much speculation, however several techniques can be used to protect and enhance the quality. If these procedures are followed, tank water should conform to the World Health Organisation’s “Low Risk ” category. The primary contamination pathways are via vectors (such as lizards or frogs) directly entering the tank and via inlet water. This first of these is easily blocked for larger animals by screening all inlets and overflows. A more important path is via the water entering from the roof. As water passes through the air, onto the roof and flows to the tank, it picks up contamination and carries it into the tank. The contaminants tend to adhere to solid matter that is washed along with the water flow and can be filtered using simple techniques. There is also substantial evidence that water quality improves with time, therefore any system that prevents contaminated water from interacting with “aged ” water in the tank will also enhance water quality. This paper discusses inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>arrangements</b> for water tanks that can easily be incorporated in low-income countries, yet will substantially enhance water quality both by preventing contaminants from entering the tank and by aiding natural water purification occurring in the tank.

40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a rotary mechanical feeder, which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized lock hopper or paste feeder methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different <b>outlet</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the outlet seal at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|R

Retail gasoline prices follow a fixed weekly pattern, where retail outlets all over Norway simultaneously increase their prices to the same level every Monday at noon. Consequently, the sharp price increase is tied to time rather than the current price level.

40|$|Sediment induced wear of hydro-turbines {{has been}} a major problem in {{utilizing}} the water resources in sediment loaded rivers around the world. The problems are more sever in Himalayan Rivers, which favor high head plants but are highly loaded with sediment. During wet season, there is ample of water available in these rivers carrying high concentration of sediment. The generation efficiency of the turbines decreases drastically when subjected to high sediment loads of monsoon season and maintenance costs are increased. Thus, besides the potential for high power generation with respect to the availability of water, the generation capability is reduced due to the decrease in the efficiency of the turbines. A considerable amount of research has been carried out to minimize these sediment related problems in power plants. A research on using hydro-cyclones for sediment handling in Himalayan River has been carried out by Hari Pandit (Pandit, 2009) in his Ph. D work. He worked on improving the performance of the hydro-cyclone by improving the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the hydro-cyclones. However, headloss over the efficient hydro-cyclone is quite significant which is in general not affordable by the existing power plants, hence making it impractical for application. A new concept called “Throttle Trap concept” has been developed by Professor Haakon Støle to overcome issues of application of a Hydro-cyclone based on its head requirement. It involves increasing velocity in a section of a waterway to such level that the increase in the velocity head and simultaneously decrease in pressure head is high enough to generate the head required in operating the hydro-cyclone. The pressure head is then gradually regained with decrease in the velocity and the kinetic energy is transformed back to potential energy in the waterway downstream. Thus the “Throttled Trap concept” involves splitting of these diment rich bottom flow from a waterway, process it in the hydro-cyclones and then finally return the processed flow to the waterway. The Throttled trap system can be placed anywhere in a pressurized waterway of a plant where pressure line above it is sufficiently higher than the head required by the hydro-cyclones to operate. In this thesis work a theoretical study on the hydraulic features of the concept has been carried out. Based on an in operation reference project, the Jhimruk Hydropower Plant of Nepal, an excel spreadsheet model has been prepared for preliminary dimensioning of the concept. Two different layout of the Throttle Trap concept has been prepared where it is applied to penstock and to tunnel setup. A model study on the concept has been carried out for the throttled trap in a penstock setup. The concept is functional based on the observations made in the model. The theoretically expected pattern of pressure drop in the pipe was achieved as expected. However, the headloss over the system was relatively high. The headloss over the branch flow was substantially high to achieve the head required by the cyclone to operate. Moreover, thepressure drop generated over the throttled trap system was not found to be fully utilized overthe hydro-cyclone. Based on these observations, modifications were made in improving the hydraulics of the system and optimizing the geometry for better utilization of the generated pressure drop under modification I and II respectively. The modifications improved the performance of the system generating an overall efficiency of around 19 % and the delivery efficiency of the branch flow arrangement to be about 78 %. However, there is still room for improvement and modifications have been suggested for further studies. The concept of locating Throttle Trap concept in a tunnel setup also seems to be very promising in regards to safety working at low pressure and flexibility in working on it relative to the existing embedded penstocks subjected to high pressure. However, the geological considerations are to be dealt with in detail. The selection of the best location of the concept is based on the available head in the waterway and the flexibility in working on it. Further studies are therefore recommended on the concept in a tunnel setup. This study involves only the steady state of flow in the waterway, hence further studies on the realistic scenarios are recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} Dutch democracy, once {{considered}} a highly stable product of cooperation, compromise and consensus-seeking practices across socioeconomic and sociocultural lines, has changed. Whereas the accessibility and levels (not forms) of participation have changed little, autocratically led protest parties have won ground {{and in the}} polls draw support from a stable 15 % – 17 % of the electorate. Corruption prevention in politics, especially regarding party finances, appears to fall under the bar of international standards. Political rhetoric has grown increasingly polarized (or politicized) as the political middle is waning and extreme positions on either side are on the rise. The Dutch media landscape remains highly pluralistic, {{although there are some}} concerns about the growing concentration of media ownership, a situation aggravated by the present financial economic crisis, rapid commercialization, and international ownership of national media <b>outlets.</b> In legal <b>arrangements,</b> citizens‟ right to privacy is subject to pressures from the information revolution and the massive use of information technology (IT) in all kinds of policy fields, primarily relating to internal and external security. In addition, some conspicuous miscarriages of justice have spawned a public debate {{on the quality of the}} justice system, including the need for a special court charged with handling mistrials. Anti-terrorism and integration policies have put considerable pressure on the exercise of basic political liberties, such as the freedoms of speech, religion and press as well as protection against unreasonable search and seizure actions. Tough immigration laws have come under international legal scrutiny, in particular where the rights of children and family reunion are concerned. In short, although the quality of Dutch democracy remains satisfactory, it has suffered several blows in several areas. Policy-specific performance during the Balkenende IV government – the coalition cabinet formed by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Labor (PvdA) and Christian Union (CU) parties – was in general incremental, save for the proposal to phase-in an extension of the pension age to 67 that was adopted by the cabinet in 2009. Policy performance in matters relating to internal and external safety remained adequate, although at rising public cost. The Health Care Insurance Act (Zvw) of 2006 was continued, although its impact on cost control issues and enhancing market-like competition between health care providers remains unclear. Stagnation continues to characterize environmental, research and development, and innovation policies alike. No changes have been made to education Netherlands report SGI 2011 | 4 policy, although it is now generally judged to be in crisis. Serious concerns have been raised about the lack of good teachers, literacy and numeracy skills among elementary students, and high attrition rates at all levels of education. As is the case in most other European countries, the financial and banking crisis (followed by the euro crisis) has proven detrimental to economic policy performance, which negatively affects prospects in almost all other policy areas. Strategic Outlook The long-term viability of the D utch polity depends on the acumen with which the three following challenges are treated: the state‟s weakened fiscal position; facilitating technology innovation in order to develop an ecologically modernized and sustainable economy; and societal integration and coherence. (1) Improving the state‟s weakened fiscal position. The state‟s financial problems can in large part be attributed to recent bailouts of Dutch banks and financial businesses, as well as individual euro zone countries and the euro itself. An effective long-term solution to these fiscal problems therefore requires (domestic as well as European-level) reforms involving stricter regulation and oversight in order to improve risk-management. The Dutch government must also undertake substantive reforms in the banking and financial sector. (2) Improve technology innovation in order to ensure an ecologically modernized and sustainable economy. The Dutch government must invest more wisely in efforts targeting the transition to renewable and alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar energy. The government will also need to pursue a structural reform of the education system, which is in a state of crisis. (3) Facilitate societal integration and coherence while implementing flexicurity policies. The Dutch welfare state urgently needs reforms that ensure continued investment in human capital while protecting workers and families from the brunt of structural adjustments. Opportunities for combining work and family life ought to be expanded and improved. The pension system and the moribund state of its financial underpinning must also undergo reforms. Social coherence will not be advanced through tighter immigration and citizenship policies. Instead, policies focused on urban and residential area renewal should be sustained through adequate funding. Netherlands report SGI 2011 | 5 A sound, functional democracy requires clearly structured forms of issue-specific, interactive policy-making in which citizens‟ voices are represented. In tripartite governance structures like that of the Netherlands, the primacy of politics vis-à-vis markets and civil society ought to be reconfirmed. Where possible, politics should respect the self-regulation of citizen life and markets. But as the only institution capable of regulating tripartite relations, the state must also live up to its responsibilities in maintaining the framework in which democratic decision-making takes place...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to characterise the marketing system in which smallholder dairy farmers (SDF) in Kenya operate and to examine how transaction costs (TCs) and market outlet risks (MORs) influence market participation of the farmers. The study begins with a critical review of the evolution of the country's dairy marketing policies, right from the introduction of commercial dairying in the country at the beginning of the 20 th century to the period of the study. Economic actors, including organisations, receive special attention as the prime instigators of institutional changes. The importance of history in conditioning future institutional structures makes such a review a fundamental element in placing the prevailing marketing system in proper perspective. The review shows that Kenya's dairy industry has been a very dynamic industry that has evolved as circumstances are altered. Specifically, the review identifies three major policy turning points, triggered by a great variety of causes all of which generated conditions that both facilitated and constrained SDF production and market activities. The review also illustrates that the behavior of organizations and their relationships with the central administration can set the conditions for an entire industry's development. It also provides a useful starting point for the core {{objective of}} the 'study, which is based on the analysis of primary farm- and market- level longitudinal and cross-sectional data using appropriate statistical and econometric methods. High perishability and the daily pattern of flow of milk output (at least within a lactation period), which necessitate repetitive tasks of milk sales activities, are the principal sources of TCs and MORs associated with sale of milk. However, while the TCs and MORs inherently arising from these aspects of milk production and marketing potentially face all dairy farmers, the characteristics pose greater challenges to the SDF. This is due primarily to quantity constraints associated with small marketable surpluses and because of market accessibility problems characterising most rural areas. Analysis of the primary data reveals that an average SDP in the study area marketed about 9 litres of milk per day and was located about 4. 3 kilometres away from a major road. Together, quantity constraint and market accessibility are found to have significant influence on SDF's market participation with respect to choice of market outlet. The study reveals that the SDP in the study area operated in a marketing system where: (i) feasible market outlet alternatives varied widely with accessibility to major roads and consumption centers; (ii) size of household's marketable surplus played a significant role in influencing both the choice of market outlet and SDP decisions on whether to sell to cash-sale or to credit markets, and what proportion of milk to allocate to each; and (iii) unit milk prices differed widely with market <b>outlet</b> and contractual <b>arrangements</b> with respect to time pattern of payment. A price decomposition model based on the ordinary least squares (OLS) method is used to make comparison of values across the observed modes of payment. The results present strong evidence that transactions involving regular payments by fixed schedules offered lower unit prices relative to spot-cash transactions. In the context of the study, the price differentials are interpreted as revealing compensating differentials across the contractual arrangements with regards to market search, market assurance and savings utility. Spot-cash markets for the highly perishable commodity expose the SDF to greater risks of non-sale. On the other hand, contractual arrangements involving payments at regular fixed schedules implicitly define repeat contracts that 'routinize' milk sales/delivery tasks, offer greater assurance to the farmer for subsequent sales, as well as creating savings utility. Relative to spot-cash prices, the respective price differentials indicate the amount (in cash per litre of milk) the SDF were, on the overall, willing to sacrifice for the benefits of the corresponding flows of payments. The model results suggest that fortnightly payments attracted by far the largest sacrifice of 18 %, next highest sacrifice (J 0 %) was for cash-repeat payments followed by monthly (7 %) and least was weekly payments (5 %). Further analysis suggests that household-specific socio-economic factors had significant conditioning effects on preferences for the modes of payment. Results from applications of random-effects logit and Tobit models show that, ceteris paribus, younger, more educated producers were more likely to accept sales on credit. Conversely, older producers with more experience but less formal education were more likely to sell for cash rather than credit. The results also suggest that the desired liquidity flow was an important criterion for market choice behaviour. Where liquidity flow was required in lumps to match lumpy expenditures, on-credit sales were preferred. A basic conclusion of the study is that smallholder's market-outlet choice behaviour is not based on the levels of price alone; it is also influenced by some other important contractual elements of exchange. The study recommends that comparisons of producer's market-outlet choice behaviour should be based on sound and objective theoretical and empirical analysis of differentials in benefits derived by the producer from the different contractual arrangements offered by the existing marketing system. In particular to milk marketing, this study shows that a particularly important contractual element relates to the time pattern of payments. The findings of the study have important implications for the basic structure of the first point of sale of milk under liberalized market conditions. Differentiated producer-preferences for modes of payments, coupled with buyers' need to mini mise TCs involved in procuring milk from SDF, imply that the first point of sale of milk will continue to be characterised by a wide range of marketoutlets, each tailoring its major marketing strategy towards one of SDFs' preferred modes of payment. This further implies that mode of payment is a potentially powerful competitive tool as opposed to offering generalised sales arrangements for all sellers. Participation of Dairy Farmers' Co-operative Societies (DFCS) seems to be on the decline. Collective marketing by SDFs nonetheless remains potentially useful in reducing TCs and MORs. This is clearly demonstrated by a spontaneous emergence of new organisational forms of collective milk marketing based on smaller-sized groups of self-selected farmers as opposed to the large-sized DFCS based on open membership. Such institutional innovation clearly implies that exogenously prescribed organisational structures may not be as effective and responsive as farmer-evolved processes, such as learning and incremental innovations. Therefore, government policy must promote an environment that induces smallholder farmers to make incremental innovations in organisational types and governance structures appropriate for the diverse market outlet types and modes of payment...|$|R
