5|$|As Austria {{was short}} <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> {{military}} commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E

The main concepts: The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> and The Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> are described in the theoretical part. At first, the author defines the concept of The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> furthermore she describes diferences between The Intensity and Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> in order to implement both concepts into the context of Experiential Education. The second chapter is aimed at Experiential Courses, their background and history, principles of Experiential Education and Dramaturgy of Experiential Education Courses. The main part of the thesis is the third chapter, which is devoted to quantitative-qualitative research. This research is focused on The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> evaluated by the participants, which the author further compares with The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> intended by instructors.

5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, Maria Theresa {{created the}} council of state, {{composed}} of the state chancellor, {{three members of the}} high nobility and three knights, which served as a committee <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> people who advised her. The council of state lacked executive or legislative authority, but nevertheless showed the difference between the form of government employed by Frederick II of Prussia. Unlike the latter, Maria Theresa was not an autocrat who acted as her own minister. Prussia would adopt this form of government only after 1807.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> has two sides: {{it implies}} that {{knowledge}} is acquired through the senses, and {{it implies that}} knowledge is acquired over time.

5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E

Only Anderson and one other man, {{the son of a}} Confederate general, continued to charge after the others retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.|$|E
