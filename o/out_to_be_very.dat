5|$|In February 1334 Montagu {{was sent}} on a {{commission}} to Edinburgh, to demand Edward Balliol's homage to Edward. In the great summer campaign of 1335, it was Montagu who provided the largest English contingent, with 180 men-at-arms and 136 archers. He was well rewarded for his contributions: after the Scots {{had been forced to}} cede the Lowlands, Montagu was granted the county of Peeblesshire. He was also allowed to buy the wardship of Roger Mortimer's son Roger for 1000 marks, a deal that turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> lucrative for Montagu. At this point, however, the fortunes were turning for the English in Scotland. Montagu campaigned in the north again in 1337, but the siege of Dunbar met with failure. Following the abortive attempt in Scotland, Edward III {{turned his attention to the}} continent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> friendly, helping out Marge {{with the family}} chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable {{that he is a}} better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E

25|$|These algebras, called {{geometric}} algebras, form {{a systematic}} set, which turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful in physics problems which involve rotations, phases, or spins, notably in classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory and relativity.|$|E
25|$|If one starts {{looking for}} these adjoint pairs of functors, they turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> common in {{abstract}} algebra, and elsewhere as well. The example section below provides evidence of this; furthermore, universal constructions, {{which may be}} more familiar to some, give rise to numerous adjoint pairs of functors.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} groups {{isolated}} by von Neumann {{in the course}} of study of Banach–Tarski phenomenon turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> important for many areas of mathematics: these are amenable groups, or groups with an invariant mean, and include all finite and all solvable groups. Generally speaking, paradoxical decompositions arise when the group used for equivalences in the definition of equidecomposability is not amenable.|$|E

500|$|In 2010 spring training, Wilson {{was asked}} {{whether or not he}} thought himself one of baseball's elite closers. In what would turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> prophetic quote, he replied: ...|$|R
25|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool for describing real quantum systems, as it turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, {{we can use the}} known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.|$|E
25|$|Related, yet {{different}} was {{the notion}} of male beauty. When a boy at young age turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> handsome, he would be barred from heavy work, instead he would be pampered, his skin rubbed with oils, his hair meticulously taken care of, and so on. The idea was that in this way he would grow up to such a beauty {{that he would be}} irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.|$|E
25|$|When Broad {{returned}} he instantly made {{an impact}} with numerous wickets but turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> expensive. With {{his first game}} getting figures of 4–71, England suffered defeat by 112 runs. Broad improved on his economy rate in the 4th ODI with figures of 2–30 from 9.5 overs. This backed up James Anderson who took 5–23. The final game was rained off before a ball was bowled to leave England with a 2–1 victory and only the second team to win a one-day series vs South Africa in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|With their {{patchwork}} secondary, the Patriots ranked just 17th {{in passing}} yards allowed (3,400) and 22nd in completions allowed (315). However, they did rank 7th in interceptions (20) and 10th in fewest passing touchdowns allowed (18). Most importantly, New England continued to win despite the injuries. Brown actually turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective playing {{as a defensive}} back, ranking second on the team with 3 interceptions. Safety Rodney Harrison was also an impact player, leading the team with 138 tackles while also recording 3 sacks and 2 interceptions.|$|E
25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in {{innovative ways to}} reach out to the voters. Although SMS had been used during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice was the way {{to reach out to}} the rural community as they could speak their language. This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> interesting as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E
25|$|Another {{point of}} view, which turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful {{to analyze the}} algorithm, is that row {{reduction}} produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations {{may be viewed as}} the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a Frobenius matrix. Then {{the first part of the}} algorithm computes an LU decomposition, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.|$|E

50|$|The 2007-08 season turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> disappointing one for Hibernians, as {{the club}} {{finished}} {{the first phase}} of the season in the relegation pool. They finished the season in seventh position.|$|R

25|$|The {{main problem}} was the fixed fee which, {{strictly}} interpreted by Attorney-General’s Department ultimately led to a serious decline in standards from which the program has never fully recovered. Once the pioneer celebrants became diluted with new appointments idealism was only sustained by the minority. Attitudes developed with many celebrants which turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> destructive. Realising they received the same remuneration if they spent time and care {{in the preparation of}} a marriage, or if they did not, many provided the absolute minimum for the marrying couple. To make matters worse, the fixed fee, in a period of high inflation, declined in value, which further exacerbated the problem.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 1926 Jääkarhu {{was ready}} for first sea trials in the North Sea. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the {{delivery}} of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 had turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> severe. Despite {{the best efforts of}} existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of Utö {{at the edge of the}} Archipelago Sea.|$|E
25|$|However, the two batted {{responsibly}} together, even {{finding the}} time to hit a few sixes – most of them off Harbhajan Singh, who was carted for 55 runs in nine overs. In sixteen overs, the pair added 91 runs, and put New Zealand back on track. There were good scores from Chris Cairns, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori too, and New Zealand put the new super sub rule to its full use and placed all-rounder Andre Adams at number 11 in the batting order. They finished on 215 all out, McCullum holing out with a straight hit that fell short of the boundary into Rahul Dravid's waiting hands, but his 49 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> crucial.|$|E
60|$|Gunrig's wound turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> severe one--much more so {{than had}} been at first supposed--for the arrow had {{penetrated}} one of his lungs, and, breaking off, had left the head in it.|$|R
50|$|December was a busy month, with matches crammed {{together}} {{at the end of}} the month. It turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> unsuccessful period for Fulham, as they took just two points from a possible 18.|$|R

25|$|The Second Bank of the United States {{was closed}} during Noble's first term, leaving the state without a bank to hold {{government}} deposits or to supply paper money. There {{had been no}} banks operating in Indiana for a decade, so with no alternative to the situation the General Assembly passed a bill to create the Bank of Indiana. Noble had not taken {{a position on the}} bill, but signed it into law. The bank eventually turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> profitable {{and one of the most}} important acts of his time in office. Noble also oversaw the creation of plans to build Indiana's third statehouse in 1831. The building was completed in 1835, and he also oversaw the move of the government's offices.|$|E
25|$|During the Pool B {{match between}} Ireland and Zimbabwe, Sean Williams {{was caught by}} Ireland's John Mooney in a close run chase. Mooney was {{extremely}} close to the boundary and eight different television replays were inconclusive as to whether his foot had touched the boundary rope. Meanwhile, Williams had walked and the umpires signaled him out. Zimbabwe went on to lose the game and were knocked out of the tournament as a result. In their last game, Zimbabwe lost to India. Zimbabwe finished their world cup campaign with just one win over UAE in the first round. Despite this, Zimbabwe turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> competitive and suffered four of the closest losses in the preliminary round of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In the 2002–03 season, West Ham struggled. Řepka {{had serious}} {{disciplinary}} problems amassing ten yellow cards and one red card in thirty-two league appearances. Don Hutchison turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> injury-prone {{on his second}} spell with the club, playing only ten league games that season. West Ham were bottom at Christmas {{and at that time}} no team had ever avoided relegation from that position. Despite the January signings of Rufus Brevett, Lee Bowyer on a short-term deal, and Les Ferdinand, Roeder was unable to halt the team's slump. Roeder had a dispute with striker Paolo Di Canio after he substituted Di Canio in a match against West Bromwich Albion. In April 2003, Roeder suffered a brain tumour and was replaced by Trevor Brooking for the final three games of the season. Despite a late rally, West Ham were relegated with a record number of 42 points.|$|E

50|$|As Alfandari's health worsened, {{to avoid}} {{disappearance}} of his language, he founded a second, more serious organization: the Academy of Neo (Akademio de Neo), {{with the task}} of regulating, nurturing and spreading the language; but the organization turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> successful. Progress <b>was</b> cut short by Alfandari's death in 1969 and the language was mostly forgotten.|$|R
60|$|When {{the evening}} was pretty well advanced, the violin was sent for and tuned, and Stiff turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> fair player of Scotch reels; so the party laid aside their pipes, cleared the floor, and began to dance.|$|R
