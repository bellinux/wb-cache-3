25|$|The head is {{specialized}} {{for receiving}} sensory information and for feeding. It has {{eyes and a}} pair of long, many-segmented antennae. The antennae are important for detecting host odors, as well as <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> breeding sites where females lay eggs. In all mosquito species, the antennae of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the females.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{chemicals}} coated on the nests are {{equivalent to that}} present in adult P. dominula bodies, young wasps learn this chemical template {{in the very early}} state of the adult life to later on be able to distinguish their nest mates from non-nest mates. The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight CHCs is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults. Adults are also able to distinguish <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> their own colonial larval CHCs from those of foreign colonys.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> feces {{is due to}} bacterial action. Gut flora produce compounds such as indole, skatole, and thiols (sulfur-containing compounds), {{as well as the}} inorganic gas hydrogen sulfide. These are {{the same}} compounds that are responsible for the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> flatulence. Consumption of foods prepared with spices may result in the spices being undigested and adding to the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> feces.|$|R
40|$|Psychological {{interrelation}} {{between the}} base odors (according to Amoore) and the base emotional states {{of human beings}} (according to Ekman) is established. The subjects were offered samples <b>of</b> the basic <b>odors.</b> Their task was to associate these <b>odors</b> with one <b>of</b> the proposed basic emotions. The analysis of variance showed the significant association <b>of</b> putrid <b>odor</b> with the emotion <b>of</b> disgust, the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> mint with the emotion of surprise, and the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> musk with the emotion <b>of</b> anger. Other <b>odors</b> can cause two or three emotions. Based on the theoretical analysis, the article proposes to associate flowery odor with the emotion <b>of</b> joy, the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> fruit with the emotion of pleasure, the pungent odor with the emotion of fear, and the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> camphor with the emotion of sadness. Hypothesis {{of the existence of}} olfactory-emotional language allowing to create the emotional tone <b>of</b> the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> any object, is offered...|$|R
60|$|Some pancake flour {{had been}} brought along, and soon the appetizing <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> the cakes, along with the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> {{steaming}} coffee, filled the Lodge. Then came a call {{from one of the}} bedrooms, and, sure enough, it was Fred speaking.|$|R
25|$|Although {{bilateral}} {{activation of}} the brain has been seen with unilateral stimulation (accomplished by placing a stimulus under one nostril only), the activation seen is not exactly equal in both hemispheres. Different {{parts of the brain}} are involved in olfactory memory, depending on what type of memory is being processed (e.g. implicit memory-habituation or explicit memory-recognition) and this is evident in the results of explicit and implicit tasks of memory. Studies have shown that the left hemisphere is activated during verbal semantic retrieval of odor-related memories, while the right hemisphere shows activation during non-verbal retrieval of semantic odor-related information. Much overlap does occur between regions, however. Information of <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> a semantic nature is distributed across both sides of the brain, although the right hemisphere is more involved in the processing of odor quality and previous encounter of the stimulus than the left. Neural plasticity is also an important part of olfaction, as different experiences may result in alterations of both cortical and subcortical circuitry in the brain.|$|E

The smell of pine needles and flowers and herbs and freshly turned dirt and all the other {{delicate}} <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> the forest are drowned in the stench of gasoline. The feeling of wind blowing in the face and of soft ground under foot are all lost." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the farming}} industry, {{environmental}} concerns over air pollution lead to research {{aimed at reducing}} the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> manure. A body of evidence emerged that increased sulfur containing amino acid content of feed increased the offensive <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> feces and flatus produced by livestock.|$|R
50|$|The {{taste and}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> Psilocybe stuntzii are farinaceous.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of oxygen, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids; this {{gives rise to the}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> rotten eggs and contributes to the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> flatulence.|$|R
2500|$|Young raw Pu'erh:The ideal liquors {{should be}} {{aromatic}} {{with a light}} but distinct <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> camphor, rich herbal notes like Chinese medicine, fragrance floral notes, hints of dried fruit aromas such as preserved plums, and should exhibit only some grassy notes {{to the likes of}} fresh sencha. Young raw pu'er may sometimes be quite bitter and astringent, but should also exhibit a pleasant mouthfeel and [...] "sweet" [...] aftertaste, referred to as gān (甘) and húigān(回甘).|$|E
2500|$|Decorated with a {{high-gloss}} {{paint to}} reflect as much light as possible, the fireplace features a rustic mantelpiece called the [...] "Eighth of January". It was carved by {{a veteran of}} the Battle of New Orleans; he worked on the mantelpiece on each annual anniversary of the battle until he finished on January 8, 1839. Jackson installed the piece on January 8, 1840. Adjacent to the dining room is a pantry and storage room that leads to an open passageway to the kitchen. This was built separate from the house to prevent risk of fire to the main house, as well as to exclude the noise, heat and <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> cooking. To the right of the entrance hall, and accessed via a side hall, are two bedrooms; these were occupied by President Jackson and his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. In the west wing is a spacious library and office used by Jackson and others to manage the plantation.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between chemical {{structure and the}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> white flowers in {{a new series of}} tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl derivatives of substituted cyclohexanols and phenols was investigated, with particular reference to the stereochemistry of the odorants. Several of these compounds exhibit a pleasant floral <b>odor,</b> two <b>of</b> them being very similar in their odor profiles to hydroxycitronellal, taken as a reference for the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> white flowers. They represent interesting alternatives to the currently used additives for cosmetics and detergents...|$|R

60|$|Ormsgill smiled, though {{once more}} {{the smell of the}} wilderness, the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> lilies and spices, and the sourness of corruption, was in his nostrils.

60|$|A mile or {{two from}} the city he entered a forest and here at last he felt such a measure of safety as he never knew in open spaces or in cities. The forest and the jungle were his birthright. No {{creature}} that went upon the ground upon four feet, or climbed among the trees, or crawled upon its belly had any advantage over the ape-man in his native heath. As myrrh and frankincense were the dank <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> rotting vegetation in the nostrils of the great Tarmangani. He squared his broad shoulders and lifting his head filled his lungs with the air that he loved best. The heavy fragrance of tropical blooms, the commingled <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> the myriad-scented life of the jungle went to {{his head with a}} pleasurable intoxication far more potent than aught contained in the oldest vintages of civilization.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} to the {{entrance}} to the private apartments. These were enclosed by magnificent hangings, which were drawn aside by two attendants as he approached them. The walls were here entirely hidden by hangings, and the floor covered with a thick carpeting of richly-dyed cotton stuff. The air was heavy with <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> perfumes.|$|E
