5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} sixteenth–ranked Fresno State Bulldogs, led by ninth–year head coach Pat Hill and quarterback Paul Pinegar. The Bulldogs took an early lead on a Pinegar {{touchdown}} pass that was answered by LenDale White's rushing touchdown for the Trojans {{to leave the}} game tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. After a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, the Trojans could <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> with a Mario Danelo field goal. A second passing touchdown by Pinegar and another Danelo field goal closed out the half with the Bulldogs leading 21–13. The Trojans seemed to take control of the game in the third quarter with a Leinart touchdown run, a Reggie Bush touchdown run, and a Leinart touchdown pass that gave the Trojans a 13-point lead. Pinegar answered for the Bulldogs with his third touchdown pass of the game, but a 50-yard touchdown rush by Bush allowed the Trojans to keep the same lead, Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Pinegar's fourth touchdown pass and a second rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, gave them a 1-point lead with nineminutes left in the game. After a 65-yard run by Bush, White scored for the Trojans, who missed on a two–point conversion attempt. A Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 50–42 lead, and the Trojans won after intercepting Pinegar with a minute left in the game. Bush set a Pac-10 record with 513total yards in the game, including almost 300yards rushing, and the Trojans increased their winning streak to 33games.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E

25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E
25|$|The NH {{had been}} making up any {{shortfall}} {{in the ability of}} the NYW to meet its debt obligations. Thus, when the NH entered bankruptcy in 1935, the NYW did as well. Former New Haven General Manager Clinton L. Bardo was appointed as Trustee to try to turn around the fortunes of the ailing Westchester. But the trustees of the NH bankruptcy and the trustees of the NYW bankruptcy were responsible to different groups of creditors. The liquidation brought them into conflict. The NYW was forced to cease operating on the Port Chester line to enhance the revenues of the NH from its parallel service. The loss of revenue could not be offset by lower costs. If the NYW had been left intact, it would have required the New Haven to pay off a bond issue that was due in 1946. Total liquidation was the <b>only</b> <b>answer.</b> Bardo {{died of a heart attack}} in August 1937, before the full effect of his policies could be realized. The NYW ceased operations on December 31, 1937.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to get a}} 2nd {{straight}} win {{and stay}} alive for the playoffs, the Chargers went to Kansas City for a divisional road game vs. the Chiefs. The 'Bolts trailed early as RB Larry Johnson threw a 4-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez. The Chiefs extended the lead to 14–0 when QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 1-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe. The 'Bolts closed out the half with Nate Kaeding getting a 32-yard field goal. The Chiefs started the 2nd half by Thigpen scrambling for a 3-yard TD.

500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|Zoe Detsi-Diamanti, in {{her book}} The Flesh Made Text Made Flesh, commented on the episode's {{depiction}} of race. She argues that the episode {{makes the point that}} a [...] "perfectly normal" [...] black man looks a certain way, pointing out that the episode states that a black man is defined by a [...] "certain skin pigment". Any exception to this norm is depicted in a negative manner, with science being the <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> to unnatural phenomena. Dean Kowalski agreed with the analysis in The Philosophy of The X-Files, commenting that one of the main themes of the episodes revolved around science's attempt to explain folk theories and paranormal phenomena. The episode's antagonist Aboah, escapes the FBI by fitting into a dinner cart, a feat that was compared to slaves escaping in unconformable slave ships.|$|E
500|$|In {{the region}} of Dragačevo, western Serbia, people told of the vilovit men, who would {{disappear}} {{at the sight of}} hail clouds, reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after the storm was over. Asked where they had been to, they would <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> that they had gone to fight against those who led the hail clouds toward their village. The adjective vilovit means [...] "having a vilas properties" [...] or [...] "vila-like". The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies, female anthropomorphic spirits of woods, mountains, clouds, and waters, who had magical powers. In {{the region of}} Tamnava, north-western Central Serbia, the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks. An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić, published in 1875. In the story, men from Krnić and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a hail storm brought by alien vetrenjaks. They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them, their bodies turning black and blue from the blows. The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain, away from their fields.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{have stated}} that Man of Steel is a {{religious}} allegory, especially since Warner Bros. set up a website www.manofsteelresources.com that contains [...] "a nine-page pamphlet entitled Jesus – The Original Superhero". Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the passion of Christ, stating that [...] "Kal-El is {{more than willing to}} sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth. Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Supes decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation." [...] Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within Man of Steel: [...] "Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation. Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, like Jesus, 'He’ll be a god to them.'" [...] Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that [...] "Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross," [...] a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film. The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks [...] "counsel at a church." [...] Writing for The Huffington Post, Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler, citing, [...] "He feels his vision for a pure Krypton (i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program) is the <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> for survival." ...|$|E
