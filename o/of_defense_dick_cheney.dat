5|$|In 1991, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney,</b> {{upon the}} {{recommendation}} of Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice, identified Loring and five other SAC bases for closure through the BRAC Commission. The commission recommended that the 42d Bomb Wing be disestablished, and the B-52Gs transferred to the 410th Bomb Wing at K.I. Sawyer AFB near Marquette, Michigan. The KC-135 aircraft were realigned to USAF Reserve and other active units.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented {{serious problems with}} the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{originally}} envisioned ordering 750 ATFs {{at a cost}} of $26.2billion, {{with production}} beginning in 1994. The 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996. By 1997, funding instability had further cut the total to 339, which was again reduced to 277 F-22s by 2003. In 2004, the Department of Defense (DoD) further reduced this to 183 operational aircraft, despite the USAF's preference for 381. In 2006, a multi-year procurement plan was implemented to save $15billion but raise each aircraft's cost. That year the program's total cost was projected to be $62billion for 183 F-22s distributed to seven combat squadrons. In 2007, Lockheed Martin received a $7.3billion contract to increase the order to 183 production F-22s and extend manufacturing through 2011.|$|E
50|$|Between 1989-1991, Rowen {{served as}} Assistant Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> under <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney.</b>|$|R
25|$|During the {{administration}} of George H. W. Bush, Hadley was a Pentagon aide to Paul Wolfowitz, serving as the Assistant Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for International Security Policy from 1989 to 1993. In that position, he had responsibility for defense policy toward NATO and Western Europe, on nuclear weapons and ballistic missile defense, and arms control. He also participated in policy issues involving export control {{and the use of}} space. Hadley served as Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney's</b> representative in talks led by Secretary of State James Baker that resulted in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties, START I and START II.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Barlow {{transferred}} {{to the office of}} the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> where he initiated an in-house intelligence analysis program. He was in a chain of command below Stephen J. Hadley, then Assistant Secretary of Defense; the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> was <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney.</b> His early work included an effort to sound the alarm about the now-discredited Pakistani nuclear scientist and proliferator, Abdul Qadeer Khan. In particular, he discovered that Pakistan's nuclear program depended upon clandestine and illegal procurement activity within the United States. The US administration, however, knew that this was the case; indeed, his report detailed occasions when the State Department under Ronald Reagan had actually helped it happen, warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and approving export licenses for restricted goods.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
25|$|Former Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> signed DOD Directive 5200.34 in November 1992, {{establishing}} the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies {{as an element}} of EUCOM under the authority, direction {{and control of the}} EUCOM commander. The Marshall Center became a German-American partnership when a memorandum of agreement was signed on December 2, 1994, between headquarters EUCOM and the German Ministry of Defense.|$|E

25|$|In July 2000, {{shortly before}} the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush {{campaign}} sources said Elizabeth Dole was {{on the short list}} to be named the vice-presidential nominee, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former Missouri Senator John Danforth. Many pundits believed that Dole was the frontrunner for the vice presidential nomination. Bush then surprised most pundits by selecting former U.S. Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney,</b> who was actually in charge of leading Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000, Pataki's name {{surfaced}} on {{the short}} list to be the running mate for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, along with the names of Governor John Engler of Michigan, Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, former Senator John Danforth of Missouri, and former U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina. Bush eventually selected the man {{who was in charge of}} scouting vice presidential candidates, former Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney.</b> Pataki had strongly campaigned for Bush including an unsuccessful effort to keep John McCain off the New York primary ballot (which Bush ultimately won).|$|E
25|$|Bush asked former Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> {{to head up}} a team to help {{select a}} running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney himself should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not {{specifically}} disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both {{of his or her}} votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of Texas for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.|$|E

2500|$|The General's War won {{high praise}} from several critics and decisionmakers, with then <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> {{describing}} it as [...] "a fascinating {{account of the}} war" [...] that he would [...] "recommend" [...] "as something that gives them a different element {{of some of the}} key decisions that were made." [...] Jim Lehrer described it as [...] "A superb account and analysis of what went right and what went wrong in the Gulf War"; and Eliot Cohen, writing in Foreign Affairs, called it [...] "the best single volume on the Gulf War." ...|$|R
50|$|In June 1990, <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> {{ordered the}} {{missiles}} removed from bombers on alert pending a safety inquiry. A decade earlier in September 1980, A B-52H on alert status at Grand Forks AFB in northeastern North Dakota experienced a wing fire that burned for three hours, fanned by evening winds of 26 mph. Fortunately, the wind direction was {{parallel to the}} fuselage, which likely had SRAMs in the main bay. Eight years later, weapons expert Roger Batzel testified to a closed U.S. Senate hearing that a change of wind direction could {{have led to a}} conventional explosion and a widespread scattering of radioactive plutonium.|$|R
25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease. Bush {{was seen as the}} early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E
25|$|After {{wrapping}} up the 1988 Republican nomination, Bush selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana {{as his running}} mate, surprising many who expected Bush to select a more experienced running mate. Quayle was often mocked for his verbal gaffes, and many Republicans urged Bush to dump Quayle from the ticket. Bush selected a mostly new Cabinet, but kept around many former Reagan officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Bush's long-time friend James Baker, who had served as Reagan's Chief of Staff, became Secretary of State. Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> had previously served as Gerald Ford's Chief of Staff and would later serve as vice president under George W. Bush. Bush's first pick for Defense Secretary, John Tower, {{was rejected by the}} Senate, becoming the first cabinet nominee of an incoming president to be rejected. Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.|$|E
500|$|On the one hand, {{the relief}} of MacArthur {{established}} a precedent that generals and admirals could be fired for any public or private disagreement with government policy. In 1977, Major General John K. Singlaub publicly criticized proposed cuts {{in the size of}} American forces in South Korea, and was summarily relieved by President Jimmy Carter for making statements [...] "inconsistent with announced national security policy." [...] During the Gulf War in 1990, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> relieved the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Michael Dugan, for showing [...] "poor judgment at a very sensitive time" [...] in making a series of statements to the media during a visit to Saudi Arabia. [...] General Stanley A. McChrystal was sacked by President Barack Obama in 2009 after McChrystal and his staff made disparaging remarks about senior civilian government officials in an article published in Rolling Stone magazine. This elicited comparisons with MacArthur, as the war in Afghanistan was not going well. On the other hand, Major General James N. Post III was relieved and issued a letter of reprimand in 2015 for discouraging personnel under his command from communicating with the Congress, which he described as [...] "treason".|$|E
5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|R
50|$|As the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew {{increasingly}} impatient, and considered taking unilateral {{military action against}} Iraq. On 22 January 1991, a Scud missile hit the Israeli city of Ramat Gan, after two coalition Patriots failed to intercept it. Three elderly people suffered fatal heart attacks, another 96 people were injured, and 20 apartment buildings were damaged. After this attack, the Israelis warned that if the US failed to stop the attacks, they would. At one point, Israeli commandos boarded helicopters prepared to fly into Iraq, but the mission was called off after {{a phone call from}} US <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney,</b> reporting on the extent of coalition efforts to destroy Scuds and emphasizing that Israeli intervention could endanger US forces.|$|R
50|$|Two {{days before}} the coup, Giroldi's wife, Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, {{informed}} United States Southern Command that a coup was imminent. This resulted in a meeting between Moisés Giroldi and two CIA agents. U.S. officials claimed that Goroldi only asked for minimal help: protection for his family and roadblocks by U.S. troops in the Panama Canal Zone at two strategic locations {{in order to prevent}} troops coming to Noriega's rescue. U.S. <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> subsequently stated that the Bush administration distrusted Giroldi, fearing they were being led into a trap designed to embarrass the U.S. and also doubted Giroldi's ability to succeed and to deliver Noriega into U.S. hands to stand trial. As a result, the U.S. declined to give specific commitments on supporting the coup.|$|R
2500|$|Development {{problems}} and limited funding caused {{delays in the}} late 1980s. [...] Criticisms were made of the developing aircraft and questions were raised about more cost-effective alternatives during this time. [...] In April 1990, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> reduced the order from 210 to 120 aircraft. [...] The maiden flight of the C-17 took place on 15 September 1991 from the McDonnell Douglas's plant in Long Beach, California, about a year behind schedule. The first aircraft (T-1) and five more production models (P1-P5) participated in extensive flight testing and evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base. [...] Two complete airframes were built for static and repeated load testing.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat was the Navy's {{primary air}} superiority fighter and fleet defense interceptor. [...] Then-Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> {{described}} the F-14 as 1960s technology, and drastically cut back F-14D procurement in 1989 before cancelling production altogether in 1991, {{in favor of}} the updated F/A-18E/F. [...] The decision to replace the Tomcat with an all-Hornet Carrier Air Wing was controversial; Vietnam War ace and Congressman Duke Cunningham criticized the Super Hornet as an unproven design that compromised air superiority. In 1992, the Navy canceled the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), which would have been a navalized variant of the Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. As a cheaper alternative to NATF, Grumman proposed substantial improvements to the F-14 beyond Quick Strike, but Congress rejected them as too costly and reaffirmed its commitment to the less expensive F/A-18E/F.|$|E
2500|$|On June 28, 1991, Petrelis held a {{press conference}} {{attended}} by the Associated Press, Tribune Broadcasting, The Washington Post, and a local NBC affiliate to out Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. Williams had risen to prominence during the Gulf War, acting as a Pentagon spokesperson. His homosexuality was considered an open secret in some Washington circles. Petrelis' press release stated, [...] "Pete Williams, an openly closeted gay man, hypocritically remains silent in his job as Pentagon spokesman, while the Department of Defense continues its irrational policy of ejecting thousands of gays and lesbians from the armed services." [...] At the press conference, Petrelis unfurled a poster bearing an image of Williams that read: PETE WILLIAMS ABSOLUTELY QUEER: PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON, TAP DANCER, CONSUMMATE QUEER. No one reported the story, but Petrelis returned to the Pentagon on August 6, 1991, to intercept reporters as they entered the building for a regularly scheduled Tuesday morning briefing. Petrelis held an impromptu press conference. He carried with him a box of copies of an article by Michelangelo Signorile from the most recent issue of the Advocate, outing Williams. Petrelis scolded the reporters for ignoring the story and urged them to ask Williams directly about his homosexuality. A half hour into Williams' briefing that day, Rolf Paasch, a foreign correspondent with Berlin's Die Tageszeitung, asked Williams if he could confirm or deny the claims that he was gay, and whether or not he had discussed possible resignation with Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney.</b> Williams responded by saying he was not paid to discuss his personal life and that [...] "government people don't discuss in public whatever they may say to their bosses." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although a short war, {{communication}} {{from the administration}} during the Gulf War was significant. Learning lessons from the television coverage of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon strategically communicated the Gulf War to the American public by placing certain restrictions on press coverage. Select journalists were allowed to visit the front lines in [...] "press pools." [...] These reporters had {{to be accompanied by}} U.S. military. [...] The military's communication policy regarding Operation Desert Storm were disclosed in a 10-page document entitled the Annex Foxtrot, drafted by Captain Ron Wildermuth, the chief aide for public affairs. This was the first conflict in which reporters had to be escorted by military officials called the Department <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> National Media Pool. Officials claimed national security and classifying information from the enemy as reason for these new policies. <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> was primarily responsible for the oversight of these press restrictions, and modeled the restrictions after the press blackout during the invasion of Panama in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Kasich was {{a member}} of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years. He {{developed}} a [...] "fairly hawkish" [...] reputation on that committee, although he [...] "also zealously challenged" [...] defense spending he considered wasteful. Among the Pentagon projects that he targeted were the B-2 bomber program (teaming up with Democratic representative Ron Dellums to cut the program, their efforts were partly successful) and the A-12 bomber program (ultimately canceled by <b>defense</b> secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney</b> in 1991). He participated extensively in the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which reorganized the U.S. Department <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> He also pushed through the bill creating the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which closed obsolete U.S. military bases, and successfully opposed a proposed $110 million expansion of the Pentagon building after the end of the Cold War. He also [...] "proposed a national commission on arms control" [...] and [...] "urged tighter controls over substances that could be used for biological warfare." ...|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 1991, Bush {{arrived in}} Moscow for a summit with Mikhail Gorbachev. He and Barbara Bush stayed with Gorbachev {{and his wife}} Raisa in a dacha outside Moscow, where the two leaders held {{informal}} discussions. Bush told Gorbachev {{that it would not}} be in America's interest for the Soviet Union to collapse, though hardline members of Bush's Republican Party—most notably Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> Cheney—embraced this outcome. He assured Gorbachev that he would counsel against independence when he travelled on to Ukraine on August 1, on the next leg of his visit.|$|R
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney,</b> in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E

2500|$|Technical issues, {{development}} cost overruns, growing unit costs, and delays {{led to the}} termination of the A-12 Avenger II program on January 13, 1991 by <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Dick</b> <b>Cheney.</b> [...] Years of litigation would proceed over the contract's termination: the government claimed that the contractors had defaulted on the contract and were not entitled to the final progress payments, while McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics believed that the contract was terminated out of convenience and thus the money was owed. [...] The case was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014. [...] The chaos and financial stress created {{by the collapse of}} the A-12 program led to the layoff of 5,600 employees.

5000|$|The US and the UN gave several public {{justifications}} for {{involvement in the}} conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity.
