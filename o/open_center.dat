5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an <b>open</b> <b>center</b> of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E

500|$|... "Amazing Grace" [...] {{came to be}} {{an emblem}} of a Christian {{movement}} and {{a symbol of the}} U.S. itself as the country was involved in a great political experiment, attempting to employ democracy as a means of government. Shape note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an <b>open</b> <b>center,</b> each song employing a different director, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans. This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] set to [...] "New Britain" [...] was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace. The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the Trail of Tears, the Cherokee sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by Samuel Worcester that had been translated into the Cherokee language became very popular.|$|E

2500|$|In the late-1940s the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad {{was seeking}} {{a way to}} {{increase}} capacity on commuter trains serving Chicago, Illinois, without having to add more cars to handle {{the increasing number of}} commuters. The problem faced by the Burlington Route was that its main terminal in Chicago, Chicago Union Station, charged the railroads serving it by the length a given train, and the Burlington wanted to avoid such charges. Because of the line's satisfaction with Budd's products they approached Budd seeking to find a solution. Budd proposed to build coaches that were taller than the typical lightweight passenger car while keeping the streamline car's length of 85 feet, with the cars having a capacity 50% more than previous commuter cars. To address the issue of the conductor collecting tickets without having to climb a set of stairs, the upper level was designed {{in such a way that}} its center portion was open so that the conductor could reach the tickets from upper-level passengers. Two rows of individual seats, one on each side of the car, provided for the increase in seating capacity. The unique design of the upper level's <b>open</b> <b>center</b> section led to the cars being called [...] "Gallery" [...] cars. With the design approved by the Burlington an order was submitted for 30 cars. These cars, built as Budd lot 9679-041, were delivered to the line between August 1950 and January 1951 and not only marked a change in how the commuters were handled but also were the first cars in commuter service to have air conditioning. The Burlington equipped its earlier cars with air conditioning as well, once the new cars had entered service.|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: <b>Open</b> multidisciplinary <b>centers</b> were operated in the mid 1990 s for victims of sexual assaults in Oslo and Reykjavik. However, in Copenhagen and Helsinki forensic medical examination was only available to victims who reported directly to the police. One of the main aims {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of these different service facilities in four Nordic capitals on the victims' frequency to seek help and report sexual assaults to the police. METHODS: The age and attendance profile of 380 individuals, seeking support after sexual assault, was compared for the four capitals over a period of 1 year. The circumstances and consequences of assault, frequency and time lag of reporting were also compared. RESULTS: <b>Open</b> <b>centers</b> received several times more victims, especially in younger age groups, including more reported cases, when compared with the population at risk than forensic institutes. Victims were seen earlier for examination at forensic institutes that dealt with a more limited spectrum of sexual assaults than the <b>open</b> <b>centers.</b> The proportion of rape was higher amongst victims brought to forensic institutes whereas a higher proportion of victims received at <b>open</b> <b>centers</b> had been exposed to less violent assaults. The frequency of visits was higher at weekends, between 50 % and 70 % of victims reported consumption of alcohol, and one-third were attacked while sleeping. In the majority of cases only one perpetrator was involved, most often unknown or peripherally known to the victim. CONCLUSION: <b>Open</b> multidisciplinary <b>centers</b> receive and assist considerably more victims, reporting and not reporting sexual assaults than forensic institutes...|$|R
