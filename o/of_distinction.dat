40|$|ABSTRACT. Emergence {{is defined}} as a process which cannot be {{described}} by a fixed model, consisting <b>of</b> invariant <b>distinctions.</b> Hence emergence must be described by a metamodel, representing the transition of one model to another one by means <b>of</b> a <b>distinction</b> dynamics. The dynamics <b>of</b> <b>distinctions</b> is based on the processes of variation and selection, resulting in an invariant distinction, which constrains the variety of and thus defines a new system. A classification of emergence processes is proposed, based on the following criteria: amount of variety, internality / externality of variation and selection, number of levels, and contingency of constraint. It is argued that traditional formal and computational models are incapable of representing the more general types of emergence, but {{that it is possible to}} generalize them on the basis of the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>distinctions...</b>|$|R
