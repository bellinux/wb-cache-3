5|$|As {{the player}} wakes up each morning during the Adventure mode, Maxwell appears <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> comments. At first he seems {{impressed}} at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce but then becomes completely enraged.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too much from the cult of Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Main and Preece Stands are 25 {{executive}} boxes, {{which have}} an attached net to catch balls directed <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> a total capacity of 209. The Bobbers Stand stood here until 1986, when the seats {{were removed from}} the stand and replaced with the boxes.|$|E

60|$|They {{had come}} to the stables. Three of the horses were there, {{including}} the thoroughbred Ciccio was going to ride. He stood and examined the beasts critically. Then he spoke to them with strange sounds, patted them, stroked them down, felt them, slid his hand down <b>them,</b> <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> under <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> felt their legs.|$|R
5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs {{in order to avoid}} them being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> then burn them alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E
5|$|Outside of combat, Scarygirl navigates {{the game}} world by running, jumping, gliding, and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects. Scarygirl {{eventually}} gains {{access to a}} feather attachment that can replace the hook on her tentacle arm, allowing Scarygirl to hover and reach otherwise inaccessible locations. Stages contain deadly traps {{that have to be}} avoided, often by grappling <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> most stages contain at least two paths through the stage, although after choosing one the option to backtrack and take the other route exists. Crystals, which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration, and heart fragments, which increase Scarygirl's maximum health, are scattered throughout stages. In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments, players will have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} large gates {{used as an}} {{entrance}} to the palace some which bear names like the Imambara, Chawk and Dakshin Darwaza (south gate).

25|$|By {{means of}} {{majority}} votes of all deputies, the National Assembly elects the President of the Assembly (speaker) {{and one or}} more Vice-Presidents (deputy speakers), usually one vice-president from each parliamentary group. The President of the National Assembly represents the National Assembly, convokes its sessions, presides <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> performs other official activities. The vice-presidents assist the President in performing the duties within his/her purview.|$|E
25|$|After the Enlightenment, {{most of the}} expeditions {{that went}} to East Africa and the Pacific had Teide {{as one of the}} most {{rewarding}} targets. The expedition of Lord George Macartney, George Staunton and John Barrow in 1792 almost ended in tragedy, as a major snowstorm and rain swept <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they failed to reach the peak of Teide, just barely getting past Montaña Blanca.|$|E
60|$|And {{to those}} faces gazing up, George's lips were grim, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>them</b> came <b>and</b> {{went a little}} bitter smile; but on his {{forehead}} he felt still the touch of his horse's muzzle, and his eyes, which none could see, were dark with pain.|$|R

25|$|A blind Oedipus now {{exits the}} palace and begs to be exiled {{as soon as}} possible. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be {{consulted}} regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus's two daughters (and half-sisters), Antigone and Ismene, are sent out, and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He asks Creon to watch <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.|$|E
25|$|Elegant Action Figures: quite {{different}} from the Tassel and Sash figures, these figures are almost always shown running, kneeling or hunting with multi-barbed spears and boomerangs. These are difficult to place in the style sequence as they are the only figures that are not superimposed over a painting from another period. Also, no other style is superimposed <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they are the only style that has not been defaced. Stylistically, they are believed to fall between the sash and Clothes Peg Figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known kingdoms {{to emerge}} in modern Ghana were the Mole-Dagbani states. The Mole-Dagombas came on horseback from present-day Burkina Faso under a single leader, Naa Gbewaa. With their advanced weapons {{and the presence of}} a central authority they easily invaded and occupied the lands of the local people ruled by the Tendamba (land god priests), established themselves as rulers <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> made Gambaga their capital. The death of Naa Gbewaa caused civil war among his children, some of whom broke off and founded separate states including Dagbon, Mamprugu, Mossi, Nanumba and Wala.|$|E

People read his books <b>and</b> quarrel <b>over</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> the critics are all against him, and a regular flaying, with salt and vinegar rubbed in afterward, will tell more with people who like good old-fashioned fiction than anything else.

25|$|The {{war ended}} in a ceasefire, with neither side {{explicitly}} accepting the peace terms of the other. Although there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views {{at the time they}} had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result. Historian James Belich has claimed that the Māori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> had therefore been victorious. But he said the Māori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the Waikato.|$|E
25|$|This spider {{builds a}} funnel-shaped web to catch its prey. It usually {{consists}} of a multitude of stressed silk threads spun over a flat surface (such as a window sill) near any corner, with a funnel-like structure reaching for the corner, in which the spider would typically reside (hence the name). These webs can become quite large if undisturbed. They act like cord strings, helping the spider glide <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> once a prey stumbles into the web, it will quickly get attacked, then dragged inside the funnel part and eaten, but very rarely stored underneath the structure.|$|E
25|$|Lehi prisoners {{captured}} by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> therefore was illegal. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, {{even when it was}} clear that this would have spared them the death penalty. In one case Moshe Barazani, a Lehi member, and Meir Feinstein, an Irgun member, committed suicide in prison with a grenade smuggled inside an orange so the British could not hang them.|$|E
