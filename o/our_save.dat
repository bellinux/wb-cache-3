40|$|We present Save ‘Em, an {{augmented}} reality-based {{computer game}} designed {{to explore the}} challenge of making computer games more immersive and engaging by moving gameplay to the physical environment. As in the classic computer game, Lemmings, Save ‘Em is based on maneuvering a group of slow-witted characters called Dudes through a treacherous maze. Using augmented reality techniques, Save ‘Em places virtual game entities directly within the player’s physical environment; gameplay takes place on a real game board rather than on a computer screen, and the Dudes ’ fate is tied directly to the player’s physical actions. In this paper we discuss <b>our</b> <b>Save</b> ‘Em game implementation and use our current findings to explain how moving game interaction from the virtual domain into the physical world using augmented reality can affect both gameplay and the players ’ overall experience...|$|E

50|$|<b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Shores {{has been}} {{conducting}} beach, river, and inland cleanups since 1978. The nonprofit primarily hosts its public, private, and school cleanups throughout San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Monterey counties. In 2014, <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Shores led a total of 348 cleanups. During these cleanups, <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Shores and community volunteers removed a total of 49,469 pounds of waste. Data is collected from each cleanup to identify pollution and marine debris issues impacting the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the Pacific ocean at large. For example, in 2014, the top three items collected were cigarette butts (109,844), small plastic pieces (46,978) like microplastics, and plastic food wrappers (27,317). Many of <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Shores’ advocacy efforts, including local bans on single-use plastics and polystyrene containers, are driven by cleanup data analysis.|$|R

40|$|We {{proposed}} a two-round protocol for solving the Millionaires' Problem {{in the setting}} of semi-honest parties. Our protocol uses either multiplicative or additive homomorphic encryptions. Previously proposed protocols used additive or XOR homomorphic encryption schemes only. The computation and communication costs of our protocol are in the same asymptotic order as those of the other efficient protocols. Nevertheless, since multiplicative homomorphic encryption scheme is more efficient than an additive one practically, <b>our</b> construction <b>saves</b> computation time and communication bandwidth in practicality. In comparison with the most efficient previous solution, <b>our</b> protocol <b>saves</b> 89 % computation time and 25 % communication bits...|$|R
