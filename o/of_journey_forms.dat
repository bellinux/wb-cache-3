50|$|Ra—variously conflated {{with other}} solar gods such as Amon and Hathor—was said to {{travel through the}} sky on the barge, {{providing}} light to the world. Each twelfth <b>of</b> his <b>journey</b> <b>formed</b> one <b>of</b> the twelve Egyptian hours of the day, each overseen by a protective deity. Ra then rode the Atet through the underworld, with each hour of the night considered a gate overseen by twelve more protective deities.

40|$|Objective: The {{application}} of geographic information systems (GIS) to describe commute route elements is commonplace, yet {{the accuracy of}} GIS-estimated commute routes is not clear. This study compared GIS-estimated commute routes against actual routes traveled as measured using global positioning systems (GPS) to examine differences in urban form surrounding travel routes across different buffer sizes and travel modes. Methods: Thirty-seven adults from Auckland, New Zealand {{participated in the study}} between January and March 2008. Participants wore GPS units and completed a travel log for 7 days. GPS data were integrated into a GIS database to ascertain commute routes. Results: Overall, 29 commute journeys were appropriately captured by GPS. Levels of agreement between actual and shortest commute routes were dependent on the buffer size selected, built environment variable examined, and travel mode. Conclusions: Despite technical difficulties, GPS assessment of routes traveled is recommended to provide an accurate assessment <b>of</b> commute <b>journey</b> urban <b>form</b> elements...|$|R
50|$|In 1982 Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton {{became the}} first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They {{departed}} from Cape Crozier, Ellesmere Island, on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship MV Benjamin Bowring and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result <b>of</b> this <b>journey,</b> which <b>formed</b> a section of the three-year Transglobe Expedition 1979-1982, Fiennes and Burton {{became the first}} people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone.

40|$|Project (M. A., Liberal Arts) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. ???Sowing Seeds of the Pomegranate: A Garden of Memoir??? {{is a work}} of {{creative}} nonfiction. The inspiration for this project goes back more than thirty years to the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, a time when the author lived in the backwoods hills of Middle Tennessee. This work is composed in three aspects. First is the story itself. Second are snippets of myth, folklore, and sacred literature woven throughout the story. Third is the <b>journey</b> <b>of</b> the woman telling the tale as she moves from youthful womanhood to become a mother. 	The story begins with a group of people who, in the mid- 1970 s, decide to join the growing ???back-to-the-earth??? movement. For them, this means leaving the northern city life they???ve always known to become part of a community of people following a different way of life in the southern hills <b>of</b> Tennessee. Their <b>journey</b> <b>forms</b> the core <b>of</b> this story, and the author???s involvement the lens through which we glimpse them. The idea to incorporate myth, folklore, and sacred literature into the story came about through the author???s studies at Sacramento State University, and from her firm personal conviction that the peoples who told these stories are not so different from ourselves. Their stories are relevant still, if only we take the time look for the connections to our own lives. These threads of story are woven throughout human history. The final piece to tie these threads together is the story of Persephone and Demeter. This myth is used to illustrate the author???s personal journey from the young woman to the mother: she embodies Persephone at the start, and becomes Demeter by the end. Liberal Art...|$|R

50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Ratnam, his wife Malar {{and his three}} children, Haresh, Hashwini and Akshara, each having their own struggles in their life journey. Problems arise when Malar disapproves of Hashwini's boyfriend, Brandon due to his race. Knowing that the tension will soon potentially divide the family, Haresh agrees to marrying Kamini, his cousin. Meanwhile, Hashwini gets married without her mother's presence. Then, Ratnam meets his ex-girlfriend whom his father had rejected when he was younger. He finds out that she's working as a counselor in Askhara's university, and starts talking to her. Akshara too faces problems in university with her friends Prem, Kavin and Shwetha. She also finds out she has had brain tumor for some time already. Furthermore, Haresh {{falls in love with}} another girl, Shalini, and is stuck between Kamini and her. How all the characters deal with their own problems as a family, fight for their loves and learn lessons in the <b>journey</b> <b>of</b> life <b>forms</b> the rest of the plot for the story.|$|R

5|$|On 1 September {{the train}} {{departed}} Prague Main railway station. On this first day it travelled to the German city of Nuremberg, crossing the Czech - German border at Furth im Wald in the Bavarian Forest. The following day, {{the train was}} to travel across Germany to Cologne, via Frankfurt am Main. Instead of Frankfurt however, it travelled via Wiesbaden and the right bank of the River Rhine. On the third day, the train arrived on the North Sea coast at the Dutch ferry port, Hook of Holland, crossing the Dutch - German border at Emmerich am Rhein and passing through the Netherlands via Rotterdam. The passengers disembarked the train to cross the North Sea to Great Britain overnight on the Stena Line ferry Stena Britannica to Harwich, a port in the East of England on the country boundary between Essex and Suffolk.
