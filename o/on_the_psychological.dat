40|$|Rationale In {{the current}} {{literature}} there lies {{a shortage of}} qualitative experiential data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transpersonal <b>psychological</b> and parapsychological aspects of the ayahuasca experience. Data on ayahuasca users from Western civilisation is limited. There is an understudy of transformation and ayahuasca drug usage. Aim This study aims to collect qualitative data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transpersonal <b>psychological</b> and parapsychological aspects of the ayahuasca experience from Western users...|$|R

25|$|A great {{portion of}} Blue Mars is {{concerned}} with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists, most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated longevity treatments. In particular, Robinson speculates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> effects of ultra-longevity including memory loss, personality change, mental instability, and existential boredom.|$|E
25|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} directly influenced some painters, who incorporated {{aspects of}} Flemish Primitive painting into their work. Flemish expressionist Gustave Van de Woestijne changed {{his approach to}} portraiture, focusing more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> aspects, while his colleague Valerius de Saedeleer {{was influenced by the}} landscapes he saw at the exhibition.|$|E
25|$|Theravadins {{also held}} {{a theory of}} momentariness (Khāṇavāda), but it was less ontological than Sarvāstivāda and more focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> aspects of time. The Theravada divided every dhamma into three {{different}} instants of origination (uppādakkhaṇa), endurance (ṭhitikkhaṇa) and cessation (bhaṅgakkhaṇa). They also held that only mental events were momentary, material events could endure for longer.|$|E

30|$|Burnout {{dimensions}} and sleep difficulties {{were related to}} a decrease of psychological well-being and physical health among preclinical medical students. In the physical health domain, the students scored worse when emotional exhaustion and sleep difficulties increased. In <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> domain, <b>the</b> score decrease {{was associated with the}} score increase in the cynicism and sleep difficulties. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being, physical health, and the social relationships were better when the sense of academic efficacy increased.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} few studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> aspects of BDSM using modern {{scientific}} standards.

25|$|Hackworth {{returned}} to the U.S. in the mid-1980s and began working as a contributing editor on defense issues for Newsweek. He also made regular television appearances to discuss various military-related topics, and the shortcomings of the military. His commentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, based on his own experiences in overcoming it, resonated with disabled veterans.|$|E
25|$|Organizationally, it {{is divided}} into 52 epistles.

25|$|External impact. The report {{does not}} {{consider}} {{the effects of the}} abuse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> welfare of the parents of children who were in the control of the system.

25|$|During the {{classical}} period of economics, microeconomics was {{closely linked to}} psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and justice, and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> underpinnings of utility. However, during the development of neo-classical economics economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science, deducing economic behavior from assumptions {{about the nature of}} economic agents. They developed the concept of homo economicus, whose psychology was fundamentally rational.|$|E

25|$|Language is {{a central}} {{question}} in post-colonial studies. Many post-colonial scholars and writers detail the colonial practice of imposing the colonizer's own native languages onto the peoples they colonized, even forbidding {{the use of the}} colonized people's native tongue. They examine this practice as part of the systematic oppression of imperialism in neocolonial societies, and they investigate its ramifications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological,</b> physical, and cultural well-being of colonized peoples. Within the context of post-colonial studies, language is a weapon and a site of intense neocolonial conflict.|$|E
25|$|Echoing many of Ashby’s assertions in her 2007 paper {{entitled}} “Can Scottish {{public library}} services claim they are socially inclusive of all minority groups when lesbian fiction {{is still so}} inaccessible?”, Jaqueline Goldthorp outlines some of the challenges that lesbians face when trying to find lesbian fiction in Scottish libraries. She ties her study of lesbian literature {{to the importance of}} reading fiction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being of women, arguing that women often turn to fiction reading for self-affirmation and identity building. In addition, lesbian fiction titles can be priced up to 30% higher than non-lesbian titles, meaning that, for many low-income or working class lesbians, libraries are the only means of access for these titles Goldthorp surveyed 26 Scottish libraries and found that, in 2007, the majority had less than ten books labelled at “lesbian fiction,” and almost no recent award-winning titles. She suggests diversity training and education about methods and resources for providing service to lesbians for library staff as a way of promoting greater inclusion.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is another}} environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within {{the real estate}} industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination {{have been shown to}} have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{integration}} {{of research on}} motor mimicry and automatic imitation could reveal plausible indications that these phenomena depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>psychological</b> and neural processes.

25|$|Falkinburg, {{determined}} to continue improving his character, sought {{the help of}} Jake Roberts who advised him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> aspects of the business. After his injury had healed, Falkinburg returned to WCW television in 1994, with his wife Kimberly as the Diamond Doll, and an on-screen bodyguard, Max Muscle. He held open arm wrestling challenges to win Kimberly, but Max always helped him win or arm wrestled for him. He was also involved in an angle where he {{was said to have}} supposedly amassed the sum of 13 million dollars through victories in arm wrestling competitions, a fortune that he would later lose. He also had a long feud with Dave Sullivan because Sullivan gave Kimberly gifts (and largely because Falkinburg was defeated by Sullivan in one of the arm wrestling contests, which earned him a date with Kimberly). At Fall Brawl, Falkinburg won his first championship when he defeated Renegade for the WCW World Television Championship. In the build-up to his first title defense at Halloween Havoc, there was growing dissension between Falkinburg and Kimberly. Johnny B. Badd defeated Falkinburg for the TV title and again at World War 3 on November 26, winning Kimberly's freedom from DDP. At Uncensored on March 24, 1996 The Booty Man with Kimberly as The Booty Babe defeated Diamond Dallas Falkinburg in a Loser Leaves Town match.|$|E
500|$|Mostly {{written from}} late 1915 to early 1916, {{with a few}} stories {{completed}} closer to publication, they were [...] "...conceived as complementary parts of a whole, centered {{in the background of}} a single community." [...] The book consists of twenty-two stories, with the first story, [...] "The Book of the Grotesque", serving as an introduction. Each of the stories shares a specific character's past and present struggle to overcome the loneliness and isolation that seems to permeate the town. Stylistically, because of its emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> insights of characters over plot, and plain-spoken prose, Winesburg, Ohio is {{known as one of the}} earliest works of Modernist literature.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{positive}} reviews, Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said The Strangers is [...] "suspenseful," [...] "highly effective," [...] and [...] "smartly maintain {{its commitment to}} tingling creepiness over bludgeoning horror." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a [...] "creepily atmospheric psychological thriller with a death grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> aspect." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that, [...] "This {{is one of those}} rare horror movies that concentrates on suspense and terror rather than on gore and a high body count." [...] Scott Tobias of The Onions A.V. Club said that [...] "as an exercise in controlled mayhem, horror movies don't get much scarier." ...|$|E

The most notable component of this {{theory is that}} it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated.|$|R
