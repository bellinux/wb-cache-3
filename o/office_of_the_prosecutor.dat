2500|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia was {{established}} in 1993 by the United Nations Security Council to conduct the trials of crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. Feminist activists {{played a part in}} creating the structure of the ICTY over the gender-targeted crimes, and states and international organizations urged criminalizing rape with the main argument that the Geneva Conventions provided the context. This led to the ICTY Statue specifically listing rape as a crime against humanity. Under the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> (OTP) of the ICTY, there is a [...] "Legal Advisor for Gender-related Crimes" [...] position that directs the prosecution's dealings with gender-based crimes similar to the one made in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

2500|$|On August 23, 2006, Viktor Yushchenko, the {{previous}} President of Ukraine, unveiled {{a monument to}} Chornovil and ordered a new investigation into his death.

Lutsenko stated further that the investigation is now carried by the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> General of Ukraine and the Security Service of Ukraine, the law enforcement authorities not under Lutsenko's control. He went further, alluding that [...] "certain circles" [...] in the Prosecutor's Office and Security Service are stonewalling the investigation.

2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so you no longer have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Aleppo rebels used hell cannons, a {{makeshift}} mortar firing gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel. UN High Commissioner For Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein {{has stated that}} their use is [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] and constitutes indiscriminate attacks as they {{are very difficult to}} aim correctly, frequently killing and maiming civilians in Government-held areas. According to Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein their use is primarily to [...] "terrorize the inhabitants of western Aleppo". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in December 2014 that between July and December 2014 the rebels killed 204 civilians using hell cannons. Professor of Law Mark A. Summers of Barry University School of Law, a legal expert previous assigned to the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, wrote that both the uses of barrel bombs and hell cannons is inaccurate and so randomly destructive that their use is per se illegal and thus constitutes either the direct or indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian objects.
