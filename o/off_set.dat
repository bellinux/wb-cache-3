25|$|The end of Tabinshwehti came {{soon after}} his return from the Siamese campaign. The king, who had always led a highly disciplined life, quickly {{developed}} a liking to wine after having introduced to it by a young Portuguese mercenary who had just entered his service. He became an alcoholic {{in such a short}} time that the king, who had been on constant military campaigns in every year since 1534, decided not only to forgo any new campaigns but also to hand over day-to-day governing duties to Bayinnaung. Instead, he went on hunting and drinking trips with the mercenary-turned-winemaker, whom he had given a royal handmaiden as wife. The drunken king is said not to have respected other men's wives. Desperate, ministers approached Bayinnaung to take over the throne but he refused. Bayinnaung arrested the winemaking mercenary, paid him <b>off,</b> <b>set</b> him on a ship, and sent him out of the country.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the international development of voluntary biodiversity <b>off</b> <b>sets,</b> a conservation instrument that permits developers {{to pursue their}} activities if conservation actions are undertaken elsewhere {{to compensate for the}} environmental impacts of their projects. Largely undertaken by extractive industries that operate in the global South where no <b>off</b> <b>setting</b> regulations exist, this tool is currently attracting growing interest from policy makers, private companies, fi nancial institutions, and conservation experts. Building upon the concept of market framing developed by Callon (1998), I explore in what contexts and through what processes this idea has gathered momentum, as well as the disturbing gap between the way it has been framed and its practical implementation. It is suggested that once immersed in the outside world, the market framing of <b>off</b> <b>sets</b> appears as a fragile result dependent upon substantial investments, which casts serious doubts about off sets' ability to reduce biodiversity loss on technical, governance, and social grounds...|$|R
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is <b>off</b> <b>set</b> by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E

Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped.

They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show Not Only... But Also. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to [...] "cap" [...] their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the Flying Circus series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that [...] "This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in"—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set). However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, recording his groundbreaking series Q5 (1969). Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often [...] "give up" [...] on sketches halfway through and wander <b>off</b> <b>set</b> (often muttering [...] "Did I write this?").
