25|$|As grain prices increased, China's {{numerous}} small-holding milk farmers, {{as well as}} {{producers of}} feed for cattle, were unable to exist economically. As a result, they turned to putting additives into the feed and milk, including melamine, to boost the measured level of protein. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> became ill, China's milk exports virtually ended, executives and officials were arrested and some executed, and companies went bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|Texans were {{disturbed}} by {{accounts of the}} continued captivity <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and women, especially because of the stories by those rescued or ransomed. They made increased demands for the Republic to retaliate against the Comanche. Under Lamar, the Republic of Texas waged war on the Comanche, invaded Comancheria, burned villages, attacked and destroyed numerous war bands, but the effort bankrupted the fledgling Republic. More importantly, although the Texas forces succeeded in rescuing large numbers of hostages, thousands remained in captivity. Houston was elected to his second term {{in large part because}} of the failure of Lamar's Indian policies.|$|E
25|$|URM was {{established}} in 1980 {{as a result of}} the legislative branch’s enactment of the Refugee Act that same year. Initially, it was developed to “address the needs <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in Southeast Asia” who were displaced due to civil unrest and economic problems resulting from the aftermath of the Vietnam War, which had ended only five years earlier. Coordinating with the United Nations and “utilizing an executive order to raise immigration quotas, President Carter doubled the number of Southeast Asian refugees allowed into the United States each month.” The URM {{was established}}, in part, to deal with the influx of refugee children.|$|E
25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E

500|$|By 1909, {{the bell}} had made six trips, {{and not only}} had the {{cracking}} become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, {{the organizers of the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to millions who might never see it otherwise. However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the [...] "spider." [...] In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds which were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission which also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey. Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after World War I, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4million schoolchildren, for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the 1939 New York World's Fair.

50|$|During {{and after}} the Greek Civil War of 1946-1949, members or sympathisers of the {{defeated}} communist forces fled Greece as political refugees. The collapse of the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) and the evacuation of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) to Tashkent in 1949 led <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people to leave the country.
