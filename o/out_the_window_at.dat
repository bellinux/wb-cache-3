25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted it on an empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> the building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins with}} Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> a {{helicopter}} that follows him throughout {{the first half}} of the video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters and puts the globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends as we see Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs back into bed. The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions.|$|E
500|$|Alex Browning, {{the last}} role cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who {{previously}} {{starred in the}} 1999 film Idle Hands. [...] Sawa said that when [...] " [...] read the script on a plane, [...] found [...] peeking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the engine every couple of minutes" [...] and [...] " [...] went down and met Glen and Jim and [...] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas". However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
25|$|Some fire {{experts have}} {{questioned}} why <b>the</b> exterior front <b>windows</b> {{were taken out}} by firefighters while crews were committed inside, an action that could have increased the amount of oxygen being fed to the fire and drawn flames {{to the front of}} the store. Assistant Fire Chief Larry Garvin stated that fire blew <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>at</b> which time firefighters broke open more windows to allow firefighters to escape.|$|R

2500|$|Baltz {{was taken}} to New York Methodist Hospital, 15 blocks from the crash site down Seventh Avenue. From his {{hospital}} bed, he told rescuers that moments before the collision, he had looked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the snow falling on the city: [...] "It looked like a picture out of a fairy book. It was a beautiful sight".|$|E
2500|$|Another writer {{recalled}} {{the area around}} the Dunbar as [...] "a place where people love to congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo." [...] The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as [...] "the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife," [...] as [...] "regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status." [...] Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, [...] "Everybody that was anybody showed up at the Dunbar. [...] I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, up to the curb in a big Packard, and he'd look <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> all the folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He {{stared down}} at the floor, then <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't even tell you that, sir," [...] he said.|$|E

60|$|These {{houses were}} {{on the shores of}} a chain of ponds, seven in number, the source of a small stream called Herring River, which empties into the Bay. There are many Herring Rivers on the Cape; they will, perhaps, be more {{numerous}} than herrings soon. We knocked {{at the door of the}} first house, but its inhabitants were all gone away. In the meanwhile, we saw the occupants of the next one looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> us, and before we reached it an old woman came out and fastened the door of her bulkhead, and went in again. Nevertheless, we did not hesitate to knock at her door, when a grizzly-looking man appeared, whom we took to be sixty or seventy years old. He asked us, at first, suspiciously, where we were from, and what our business was; to which we returned plain answers.|$|E
60|$|When {{he left me}} I went to my room. After {{a little}} while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, {{inaccessible}} though it was to me, {{as compared with the}} narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me. There was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete. But it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.|$|E
