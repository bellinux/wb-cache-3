25|$|Although Charlemagne (742–814) is {{recorded}} to have habitually worn trousers, donning the Byzantine tunic only for ceremonial occasions, {{the influence of}} the Roman past and the example of Byzantium led to the increasing use of long tunics by men, hiding most of the trousers from view and eventually rendering them an undergarment for many. As undergarments, these trousers became briefer or longer as the length of the various medieval <b>outer</b> <b>garments</b> changed, and were met by, and usually attached to, another garment variously called hose or stockings.|$|E

25|$|The Korean {{word for}} trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in {{recorded}} history {{around the turn}} of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as <b>outer</b> <b>garments</b> or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.|$|E
25|$|Underwear is worn for {{a variety}} of reasons. They keep <b>outer</b> <b>garments</b> from being soiled by perspiration, urine, semen, menstrual blood and feces. Women's {{brassieres}} provide support for the breasts, and men's briefs serve the same function for the male genitalia. A corset may be worn as a foundation garment to alter a woman's body shape. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including jockstraps and jockstraps with cup pocket and protective cup. Women may wear sports bras which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} in the Chach Nama conveys that Chach of Alor humiliated the Jats and Lohanas.

Qasim maintained these regulations, declaring that the Jats resembled the savages of Persia and the mountains. He also fixed their tribute. Jats of Ghasul who had submitted to the Arab rule garrisoned the Ságara and the island of Bait.|$|E

50|$|Kachera {{follow a}} {{generally}} practical and roomy design. It features an embedded string that circles the waist {{which can be}} tightened/loosened as desired, and then knotted securely. The Kachera can be classed between underwear and an <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts. As {{with all of the}} Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it. Considering the hot climate in India, the Kachera is often worn by men as an <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, however it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the Kachera as an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> (on its own) as it is considered too revealing.|$|R

25|$|Undergarments are {{items of}} {{clothing}} worn beneath outer clothes, usually in {{direct contact with}} the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep <b>outer</b> <b>garments</b> from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.|$|E

25|$|Until World War II, {{like many}} other cities across the Second Polish Republic, Kielce had a {{significant}} Jewish population. Before the rebirth of sovereign Poland according to the Russian census of 1897 among {{the total population of}} 23,200 inhabitants, there were 6,400 Jews in Kielce (around 27 percent). On the eve of the Second World War there were about 18,000 Jews in the city. Between the onset of war and March 1940, the Jewish population of Kielce expanded to 25,400 (35% of all residents), with trains of dispossessed Jews arriving under the escort of Ordnungspolizei from the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. Immediately after the German occupation of Poland in September 1939, all Jews were ordered to wear a Star of David on their <b>outer</b> <b>garments.</b> Jewish–owned factories in Kielce were confiscated by the Gestapo, stores and shops along the main thoroughfares liquidated, and ransom fines introduced. The forced labour and deportations to concentration camps culminated in mass extermination of Jews of Kielce during the Holocaust in occupied Poland.|$|E

They met the new arrivals, carried out people who had died en route, removed bundles, and cleaned the wagon floors. The red unit (Kommando Rot), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been [...] "processed". The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (Kommando Gelb), who separated the items by quality, removed the Star of David from all <b>outer</b> <b>garments,</b> and extracted any money sewn into the linings. The yellow unit was followed by the Desinfektionskommando, who disinfected the belongings, including sacks of hair from [...] "processed" [...] women.

500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her <b>outer</b> <b>garments,</b> revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
