40|$|This {{article will}} {{critically}} examine the traditional interpretation of Article 12 EC-prohibiting {{discrimination on the}} basis of nationality-as not applying to third country nationals (TCNs). Different arguments, both for and against this 'classic' interpretation, will be considered. Analysing the question of the 'scope <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the EC Treaty', with a view to determining the scope <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> Article 12 EC, it will be emphasised that this is not restricted to the right of free movement, in that the latter's restricted personal scope <b>of</b> <b>application</b> does not determine that of Article 12 EC. This is all the more true following the Treaty of Amsterdam's partial 'Communitarisation' of policies on visas, asylum and immigration, which tend to apply principally to TCNs. In extending the material scope <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the EC Treaty, this 'Communitarisation' simultaneously leads to an extension of the specific scope <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> Article 12 EC. Working from the hypothesis that Article 12 EC could indeed apply to TCNs, we will then examine the eventual consequences <b>of</b> such an <b>application.</b> © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E

This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty.
