50|$|The Quimby House {{stands on}} the north side of North Road (also known as Cobbs Hill Road), in {{southern}} Mount Vernon, a rural community northwest of Augusta. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, clapboarded exterior, and a modern concrete foundation. The main facade faces south, and is five bays wide, with corner pilasters, and a central entrance with a Palladian window above. The entrance has flanking sidelights and pilasters, with a multilight half-oval transom window topped by a projecting cornice. The side windows of the Palladian trio are also flanked by pilasters with entablatures and cornices above. The cornice below the front roofline is styled in a similar fashion to the Palladian window, and carries around to the sides. The interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule containing a winding staircase, and parlors to either side of the chimney. The staircase has a distinctively carved rail, and scalloped ornamentation on the <b>outer</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E
40|$|Modeling and {{understanding}} the complex elastic-wave physics prevalent in fluid-elastic cylindrically-layered structures is of importance in many NDE fields, and most pertinently {{in the domain of}} well integrity evaluation in the oil and gas industry. It is believed that acoustical measurements provide one of the effective means to provide a diagnosis. Historically, the problem has been researched and addressed to a good extent for well intervals with a single steel string. For these cases, high-frequency ultrasonic imaging has been optimized and demonstrated to yield acceptable diagnosis of the annulus properties behind the first string the signal encounters. However, they fail to provide information about the outer annulus in a double or triple string geometry. To probe with more effective radial depth, lower-frequency signals are used. In a typical double-string configuration, the inner casing is eccentered with respect to the <b>outer</b> <b>string</b> which itself is also eccentered within the cylindrical hole. The annuli {{may or may not be}} filled with solid cement, and the cement may have liquid-filled channels or be disbonded over localized azimuthal ranges. The complexity of wave propagation along axial intervals is significant in that multiple modes can be excited and detected with characteristics that are affected by the various parameters in a non-linear fashion. To gain understanding of the complex wave physics and leverage it to design effective diagnosis means, we have developed modeling capabilities that address the configurations of interest. In this talk, we first establish a mathematical framework to analyze the guided wave fields in a multi-string system embedded in infinite media. We then develop and implement a Chirp Sweeping Finite Element Modeling (CSFEM) method to investigate the dispersions and modal characteristics of the complex propagating signals synthesized over an axial array of receivers. The CSFEM provides for a flexible framework to study the modal sensitivities in a multi-string system with arbitrary eccentricity, azimuthal heterogeneities, and partial bonded interfaces. We have also conducted scaled laboratory experiments to acquire reference data used to verify the range of validity of the modeling approach in predicting the guided modal characteristics of axially-propagating waves in concentric and non-concentric cylindrical structures immersed in fluid. An acoustic transmitter having four selectable, active elements at 90 degrees apart allows sourcing of all guided modes of interest and is located at one end of the string length. Received waveforms are acquired from a single receiver which is scanned axially and circumferentially inside the inner string. The acquired data set is then analyzed for spectral modal content using both Slowness-Time-Coherence and Matrix Pencil methods and compared to theoretical predictions. The comparisons indicate good agreement and provide confidence in the CSFEM capability to accurately predict the complex wave field dispersion characteristics estimated from the experimentally acquired signals in the fluid-filled double string geometries...|$|E

40|$|Three {{non-intersecting}} strings in {{two dimensions}} which interact via short-ranged attractive potentials are studied using both transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo techniques. The critical behavior at thé unbinding transition and thé critical values of thé potential strength are determined for symmetric and asymmetric bundles of strings. In thé asymmetric case, for which thé two <b>outer</b> <b>strings</b> have différent line tensions (or interact via différent potentials), thé strings unbind in two subséquent transitions, which then exhibit universal critical behavior. In thé symmetric case, where thé two <b>outer</b> <b>strings</b> have thé same line tension, thé three strings unbind simultaneously. The critical behavior at this unbinding transition {{is found to}} be non-universal for thé whole range of accessible length scales, but its parameter dependence {{is found to be}} in strong disagreement with thé prédictions of thé so-called necklace model.

5000|$|Common {{tools for}} tuning pianos include the tuning lever or [...] "hammer", {{a variety of}} mutes, and a tuning fork or {{electronic}} tuning device. The tuning lever is used to turn the tuning pins, increasing or decreasing the tension of the string. Mutes are used to silence strings that are not being tuned. While tuning the temperament octave, a felt strip is typically placed within the temperament (middle) section of the piano; it is inserted between each note's trichord, muting its <b>outer</b> two <b>strings</b> so that only the middle string is free to vibrate. After the center strings are all tuned, the felt strip can be removed note by note, tuning the <b>outer</b> <b>strings</b> to the center strings. Wedge-shaped mutes are inserted between two strings to mute them, while a Papps mute is sometimes used for tuning the high notes in upright pianos because it slides easily between hammer shanks.|$|R

5000|$|The jarana jarocha is a guitar-shaped fretted {{stringed}} instrument {{from the southern}} region {{of the state of}} Veracruz, Mexico. Typically strung with 8 strings in 5 courses, usually arranged in two single <b>outer</b> <b>strings</b> with three double-courses in between. The strings are usually nylon, although they were gut in the past. The body is somewhat narrower than a guitar because of its direct lineage from the Spanish baroque guitar of the sixteenth century. Sometimes mistaken for a ukulele, the jarana jarocha comes in at least five sizes, the smallest being the chaquiste, somewhat smaller than a soprano ukulele; then the mosquito, {{about the size of a}} soprano ukulele; the 'primera', about the size of a concert ukulele; the 'segunda', in length between a tenor and a baritone ukulele; and the 'tercera', somewhat longer than the baritone ukulele. Some luthiers are building jaranas of a size they label [...] "tercerola" [...] or [...] "jarana cuarta", but there is some discussion as to whether these represent a distinct size or are merely particularly large variations of the standard tercera.|$|R

5000|$|The compass of the Triple Harp, in general, {{is about}} five octaves, or thirty-seven strings in the {{principal}} row, {{which is on}} the side played by the right hand, called the bass row. The middle row, which produces the flats and sharps, consists of thirty-four strings; and the treble, or left hand row, numbers twenty-seven strings. The outside rows are tuned in unison, and always in the diatonic scale, that is, in the regular and natural scale of tones and semitones, as a peal of eight bells is tuned. When it is necessary to change the key, for instance, from C to G, all the Fs in the outside rows are made sharp by raising them half a tone. Again, to change from C to F, every B in the outside rows is made flat, by lowering it a semitone. When an accidental sharp or flat is required, the performer inserts a finger between two of the <b>outer</b> <b>strings,</b> and finds it in the middle row. Many experiments have been made, with a view of obviating the necessity of tuning the instrument every time a change in the key occurred. Brass rings were fixed near the comb, but those rattled and jarred; in short, every attempt failed until the invention of the Pedals. … ...|$|R
50|$|Mounted {{inside a}} pull switch, {{there could be}} two types of two-position toggle switches. (In both cases the stable {{physical}} open- or closed -situation would be switch in <b>outer</b> and <b>string</b> in upper position.) One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string. The other type would switch to closed (or open) only when releasing after a full pull. With the first type, {{the weight of the}} string and handle could accidentally switch the load intermittently on and off, when still around the initial position (depending on the internal spring). This could potentially increase the danger of overheating in the switch.|$|R

5000|$|A triple harp {{features}} {{three rows}} of parallel <b>strings,</b> two <b>outer</b> rows of diatonic strings, and a center row of chromatic strings. To play a sharp, the harpist reaches {{in between the}} <b>strings</b> in either <b>outer</b> row and plucks the center row string. Like the double-strung harp, the two <b>outer</b> rows of <b>strings</b> are tuned the same, but the triple-strung harp has no levers. This harp originated in Italy in the 16th century as a low headed instrument, and {{towards the end of}} 17th century it arrived in Wales where it developed a high head and larger size. It established itself as part of Welsh tradition and became known as the Welsh harp (telyn deires, [...] "three-row harp").

Coarse features catch graphical and domain information about OCSs, such as logo positions and aspect ratios. Finer features characterize the contour regions using a gradient based representation. Using these features, we employ regression fitting to score how likely an OCS takes part of a logo region. A final step of correction helps with the wrong segmentation cases. We present experiments done on the Tobacco- 800 dataset, and compare our results with the literature. We obtain interesting results compared to the best systems...|$|R

50|$|The tiple Colombiano (Colombian tiple) is an {{instrument}} of the guitar family, similar in appearance although slightly smaller (about 18%) than a standard classical guitar. The typical fretboard scale is about 530 mm (just under 21 inches), and the neck joins the body at the 12th fret. There are 12 strings, grouped in four tripled courses. Traditional tuning from lowest to highest course is C E A D, although many modern players tune the instrument like the upper four strings of the modern guitar: D G B E. The <b>outer</b> two <b>strings</b> {{of each of the}} three lowest triple courses is tuned an octave higher than the middle string in the course (giving C4 C3 C4 • E4 E3 E4 • A4 A3 A4 • D4 D4 D4 in traditional tuning, or D4 D3 D4 • G4 G3 G4 • B4 B3 B4 • E4 E4 E4 in modern tuning). An 18 or 19 fret fingerboard give the tiple Colombiano a range of about 2-2/3 octaves, from C3 - G#5 (or A5).|$|R
