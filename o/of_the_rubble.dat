5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planets.|$|E
25|$|After the Turks had recaptured the Acropolis {{they used}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> {{produced}} by this explosion {{to erect a}} smaller mosque within the shell of the ruined Parthenon. For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were looted for building material and any remaining objects of value.|$|E
25|$|On top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> fill {{were found}} a panel and {{door of a}} large gilded shrine, {{although}} the exact position of these items is unclear., (Keegan Paul, 1990), p. 45, fig 17 p. 110, p. 116 and fig. 5 Additional pieces of the same shrine were recovered from the burial chamber.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the {{facility}} was cleared <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German air base.

50|$|Due to <b>the</b> likely {{presence}} <b>of</b> {{people under}} <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> excavators {{could not help}} the rescue. Vigili del Fuoco, volunteers and townspeople worked all night long to remove the debris, aided by search dogs and geophones.|$|R
25|$|The two {{headings}} of {{the tunnel}} workings met on 4 June 1976 when two pilot tunnels were drilled through {{to the other side}} to check the alignment. Though the official hole-through ceremony had been planned for 17 June, the dignitaries had to be content with shovelling some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> as the TBM had again jammed with loose rock. Mr. L. Dillon, a project supervisor, became the first person to walk the tunnel end-to-end on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable rescues was that of 97-year-old Sharbānou Māzandarānī (شهربانو مازندرانی in Persian), who was trapped in her home for eight days until she was rescued unhurt on January 3. Rescue workers took three hours to dig her out after sniffer dogs found her. Renewed media {{interest}} came to Bam on January 8, when a man was pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> alive. The chances of finding more living survivors following this were reportedly very slim.|$|E
25|$|Proteus, {{like the}} other inner {{satellites}} of Neptune, {{is unlikely to be}} an original body that formed with it, and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after Triton's capture.

25|$|Xining was {{subjected}} to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941 during the Second-Sino Japanese War. The bombing spurred all ethnicities in Qinghai, including the local Qinghai Mongols and Qinghai Tibetans, against the Japanese. The Salar Muslim General Han Youwen directed {{the defense of the}} city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone from Ma Bufang, who hid in an air raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in human flesh splattering a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag and Han being buried in rubble. Han Youwen was dragged out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> while bleeding and he managed to grab a machine gun while he was limping and fired back at the Japanese warplanes and cursed the Japanese as dogs in his native Salar language.|$|E

40|$|Within {{four weeks}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> September 4 2010 Canterbury Earthquake a new, loosely-knit {{community}} group appeared in Christchurch under <b>the</b> banner <b>of</b> “Greening <b>the</b> <b>Rubble.</b> ” <b>The</b> general aim <b>of</b> those {{who attended the}} first few meetings was {{to do something to}} help plug the holes that had already appeared or were likely to appear over the coming weeks in the city fabric with some temporary landscaping and planting projects. This article charts the first eighteen months <b>of</b> Greening <b>the</b> <b>Rubble</b> and places <b>the</b> initiative in a broader context to argue that although seismic events in Christchurch acted as a “call to palms,” so to speak, the city was already in need of some remedial greening.

25|$|Low, Brink, and Robbins spacewalk to the {{asteroid}} {{and set the}} charges. While they are successful in altering the orbit of Attila, they find the inside of {{the asteroid}} appears hollow, and proceed to explore. When they enter a central chamber, they are trapped as the asteroid transforms into a dodecahedron pod and rapidly accelerates away into deep space. When the three recover and can exit the pod, they find themselves on an alien planet, on a central island surrounded by five smaller, spire-shaped islands; in the game's novelization, they name the planet Cocytus. It clearly shows signs of former intelligent life, but as they explore, they find no evidence of any sentient creatures that remain, and the one advanced complex they are in shows signs of long-term deterioration. They encounter a strange form of spirit-like energy that guides them to a particular patch of ground, which they find to be soft and consistent with an opening that has been buried by time. Shortly after Brink begins digging, the ground gives way beneath him, opening a cavern into a subterranean structure. Robbins and Low soon find Brink dead at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his rapping, Nas achieved significance for his poetic use of language. Professor Adilifu Nama of California State University Northridge writes, “With Illmatic, hip-hop witnessed the birth of an urban griot telling hard-boiled tales of ghetto alienation and triumph like a spoken-word of a Chester Himes novel" [...] Author and music writer Todd Boyd wrote of Nas' urban realism, stating that his [...] "poetic lyrics {{are some of the}} most poignant words ever to describe the postindustrial urban experience. His spoken-word like delivery and his vivid use of metaphor placed him at the top of the game in terms of overall skills as an MC and as a cultural commentator." [...] An OhWord.com columnist similarly described Nas as a [...] "genius introvert who rose out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> of Reaganomics to bless the mic with a forward brand of introspective, redemptive street poetry". Princeton University professor Imani Perry also describes Illmatic as [...] "ars poetica, a definitive statement for the art of hip-hop poetry." ...|$|E
500|$|The castle's {{curtain wall}} {{is built on}} a massive scale, with ramparts and {{projecting}} towers still standing up to [...] high (and probably about [...] high when built) and [...] thick at the base. The north, east and west sections of the curtain wall have survived mostly intact, {{with the exception of}} one fallen segment of the north wall; the south wall, which would have adjoined sea or marsh, has almost entirely disappeared. It is faced with ironstone and sandstone, though most of the original facing stones have been robbed out over the centuries; the structure visible now consists mostly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and sandstone core, bound together with mortar. Bonding courses of tiles run horizontally through the wall. An impression of its original appearance can be gleaned from an area in the north wall which has been excavated down to the still-intact foundations, revealing how it was once faced on both sides with small blocks of stone. [...] The wall originally had a stepped appearance with at least two levels of steps on the interior face, though there is no surviving indication of how the garrison reached the top. At the top of the wall the remains of medieval crenellations can still be seen, which probably replaced Roman originals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{describe}} <b>the</b> ice <b>rubble</b> shear strength, <b>the</b> Mohr–Coulomb criterion {{is often}} recommended.

500|$|The site of Köllnischer Park {{was just}} outside Cölln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to {{flooding}} by the Spree. Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known {{at the time as}} [...] "the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were already out of date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the comings and goings of visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (16881740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstraße; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls.|$|E
