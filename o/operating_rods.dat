50|$|Unskilled use of {{the tool}} will often detach the lock rods, leaving the lock {{inoperable}} even with the key. This is often a clue that someone has attempted to break into a car. Newer cars have also incorporated internal defenses against this tool such as barrier blocks {{on the bottom of}} the window, preventing entry, and also shrouding the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> and the lock cylinder to prevent manipulation of internal linkages. Others have designed the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> to be easily disconnected when engaged with a lateral force - as is often created by the lifting action of the tool.|$|E

5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last {{cartridge}} is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is {{now ready to}} reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> spring. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> handle may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|R

50|$|The {{pantograph}} was, {{in keeping}} with most pantographs at the time, spring operated with an elementary head suspension. It featured needle roller bearings at the base and knuckle. The <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were cleverly hidden inside the hollow arms making an excellent aesthetically pleasing design.|$|E
5000|$|The pilot {{probably}} {{tried to}} overshoot {{and set the}} flaps to the correct 10 degrees, but due to the mechanism design this was not sufficient to cause the starboard flaps to retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event). The Department of Transport report concluded that whatever the pilot's actions, it was [...] "doubtful" [...] whether an accident could have been avoided. After the accident all Ambassadors were fitted with steel reinforcements to the flap <b>operating</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E

50|$|Garand's {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 used a complicated gas system involving a special muzzle extension gas trap, later dropped {{in favor of a}} simpler drilled gas port. Because most of the older rifles were retrofitted, pre-1939 gas-trap M1s are very rare today and are prized collector's items. In both systems, expanding gases from a fired cartridge are diverted into the gas cylinder. Here, the gases meet a long-stroke piston attached to the <b>operating</b> <b>rod,</b> which is pushed rearward by the force of this high-pressure gas. Then, the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> engages a rotating bolt inside the receiver. The bolt is attached to the receiver via two locking lugs, which rotate, unlock, and initiate the ejection of the spent cartridge and the reloading cycle when the rifle is discharged. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> (and subsequently the bolt) then returns to its original position.|$|R

50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the regulator valves located on its saturated steam side. The regulator spindle {{passed through the}} smokebox side and the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> were led along the left-hand side of the boiler to the cab. Steam was fed to the superheater header through a 7 in diameter internal steam pipe from a standpipe in the shallow dome. As an experiment, two of the engines were equipped with patent steam driers, fitted in the dome.|$|E
50|$|A new {{smoother}} {{single plate}} spring-drive clutch was now fitted, the two friction rings {{carried by the}} centre plate were held apart by leaf springs. Other changes included Girling brakes with wedge and roller shoe expansion and balance lever compensation using <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> in tension with automatic compensation between front and rear brakes all four of which might be applied by hand or foot. Drums were now 9 inches diameter. 16-inch steel disc wheels replaced the 18-inch wires Top speed rose to 60 mph.|$|E
5000|$|The AK-107, AK-108, and AK-109 {{represent}} {{a significant change}} to the Kalashnikov operating system originally designed in the late 1940s. This system uses a recoil-reducing countermass mechanism with two <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> that move in opposite directions, thereby providing [...] "balance". One operating rod, the upper, has a gas piston facing forward while the lower also has a gas piston. The gas tube at the forward end of the handguard is double-ended to accommodate the two rods. The enlarged gas tube cover of the upper handguard guides both rods in their travel.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July 1968, Trident 1s G-ARPI and G-ARPT {{were struck}} by Airspeed Ambassador G-AMAD, which crashed at London Heathrow Airport due {{to the failure of}} a flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod.</b> G-ARPI was {{severely}} damaged, but repaired and returned to service, whereas G-ARPT was written off. However, 4 years later, G-ARPI would be lost.|$|R
50|$|The port (left) flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> {{had failed}} due to metal fatigue. While the {{mechanism}} had failed, the compensating mechanism {{between the two}} sets of flaps remained intact. The port flaps had retracted but the compensator caused the starboard ones to extend further. The resulting asymmetry of lift resulted in the roll to port.|$|R
50|$|Several {{critical}} {{parts of}} early production M60s, {{such as the}} receiver cover and feed tray, were made from very thin sheet metal stampings and were prone to bending or breaking; sturdier parts were eventually available in the early 1970s. Early M60s also had driving spring guides and <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> that were too thin and gas pistons that were too narrow behind the piston head (part {{of an attempt to}} save weight), leading to problems with breakage. Metallurgical problems also played a part, (blamed by some on low-bid contractors), but after 1970 a slightly heavier part was designed and slowly put into the supply chain. High-round-count weapons were also susceptible to stretching of the receiver and other parts.|$|E
50|$|Generally L-head engines use a {{small chamber}} {{on one side of}} the {{cylinder}} to carry the valves. This has a number of advantages, primarily in that it makes the cylinder head much simpler. It also means that the valve can be operated by pushing directly up on it, as opposed to needing some sort of mechanical arrangement to push the valves down. It may also lead to slightly easier cooling, as the valves and <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> are out of the way of the cylinder, making a cooling jacket simpler to construct (but see below). The line of intakes along the side of the engine lead to the name L-head, due to the cylinders having the shape of an upside-down L. This configuration is also known as sidevalve, as the valves are located beside the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The car's newly {{designed}} A-Series straight-4 engine was {{state of the}} art for the time and returned an average fuel consumption of 42 mpg / under 7L/100 km. With spirited driving the A30 was able to attain a top speed of 70 mi/h km/h (factory quoted). In its road test The Motor magazine achieved a top speed of 67.2 mi/h km/h and a 0-60 mph time of 42.3 seconds. Braking was effected by a hybrid system, with Lockheed fully hydraulic drum brakes at the front and a body-mounted single cylinder <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> to the rear wheels, which despite being heavily criticised as archaic and old-fashioned, were reported to be quite acceptable. The rod system provided good handbrake efficiency and was applied by a lever in an unorthodox position {{to the right of the}} driver's seat (Right hand drive vehicles). Bumps were handled by independent coil springs at the front end and beam axle/semi-elliptic leaf springs at the back.|$|E
50|$|The Mini Nimbus range all feature self-connecting controls, of Glasflügel design, {{for added}} safety {{and ease of}} rigging, and have been {{incorporated}} in all newer Schempp-Hirth models. The trim lever {{is connected to the}} flap <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> and needs to be set only once per flight; thereafter changes in flap setting (-7 to +10 degrees) automatically provides trim compensation.|$|R
2500|$|A {{product of}} Troy Industries the CAR 14 (Carbine Assault Rifle 14) is a smaller and lighter {{tactical}} {{version of the}} M14. [...] Its barrel is 12.5 inches long and it weighs 7.9 pounds. The rifle has select fire ability, a threaded flash suppressor for a suppressor, a tactical rail on top for sights and other attachments, and the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> cover.|$|R
50|$|Though unconventional, the Jackhammer {{can best}} be {{described}} as a gas-operated revolver. Many parts were constructed of Rynite polymer to reduce weight. Layout was of a bullpup configuration with a 10-round revolving cylinder that fired conventional, 12-gauge shells. The cylinder's method of rotation was very similar to the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver, an <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> being used to rotate the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The rifle's {{stock is}} made from fiberglass-reinforced {{polyamide}} 66. At the forward end is the pistol grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip, together with its two <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is the locking catch for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, {{on the underside of}} the stock. Above the housing are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a removable strip of plastic. The rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.|$|E
50|$|As {{built the}} Britannic {{incorporated}} a novel system which allowed the single propeller {{to be raised}} and lowered while still connected to its shaft and without stopping the engine. This was acheived with a flexible coupling and an elongated aperture in the ship's sternpost. This feature {{was an attempt to}} overcome the disadvantage of long-hulled single-screw liners, which pitched in heavy seas. In bad weather the stern could rise enough to lift the propeller partially out of the water, reducing thrust and causing unpleasant vibration. The Britannic's adjustable propeller was angled below the horizontal when in the lowest position, to ensure the entire propeller remained submerged. In shallow water the shaft could be raised to the horizontal or slightly upwards to reduce the ship's draught and prevent a blade striking the seabed. With the propeller fully raised the entire propeller hub and one blade could be accessed without placing the ship in dry dock - it was hoped this would reduce the cost and time required to change any broken propeller blades. The shaft was raised and lowered by a small auxiliar steam engine in the ship's stern, <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> connected to a bearing collar on the propeller shaft via a worm drive reduction gear. The system proved reliable and effective at its purpose of keeping the propeller submerged in heavy weather but when set at certain angles the flexible coupling caused heavy vibration and the equipment required significantly more maintenance than a standard drive system. It also reduced the efficiency of the propeller in calm weather unless the angle was adjusted to be perfectly parallel to the line of the hull, making Britannic slower than her conventionally-built sistership, the Germanic. In 1875, after less than year in service, Britannic was taken out of service to be refitted with the same propeller arrangement as her sister - this work required not only removing the propeller mechanism and installing a new drive shaft but also fitting a new bed for the main engine to change its alignment. Once the ship was back in service her performance matched that of the Germanic, allowing the ship to make its own attempts at the Blue Riband.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a switch}} becomes worn or the <b>operating</b> <b>rods</b> become damaged, it is {{possible}} for the flange to split the switch, and go through the switch in the direction other than what was expected. This happens when the flange strikes a small gap between the fixed rail and the set switch point (whichever is touching the main line); this forces the switch open, and the train is diverted down the incorrect track. This can either happen to the locomotive, in which case the whole train can be directed onto the wrong track, with potentially dangerous results, or it can occur at any point through the train, when a random truck is directed down a different track {{from the rest of the}} train; if this happens on the front truck of a car, the usual result is derailment, as the trailing truck of the preceding car attempts to go one way, while the leading truck of the following car tries to go another. If it happens to the trailing truck of a car, the front truck will follow one track, while the trailing truck follows a parallel line; this causes the whole car to [...] "crab", or move sideways down the track (derailment often results eventually, due to the lateral forces applied when the train tries to brake or accelerate). This can have disastrous results if there is any obstacle between the lines, as the car will be propelled into it sideways, such as happened in the 1928 Times Square derailment. In some cases, the whole train behind the car will follow the errant car onto the other track; in others, only one or a few trucks are diverted, while the rest follow the correct track. In cases where it is a simple siding, rather than a continuous parallel track, the diverted truck(s) can travel the whole length of the siding until it turns back to the main track, where it performs a trailing point movement, forces the switch open, and ends up back on the same track again, with only damage to the switches. This is far less likely in cases of diversion to a parallel track, since switches on both lines will often be interconnected, so to set the switch on the main line to straight-through will set the other switch to straight-through as well (otherwise there is a risk of turning off the track only to find the joining switch is set the wrong way, and running the train through it). Because derailments are expensive and very dangerous to life and limb, maintenance of switch points and other trackwork is essential, especially with faster trains. Another derailment that occurred due to a split switch is the ProRail Hilversum derailment on 15 January 2014.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The HK-proprietary {{gas system}} uses a piston driving an <b>operating</b> <b>rod</b> {{to control the}} {{function}} of the bolt, preventing propellant gases and the associated carbon fouling from entering the weapon’s interior. This increases the reliability of the weapon and extends the interval between stoppages. It also reduces operator cleaning time, heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and wear and tear on critical components.|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{optimisation}} {{is essential}} to achieve cost-efficiency, availability and reliability of supply in electric power systems. The process of maintenance optimisation requires information about the costs of preventive and corrective maintenance, {{as well as the}} costs of failures borne by both electricity suppliers and customers. To calculate expected costs, information is needed about equipment reliability characteristics {{and the way in which}} maintenance affects equipment reliability. The aim of this Ph. D. work has been to develop equipment reliability models taking the effect of maintenance into account. The research has focussed on the interrelated areas of condition estimation, reliability modelling and maintenance modelling, which have been investigated in a number of case studies. In the area of condition estimation two methods to quantitatively estimate the condition of disconnector contacts have been developed, which utilise results from infrared thermography inspections and contact resistance measurements. The accuracy of these methods were investigated in two case studies. Reliability models have been developed and implemented for SF 6 circuit-breakers, disconnector contacts and XLPE cables in three separate case studies. These models were formulated using both empirical and physical modelling approaches. To improve confidence in such models a Bayesian statistical method incorporating information from the equipment design process was also developed. This method was illustrated in a case study of SF 6 circuit-breaker <b>operating</b> <b>rods.</b> Methods for quantifying the effect of maintenance on equipment condition and reliability have been investigated in case studies on disconnector contacts and SF 6 circuit-breakers. The input required by these methods are condition measurements and historical failure and maintenance data, respectively. This research has demonstrated that the effect of maintenance on power system equipment may be quantified using available data. However, realising the full potential of these methods requires the gathering and utilisation of failure and maintenance data as well as condition measurements to be improved. QC 2010082...|$|E
