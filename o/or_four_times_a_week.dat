5|$|Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle {{grew up in}} {{the eastern}} Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later {{relocated}} to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and his father drove him to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Heliade {{published}} his first work, {{an essay on}} Romanian grammar, in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt (which {{was part of the}} Austrian Empire at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper Curierul Românesc. This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, Curierul Românesc had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of Curier de Ambe Sexe; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, Zburătorul. Curierul Românesc was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, Grigore Alexandrescu, Costache Negruzzi, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Ioan Catina, Vasile Cârlova, and Iancu Văcărescu.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, {{producing}} the Noddy in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1998, Atta worked {{alongside}} Shehhi, bin al-Shibh, and Belfas, at a warehouse, packing {{computers in}} crates for shipping. The Hamburg {{group did not}} stay in Wilhelmsburg for long. The next winter, they moved into an apartment at Marienstrasse 54 in the borough of Harburg, near the Hamburg University of Technology, at which they enrolled. It was here that the Hamburg cell developed and acted more as a group. They met three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to discuss their anti-American feelings and to plot possible attacks. Many al-Qaeda members lived in this apartment at various times, including hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi, Zakariya Essabar, and others.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} eight years Liszt {{continued}} to tour Europe, spending holidays with the countess and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in summers 1841 and 1843. In spring 1844 the couple finally separated. This was Liszt's most brilliant period as a concert pianist. Honours were showered on him and he met with adulation wherever he went. Franz wrote his Three Concert Études between 1845 and 1849. Since he often appeared three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in concert, it could be safe to assume that he appeared in public well over a thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.|$|E
500|$|The cinema {{opened in}} 1912 as [...] "The Scala". It {{was the third}} cinema to open in Britain, {{and by the time}} of its closure in 2001 it was the third longest-running cinema in the country. As Cine City its {{original}} single-screen auditorium had been fitted with 675seats in three cinema screens. Before the advent of [...] "talkies", the Scala had a resident female cinema pianist, and the conductor Sir John Barbirolli once played the piano to accompany the silent films. Violet Carson, who went on to play Ena Sharples in Coronation Street, was also a resident pianist. During the 1930s the popularity of the new [...] "picture houses" [...] grew rapidly, with 109 in Manchester at its peak. Many people visited The Scala three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The craze for cinema-going was seen by some as a social ill of its time; school teachers complained that pupils were not doing their homework because they were spending too much time at the cinema. One regular movie-goer at the cinema in the 1920s was Robert Donat, a local boy who went on to become an Oscar-winning actor.|$|E

2500|$|After {{moving to}} Hamburg in 1998, al-Shehhi helped form the Hamburg cell with Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. There, his views {{became more and}} more radical. They met three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to discuss anti-American {{feelings}} and plot possible attacks. When someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, al-Shehhi retorted, [...] "How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1939, the Southbridge Branch again {{lost money}} and never {{returned}} to profitably. [...] Post-World War II shortages and other economic factors led to the cancellation of passenger provisions {{on the line from}} 12 April 1951. [...] After this stage, freight trains were only required to operate three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and as traffic declined further, the decision was taken to abbreviate the line. [...] On 30 June 1962, the 28km section of line between Lincoln and Southbridge closed to all traffic. The Hornby-Lincoln section was then redesignated as the Hornby Industrial Line, which was cut back to Prebbleton station on 1 December 1967, and to {{the north side of the}} Springs Road crossing in 1986.|$|E

In 2011 the [...] "Pizza Express Big Audition with Jamie Cullum" [...] competition gave singers, songwriters and musicians a platform {{and a chance}} to win a £5,000 prize and a residency at the restaurant chain's Dean Street Jazz Club. 7,500 acts entered the competition and the final, which was held at the Addison's Rooms in Kensington on 23 November, was judged by Cullum, Michael Parkinson, M People's Heather Small and other music critics. The winning act was Offbeat South, an urban group of 18- to 21-year-olds from Croydon. The other finalists were Andy Lewis, Elle Watson, Palms 13 and The Yesberger Band.|$|E

2500|$|It took Eakins {{nearly two}} years to paint The Concert Singer. Cook posed for him {{numerous}} times, three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for the first year. Each time she did, Eakins asked her to sing [...] "O rest in the Lord" [...] from Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah so he could observe her throat movements; the portrait's specificity is such that some scholars have interpreted Cook as being shown {{in the act of}} [...] "forming the e sound in the word rest." [...] The opening bars of the aria are carved in the wooden frame of the painting. Eakins later wrote: [...] "I once painted a concert singer and on the chestnut frame I carved the opening bars of Mendelssohn's 'Rest in the Lord.' It was ornamental unobtrusive and to musicians I think it emphasized the expression of the face and pose of the figure." [...] This was a practice Eakins also implemented in his Portrait of Professor Henry A. Rowland, in which the painting of the physicist was shown in a frame made by the artist, with carvings of symbols and formulas related to Rowland's work.|$|E

But one mitigating circumstance can be urged in connection with the course of misconduct which he was now habitually following. He had still grace enough left to feel ashamed of his own successful duplicity, {{when he was in his}} mother's presence.|$|E
60|$|One winter day, when he {{had started}} for a meet of the hounds {{a long way from}} the house--it being his custom to hunt three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> at this season of the year--she had walked into the {{sunshine}} upon the terrace before the windows, where there fell at her feet some little white object that had come over a boundary wall hard by. It proved to be a tiny note wrapped round a stone. Lady Icenway opened it and read it, and immediately (no doubt, with a stern fixture of her queenly countenance) walked hastily along the terrace, and through the door into the shrubbery, whence the note had come. The man who had first married her stood under the bushes before her. It was plain from his appearance that something had gone wrong with him.|$|E

60|$|The {{village of}} Longbourn {{was only one}} mile from Meryton; a most {{convenient}} distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.|$|E
60|$|He warmly {{appreciated}} {{this act}} of kindness {{on the part of}} the commandant. It removed him from the constant companionship of the convicts, which was now more unpleasant than before, as during the long hours of idleness quarrels were frequent and the men became surly and discontented. Besides this he received regular pay for his work, and this was of importance, as it was necessary to start upon such an undertaking as he meditated with as large a store of money as possible. He had, since his arrival, refused to join in any of the proposals for obtaining luxuries from outside. The supply of food was ample, for in addition to the bread and soup there was, three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> an allowance of meat, and his daily earnings in the mines were sufficient to pay for tobacco and tea. Even the ten roubles he had handed over to Mikail remained untouched.|$|E

And I am bound to say that those little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that I ever had to do with. How true is the saying that the very highest in rank are always the most simple and kindly. It is from your half-and-half sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity, {{the difference between the}} two being very much what one sees every day in England between the old, out-at-elbows, broken-down county family, and the overbearing, purse-proud people who come and 'take the place'. I really think that Nyleptha's greatest charm is her sweet simplicity, and her kindly genuine interest even in little things. She is the simplest woman I ever knew, and where her passions are not involved, one of the sweetest; but she can look queenly enough when she likes, and be as fierce as any savage too.|$|E
60|$|Every day {{she went}} to her husband for half-an-hour before her lunch, at which time the nurse who {{attended}} him during the day was accustomed to go to her dinner. He had had a physician down from London since his son had visited him, and the physician had told the Marchioness that though there was not apparently any immediate danger, still the symptoms were such as almost to preclude a hope of ultimate recovery. When this opinion had been pronounced there had arisen between the Marchioness and the chaplain a discussion as to whether Lord Hampstead should be once again summoned. The Marquis himself had expressed no such wish. A bulletin of a certain fashion had been sent three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to Hendon Hall purporting to express the doctor's opinion of the health of their noble patient; but the bulletin had not been scrupulously true. Neither of the two conspirators had wished to have Lord Hampstead at Trafford Park. Lady Kingsbury was anxious to make the separation complete between her own darlings and their brother, and Mr. Greenwood remembered, down to every tittle of a word and tone, the insolence of the rebuke which he had received from the heir. But if Lord Kingsbury were really to be dying, then they would hardly dare to keep his son in ignorance.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Broune's anxiety {{had been}} so intense that he had paid half a year's {{allowance}} in advance to Mr Blake {{out of his own}} pocket. Indeed, he had paid various sums for Lady Carbury,--so that that unfortunate woman would often tell herself that she was becoming subject to the great editor, almost like a slave. He came to her, three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> at about nine o'clock in the evening, and gave her instructions as to all that she should do. 'I wouldn't write another novel if I were you,' he said. This was hard, as the writing of novels was her great ambition, and she had flattered herself that the one novel which she had written was good. Mr Broune's own critic had declared it to be very good in glowing language. The 'Evening Pulpit' had of course abused it,--because it {{is the nature of the}} 'Evening Pulpit' to abuse. So she had argued with herself, telling herself that the praise was all true, whereas the censure had come from malice. After that article in the 'Breakfast Table,' it did seem hard that Mr Broune should tell her to write no more novels. She looked up at him piteously but said nothing. 'I don't think you'd find it answer. Of course you can do it as well as a great many others. But then that is saying so little!' ...|$|E
