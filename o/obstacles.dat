40|$|Background and Purpose. <b>Obstacle</b> {{crossing}} is compromised following stroke. The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantify modifications during <b>obstacle</b> clearance following stroke. Subjects. Twelve subjects with stroke and 12 subjects without stroke participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic variables were measured while participants crossed a 4 -cm-high <b>obstacle.</b> Subjects with stroke walked at a self-selected speed; subjects without stroke walked at a comparable speed and at a self-selected speed. Results. Several modifications were observed following stroke with both groups walking at self-selected speeds. The affected lead limb was positioned closer to the <b>obstacle</b> before crossing. Affected trail-limb clearance over the <b>obstacle</b> was reduced. Both affected and unaffected lead and trail limbs landed closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after clearance. Swing time was increased in the affected lead limb after <b>obstacle</b> clearance. Fewer modifications were detected at matched walking speed; the trail limb still landed closer to the <b>obstacle.</b> Discussion and Conclusion. Modifications during <b>obstacle</b> crossing following stroke may be partly related to walking speed. The findings raise issues of safety because people with stroke demonstrated reduced clearance of a 4 -cm <b>obstacle</b> and limb placement closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after clearance.

The cross-section of the <b>obstacle</b> is considered as circular in shape. Effect of {{the diameter of the}} <b>obstacle</b> on the flow structure, pressure fluctuation and pressure distribution is made. Finite volume method (FVM) with mixture model and Eulerian model have been adopted for the present numerical simulation. Simulation results are obtained for both steady and unsteady cases. Due to change in both magnitude and direction of local velocities of fluid as the mixture approaches the <b>obstacle,</b> there is a marked difference in phase distribution around the <b>obstacle.</b> As the size of the <b>obstacle</b> increases, this becomes more remarkable. It can also be noticed that vortices before and after the <b>obstacle</b> becomes stronger with increase in size of the <b>obstacle.</b> The pressure difference is also monitored.

40|$|An {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) must be able {{to safely}} reach its destination even, when it can only gather limited information about its environment. When an <b>obstacle</b> is detected, the UAV {{must be able to}} choose a path that will avoid collision with the <b>obstacle.</b> For the collision avoidance scheme, we apply the velocity <b>obstacle</b> approach since it is applicable even with the UAV’s limited sensing capability. To be able to apply the velocity <b>obstacle</b> approach, we need to know the parameter values of the <b>obstacle</b> such as its size, current velocity and current position. However, due to the UAV’s limited sensing capability, such information about the <b>obstacle</b> is not available. Thus, by evaluating sensor readings, we get the changes in the possible positions of the <b>obstacle</b> in order to generate the velocity <b>obstacle</b> and make the UAV choose a collision-free trajectory towards the destination. We performed simulation on different <b>obstacle</b> movements and the collision-free trajectory of the UAV is shown in the simulation results...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} go over a {{vertical}} <b>obstacle</b> face, the front wheels are forced against the <b>obstacle</b> by the center and rear wheels.

Finally, the rear wheel is pulled over the <b>obstacle</b> by the front two wheels. During each wheel's traversal of the <b>obstacle,</b> forward progress of the vehicle is slowed or completely halted.

Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 vehicles were produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, and many others.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how to best promote, execute, and manage {{traditional}} foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing in the 21 st century. Accurately measured traditional foot racing has been in existence since the 1600 s (“Running History Story”). Much more recently, in 1990, <b>obstacle</b> racing originated and brought change to the racing industry (“The History of <b>Obstacle</b> Races”). As a result, this study investigated the two different cultures of traditional foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing, and what the introduction of <b>obstacle</b> racing means for racing coordinators of both types of events. A mixed methods study was conducted to examine this situation. 100 traditional foot race participants and 100 <b>obstacle</b> race participants were surveyed at races and through relevant social media regarding: demographic background of both traditional foot racers and <b>obstacle</b> racers, feelings toward traditional foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing, drivers of behavior to race traditional foot races and <b>obstacle</b> races, the frequency of engagement in both traditional foot races and <b>obstacle</b> races, and with whom traditional foot race competitors and <b>obstacle</b> race competitors decide to race. Expert interviews were also conducted to supplement survey findings and to gather expert opinions on both traditional foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing. The findings from this study are important because they provide race directors of both traditional foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing with a foundation upon which to plan future races. <b>Obstacle</b> racing has impacted the industry, but not to the determent of traditional foot racing. Instead, a new demographic of young, single early professionals have emerged to run <b>obstacle</b> races; compared to the older, established business professional traditional foot racing demographic. Each of these demographics brings their own varied set of wants and needs to traditional foot racing and <b>obstacle</b> racing. These findings are translated into product, place, price, and promotion suggestions that race directors of both events can receive guidance from when planning races...|$|R
