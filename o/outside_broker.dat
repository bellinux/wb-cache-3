We examine gubernatorial rhetoric—that is, public speeches—about education, collected from State of the State speeches from 2001 to 2008. In all, one purpose gains overwhelmingly more attention—economic efficiency. As long as governors and the general public, seen enthymematically through gubernatorial rhetoric, define education in economic terms, other purposes will likely remain marginalized, leading to education policies designed disproportionately to advance economic ends...|$|R

40|$|Aim: {{this paper}} applies Wenger’s (1998) theory of Communities of Practice (CoP) to Interprofessional Learning (IPL). Using {{findings}} {{from a study}} to evaluate the pedagogy of one Interprofessional Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme for health, education and social care professionals, we illustrate how IPL can work at the boundaries {{of a number of}} distinct agencies to forge links and enhance understanding between them. Background: CoPs are characterised by ‘mutual engagement’, ‘mutual relationships’, a ‘negotiated enterprise’, ‘shared repertoire’ and boundaries {{with the rest of the}} world. Connections can be made between CoPs through the use of ‘boundary encounters’, ‘boundary objects’ and ‘brokering’ (Wenger, 1998). These concepts are significant to IPL and have ramifications for pedagogical design. Methods: 33 semi-structured interviews were conducted with CPD participants and their line managers. Results: the CPD provided a forum for boundary encounters between a range of multi-agency professionals. The use of a neutral environment, away from work pressures, was appreciated and encouraged participants to share, question and challenge each other. The pedagogy made extensive use of boundary objects around which discussions could be focused, for example joint presentations. Participants appreciated these as a mechanism through which to engage with interagency colleagues and to step <b>outside</b> professional silos. <b>Brokering</b> was carried out by the course facilitator, who encouraged debate, ensured group focus and responded to requests for additional information. CPD participants were impressed with the informal and responsive style of facilitation. Our findings reinforced the central role of facilitation in IPL, identified by Oandasan and Reeves (2005). Conclusions: this paper applies a theoretical perspective to the evaluation of IPL, which has increasingly been called for in recent years. Wenger’s framework highlights issues of central relevance to IPL and has assisted us in producing a ‘systematic, disciplined and critical’ analysis. (Barr et al., 2005). <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mobilizing {{research}} {{evidence for}} daily decision-making is challenging for health system decision-makers. In a previous qualitative paper, we showed the current mix of supports that Canadian health-care organizations {{have in place}} {{and the ones that}} are perceived to be helpful to facilitate the use of research evidence in health system decision-making. Factors influencing the implementation of such supports remain poorly described in the literature. Identifying the barriers to and facilitators of different interventions is essential for implementation of effective, context-specific, supports for evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) in health systems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify (a) barriers and facilitators to implementing supports for EIDM in Canadian health-care organizations, (b) views about emerging development of supports for EIDM, and (c) views about the priorities to bridge the gaps in the current mix of supports that these organizations have in place. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in three types of health-care organizations (regional health authorities, hospitals, and primary care practices) in two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec). Fifty-seven in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with senior managers, library managers, and knowledge brokers from health-care organizations that have already undertaken strategic initiatives in knowledge translation. The interviews were taped, transcribed, and then analyzed thematically using NVivo 9 qualitative data analysis software. Results Limited resources (i. e., money or staff), time constraints, and negative attitudes (or resistance) toward change were the most frequently identified barriers to implementing supports for EIDM. Genuine interest from health system decision-makers, notably their willingness to invest money and resources and to create a knowledge translation culture over time in health-care organizations, was the most frequently identified facilitator to implementing supports for EIDM. The most frequently cited views about emerging development of supports for EIDM were implementing accessible and efficient systems to support the use of research in decision-making (e. g., documentation and reporting tools, communication tools, and decision support tools) and developing and implementing an infrastructure or position where the accountability for encouraging knowledge use lies. The most frequently stated priorities for bridging the gaps in the current mix of supports that these organizations have in place were implementing technical infrastructures to support research use and to ensure access to research evidence and establishing formal or informal ties to researchers and knowledge <b>brokers</b> <b>outside</b> the organization who can assist in EIDM. Conclusions These results provide insights on the type of practical implementation imperatives involved in supporting EIDM...|$|R
