5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields.

The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, <b>or</b> <b>serve</b> as the basis for designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
