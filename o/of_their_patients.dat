5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.|$|E

This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E

Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{the high}} {{incidence}} of suicide in the South African context, the fact that suicide is considered an occupational hazard for psychologists, with more than half experiencing the suicide <b>of</b> a <b>patient</b> in <b>their</b> career and the dearth of post-suicide qualitative research among psychologists, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore and describe the experience of psychologists after the suicide <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient,</b> and to develop guidelines as a framework of reference to assist psychologists in dealing with the suicide <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient.</b> In keeping with a social constructionist ontological and ecosystemic epistemological theoretical framework, data was collected by means of meaning-making conversations with six purposively selected psychologists, with a minimum of five years‟ experience and at least one year having passed after the suicide <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient.</b> The data was analysed independently by the researcher and an independent coder using Tesch‟s open and descriptive method. The present study found that, following the suicide <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient,</b> the participants were propelled into a myriad of acutely distressing emotions. They often described a suffocating sense of responsibility for the suicide and the lingering presence <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient.</b> The participants experienced feelings of guilt and self-doubt, often questioning their own professional competence. The post-suicide process was described as being both a personally and professionally isolating event, due to the sense of having to carry the burden of the suicide alone for ethical reasons and fear of social stigmatisation. The participants appeared to grapple with the paradoxical dance between their personal emotional realities and what they perceived to be “clinically” or “professionally” acceptable. Having gone through the traumatic experience of losing a patient to suicide, most of the participants eventually found new wisdom, which helped them become wounded healers. Based on these findings, post-vention guidelines with practical actions were developed to assist psychologists in dealing with the suicide <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patient.</b> Recommendations are made with regard to suicidology research, suicide education and psychologists‟ practice.

5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients,</b> often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E

25|$|Medicare sets a {{schedule}} of fees, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The standard Medicare rebate is 100% of a general practitioner and 85% of a specialist schedule fee. Where medical practitioners bill Medicare directly ("bulk bill"), they agree with Medicare to accept 85% of the schedule fee in full payment for their services. Many medical practitioners bulk bill pensioner patients, and some bulk bill all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% {{in the three months}} to September 2016.|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} where {{the use of}} a PHR would be beneficial to patients and may, therefore, override privacy concerns. Stage 1 of meaningful use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients</b> with a copy of their health records upon request. While this can be accomplished through a patient portal, this function can also be part of a larger system such as Kaiser Permanente's My Health Manager—a PHR that is integrated into the health system's patient portal. By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled in this program. For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million e-mails to physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E

25|$|By 1980, {{primidone}} {{was seen}} as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{learning}} of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients</b> and coined the term antidepressant to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his pulmonology colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported {{the positive effect of}} isoniazid on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of diamine oxidase, coupled with a weak inhibition of monoamine oxidase A.|$|E
25|$|As {{hospitals}} {{developed during}} the Islamic civilization, specific characteristics were attained. Bimaristans were secular. They served all people regardless of their race, religion, citizenship, or gender. The Waqf documents stated nobody was ever to be turned away. The ultimate goal of all physicians and hospital staff was {{to work together to}} help the well-being <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> There was no time limit a patient could spend as an inpatient; the Waqf documents stated the hospital was required to keep all patients until they were fully recovered. Men and women were admitted to separate but equally equipped wards. The separate wards were further divided into mental disease, contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and eye disease. Patients were attended to by same sex nurses and staff. Each hospital contained a lecture hall, kitchen, pharmacy, library, mosque and occasionally a chapel for Christian patients. Recreational materials and musicians were often employed to comfort and cheer patients up.|$|E

25|$|Many {{physicians}} in ancient history resorted to the inspection and {{examination of the}} urine <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> Hermogenes wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of Andalusia d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the Umayyad empire. Diabetes mellitus got its name because the urine is plentiful and sweet. The name uroscopy refers to any visual examination of the urine, including microscopy, although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. Clinical urine tests today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include urinalysis, which chemically analyzes the urine and quantifies its constituents. A culture of the urine is performed when a urinary tract infection is suspected, as bacteria in the urine are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine {{may be helpful to}} identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Many authors {{note the}} most obvious {{difference}} between the curricula of DO and MD schools is osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their third and fourth years. The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that overall, {{studies have shown that}} spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with self-care. Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare. A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients.</b> The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more prescribe drugs, and many perform surgery as a first option. One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes. Only {{in the last several years}} could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation & Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.|$|E
500|$|In healthcare, Watson's natural language, {{hypothesis}} generation, and evidence-based learning {{capabilities are}} being investigated {{to see how}} Watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems for use by medical professionals. To aid physicians in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>patients,</b> once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations. The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data, notes from physicians and nurses, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles, and patient information. Despite being developed and marketed as a [...] "diagnosis and treatment advisor", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.|$|E
