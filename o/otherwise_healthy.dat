5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals. The informal term canker sores is also used, mainly in North America, although this may also refer to any mouth ulcer.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy,</b> well-nourished individuals. It {{can occur}} in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
50|$|When used to {{make people}} think food is riper, fresher, or <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthier</b> than it really is, food {{coloring}} can {{be a form of}} deception. When combined with added sugar or corn syrup, bright colors give the subconscious impression of healthy, ripe fruit, full of antioxidants and phytochemicals.|$|R

5|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{offers the}} only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. For non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where {{the disease is}} inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. Overall median duration of survival is less than 6 months in inoperable, untreated, <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> patients with tumors involving the liver {{by way of the}} intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic portal vein.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy,</b> many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.|$|E
25|$|Hairy cell leukemia is {{commonly}} diagnosed after a routine blood count shows unexpectedly low numbers {{of one or}} more kinds of normal blood cells, or after unexplained bruises or recurrent infections in an <b>otherwise</b> apparently <b>healthy</b> patient.|$|R
50|$|To Spitznagel, {{government}} intervention in agricultural systems (the subsidization of grain and GMO monoculture production, and the {{excessive use of}} petrochemicals), like its monetary interventionism, distorts and impedes <b>otherwise</b> productive, <b>healthy,</b> and sustainable natural processes in exchange for short term benefits.|$|R
40|$|The {{cases of}} three sisters who {{presented}} with spontaneous pneumothoraces are described. In {{two of the}} patients large bullae were clearly demonstrable. No recognisable associations of bullae or pneumothorax were present {{and there was no}} evidence of generalised emphysema. The cases suggest a familial predisposition to the development of bullae in <b>otherwise</b> apparently <b>healthy</b> lungs...|$|R
5|$|In {{those who}} are <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy,</b> there is little {{evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of the selection criteria was to establish a group of subjects {{for the study of}} gingival recession that occurs in persons with <b>otherwise</b> periodontally <b>healthy</b> mouths. The study sample consisted of 120 patients chosen serially so that the requisite number of 30 subjects was achieved {{in each of the four}} demographic groups: Caucasian and African-American males and females.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} of {{intersex}} with disorders of sex development male/female genitalia may look ambiguous for either gender with phallus {{too small for}} a typical penis yet too big for a clitoris, with external urethral opening in an atypical location, and with labia/scrotum fully or partially fused but without descended gonads in them. Undescended testicles, though, may also occur in <b>otherwise</b> generally <b>healthy</b> male infants.|$|R
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in}} the 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> people.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a UV complete asymptotically fragile Lorentz-invariant theory exhibiting superluminal signal propagation. Its low energy effective action contains "wrong" sign higher dimensional operators. Nevertheless, the theory {{gives rise to}} an S-matrix, which is defined at all energies. As expected for a non-local theory, the corresponding scattering amplitudes are not exponentially bounded on the physical sheet, but <b>otherwise</b> are <b>healthy.</b> We study some of the physical consequences of this S-matrix...|$|R
5000|$|Also, the ASA {{classification}} {{does not}} describe the general health status when excluding {{the condition that}} indicates the surgery. In fact, there are hospitals (e.g. Uppsala University Hospital) that do exclude the condition indicating the surgery. Thus, in such hospitals, ASA 1 may still refer to a severe medical emergency, such as for example a [...] person due to a traumatic aortic rupture (which indicates the surgery) but <b>otherwise</b> being <b>healthy.</b>|$|R
40|$|Paramolar is a {{supernumerary}} molar usually {{small and}} rudimentary, most commonly situated buccally or palatally {{to one of}} the maxillary molars. Paramolar is a developmental anomaly and has been argued to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Reports of this entity are rarely found in the dental literature. This article presents a case report of an unusual occurrence of a paramolar in the maxilla in <b>otherwise</b> a <b>healthy</b> individual. In addition, literature review, prevalence, classification, etiology, complications, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies that may be adopted when supernumeraries occurs have been discussed...|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in <b>otherwise</b> <b>healthy</b> people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
40|$|Vocal cord biopsy {{leading to}} the {{diagnosis}} of hyperlipidaemia A 33 year old man presented with three months of persistent hoarseness with no preceding upper respiratory tract infection. He was <b>otherwise</b> a <b>healthy</b> young policeman {{and he was a}} non-smoker. A benign looking polyp was discovered on microlaryngoscopic examination at the ante-rior end of the left vocal cord adjacent to the anterior commissure. This was biopsied and subsequent histological examination showed a polypoid fragment of respiratory tract mucosa with abundant fibrinoid material in its core, as would be expected in a typica...|$|R

40|$|Aggressive {{periodontitis}} is {{a debilitating}} oral disease {{that results in}} rapid destruction of the periodontal tissues. It has recently been reclassified and ongoing efforts are now being made to understand its pathogenesis and record its prevalence in the population. This case report gives a brief outline of studies that have investigated why this disease tends to occur in <b>otherwise</b> young <b>healthy</b> adults. The mechanisms behind such extensive periodontal damage are discussed. A case report of a patient with aggressive periodontitis, treated in the Dublin Dental School and Hospital, is presented and the rationale behind his treatment is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Three {{patients}} were studied in whom brief contact {{of the skin}} with water at any temperature evoked intense itching without visible changes in the skin. The {{patients were}} <b>otherwise</b> apparently <b>healthy,</b> and this chronic and disabling disorder tended to attract a "psychogenic" label. Pharmacological studies showed that the condition was associated with local release of acetyl choline in the skin, mast-cell degranulation, and raised blood histamine concentrations. It responded well to antihistamines {{in two of the}} three patients. Aquagenic pruritus is probably common, but it is generally unrecognised and may be misdiagnosed. Antihistamines may induce a good therapeutic response...|$|R
50|$|Psychology regards cuckold fetishism as {{a variant}} of masochism, the cuckold {{deriving}} pleasure from being humiliated. In Freudian analysis, cuckold fetishism is the eroticization of the fears of infidelity and of failure in the man's competition for procreation and the affection of females. In his book Masochism and the Self, psychologist Roy Baumeister advanced a Self Theory analysis that cuckolding (other forms of sexual masochism) among <b>otherwise</b> mentally <b>healthy</b> people {{was a form of}} escapism. According to this theory, cuckold fetishists are relieving themselves of the stress of the burden of their social role and escaping into a simpler, less-expansive position.|$|R
