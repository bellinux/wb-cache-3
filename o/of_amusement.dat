5|$|Growth came rapidly {{over the}} next few years as the town saw the {{construction}} of a bank, a public school, a city hall, several sizable industries and a series <b>of</b> <b>amusement</b> parks at present-day Treaty Oak Park. In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it had been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association <b>of</b> <b>Amusement</b> Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association <b>of</b> <b>Amusement</b> Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E

He said {{that he wants to}} restore the Victorian heritage of the pier and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section of the pier was abolished by the Sedgwicks.|$|E
5|$|Speculation that Canada's Wonderland {{would build}} a new {{attraction}} for the 2014 season began {{at the end of}} July 2013 when maintenance work on the western side of Wonder Mountain was discovered.

He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake <b>of</b> <b>amusement,</b> some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center <b>of</b> <b>amusement</b> halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E

50|$|When players land on {{a vacant}} {{amusement}} they must purchase the amusement for the price shown on the board; the player cannot decline to buy the amusement, {{and there is no}} auction. Amusements cannot be improved with houses or hotels as in the standard Monopoly game. However, like the standard game, if the player doesn't have the exact amount to pay the stated price, the banker is allowed to make change. When a player lands on an amusement owned by an opponent they must pay their opponent the value <b>of</b> the <b>amusement</b> marked on the board. If a player lands on one of a pair <b>of</b> <b>amusements</b> <b>of</b> the same color owned by the same player they must pay their opponent double the value <b>of</b> the <b>amusement</b> they landed on. Play continues until one of the players is bankrupted; the player with the most cash on hand wins.|$|R
