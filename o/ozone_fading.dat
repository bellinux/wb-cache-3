40|$|The {{colorfastness}} {{of several}} traditional Japanese colorants upon exposure to atmospheric ozone was {{tested in a}} chamber exposure experiment. Samples, {{in the form of}} colorants applied to paper, dyes on silk cloth, and colorants on a nineteenth- century Japanese woodblock print, were exposed to an atmosphere containing 0 • 40 parts per million ozone at 220 C and 50 % RH, in the absence of light, for 12 weeks. Color differences, calculated from the measured diffuse reflectance spectra, were used to assess the rate and extent of the <b>ozone</b> <b>fading.</b> Of the colorants applied to paper, orpiment was the only inorganic pigment that showed severe color loss after ozone exposure. Several organic colorants on paper also reacted, including the widely used plant colorants ɑi (indigo) and ukon (turmeric). The woodblock print, produced using the plant-derived colorants beni (safflower), ɑi (indigo), shio (gamboge) and aigami (dayflower), showed significant <b>ozone</b> <b>fading</b> only in the blue and green areas, which contain ɑi. Several of the dyed silk cloths also exhibited some color change in this experiment, suggesting that prolonged exposure to atmospheric ozone could pose a risk to these materials as well...|$|E
30|$|Fading {{of museum}} {{textiles}} {{has been investigated}} using different laboratory fading simulations {{and the results were}} analyzed using different instrumental techniques such as spectrocolorimetric measurements, chromatography, or mass spectrometry. Crews (1987) examined the fading rates of wool dyed with some of the natural dyes by artificially fading the samples with a weather-O-meter. Whitmore and Cass (1988) and Ye et al. (2000) investigated the fading of silk samples dyed with traditional Japanese or Chinese dyes by exposing the samples in ozone. Grosjean et al. (1987) examined the <b>ozone</b> <b>fading</b> of alizarin and Grosjean et al. (1988) of indigo deposited on Teflon membrane, the degradation product was analyzed using the mass spectrometry analysis. Colombini et al. (2007) examined the degradation of flavonoid yellow dyes such as weld, fustic, and dyer’s broom using GC-MS and the degradation pathway was proposed.|$|E
50|$|In August 1994, news {{broadcasts}} {{announce that}} the <b>ozone</b> layer is <b>fading,</b> and will be completely gone {{in a matter of}} months. In Africa, millions have perished from the effects of unfiltered sunlight. Among the dead is Connor MacLeod's wife, Brenda Wyatt MacLeod. Before dying, Brenda extracts a promise from Connor that he will solve the problem of the ozone layer.|$|R
40|$|Passive {{samplers}} {{with two}} different collection substrates {{were used to}} obtain an average ozone concentration for 1 month {{during the summer of}} 2002 for each South Carolina county. One sampler contained a filter coated with indigo carmine, whose color fades when exposed to <b>ozone.</b> The <b>fading</b> was measured by reflectance spectroscopy. The other sampler contained filters that were coated with nitrite, which is oxidized to nitrate when exposed to ozone. The nitrate was measured by ion chromatography. Calibration curves were developed for the two methods by comparing color fading from indigo carmine and nitrate ion concentration from the nitrite filter with ambient ozone concentration measured by a co-located reference continuous UV ozone analyzer. These curves were used to calculate integrated ozone concentrations for samplers distributed across South Carolina. Using the indigo carmine method, the average ozone concentrations ranged from 21 to 64 ppb (average = 46 ± 7. 9 ppb, n = 58) across the 46 counties in the state during one summer month of 2002. Concentrations for the same time period from the nitrite-coated filters ranged from 23 to 62 ppb (average = 41 ± 8. 1 ppb, n = 58). Also for the same time period, the 23 continuous UV photometric ozone monitors operated by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control at sites within 10 miles of some of the passive monitors showed ozone concentrations ranging from 28 to 50 ppb (average = 39 ± 6. 3 ppb, n = 22) ...|$|R
40|$|Silk samples dyed with 12 {{traditional}} Chinese plant dyes {{were examined}} to measure their {{rate of fading}} upon exposure to atmospheric ozone. Samples of the same colorants extracted directly from the dried plant materials and applied to watercolor paper also were tested for their sensitivity to ozone-induced fading. The samples were exposed in a chamber to an atmosphere containing 0. 40 parts per million ozone at 25 °C ± 1 °C and 50 % RH, {{in the absence of}} light, for 22 weeks. Colorant-on-paper samples produced from the dyes Jiang huang (turmeric), zi cao (gromwell), and zi ding cao (violet) proved to be particularly reactive toward <b>ozone</b> and <b>faded</b> by ∆E> 10 {{over the course of the}} experiment. Ju zi pi (tangerine peel extract) on paper changed color by ∆E> 5, with an increase in reflectance below a wavelength of 530 nm and a decrease above 530 nm. All but one of the remaining colorant samples on paper changed by ∆E> 2 as a result of ozone exposure. Color changes observed among the dyed silk samples generally were smaller than for the colorant-on-paper systems, due to their darker initial depth of shade and hence higher colorant concentration per sample, to their greater saturation of colorant throughout the cloth, and to the effects of mordanting. Colorant-on-silk samples showing color changes of ∆E> 2 over the course of the experiment include zi cao (gromwell), su mu (sappan wood), huang zhi zi (gardenia), Jiang huang (turmeric), and zi ding cao (violet) ...|$|R
