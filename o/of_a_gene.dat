5|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> {{consists of}} many elements {{of which the}} actual protein coding sequence is often only a small part. These include DNA regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the RNA.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the changes of methylation state and expression <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> in human gastric cancer cell lines SGC 7901 and BGC 823 which were treated in vitro with demethylating agent 5 -Aza-CdR {{in combination with}} histone deacetylase inhibitor NaB. METHODS: After SGC 7901 and BGC 823 cells were treated with 5 -Aza-CdR and/or NaB, the methylation state <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> was detected by methylation-specific PCR, and the changes in expression of mRNA and protein level <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> were observed by RT-PCR and Western-blotting before and after drug treatment. RESULTS: Hypermethylation was detected in the promoter region <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> in both SGC 7901 and BGC 823 cells, {{and there was no}} expression of this gene at both mRNA and protein level. After treatment with 5 -Aza-CdR, demethylation occurred in the promoter region <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene,</b> which subsequently induced re-expression of this gene. The treatment with NaB alone showed no effect on the methylation state and expression <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene.</b> The combined treatment of 5 -Aza-CdR and NaB induced complete demethylation <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene,</b> leading to <b>a</b> significantly higher re-expression of the mRNA and protein <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> than those treated with 5 -Aza-CdR alone (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation in the promoter region is related to inactivation <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> in human gastric cancer cell lines SGC 7901 and BGC 823, while demethylating agent 5 -Aza-CdR can reverse the methylation state <b>of</b> RASSF 1 <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> and induce its re-expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitor NaB had a synergistic effect with 5 -Aza-CdR in both demethylation and gene transcriptional regulation...|$|R
5|$|Dawkins {{first came}} to {{prominence}} with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E
50|$|Diploid and {{polyploid}} cells whose chromosomes {{have the}} same allele <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>gene</b> at some locus are called homozygous with respect to that gene, while those that have different alleles <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>gene</b> at <b>a</b> locus, are called the heterozygous with respect to that gene.|$|R
50|$|Cis-regulatory {{elements}} are sequences {{that control the}} transcription <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby <b>gene.</b> Many such {{elements are}} involved in the evolution and control of development. Cis-elements may be located in 5' or 3' untranslated regions or within introns. Trans-regulatory elements control the transcription <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant <b>gene.</b>|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{lethality}} {{arises when}} <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> {{deficiencies in the}} expression {{of two or more}} genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not. The deficiencies can arise through mutation, epigenetic alteration or by inhibition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene's</b> expression.|$|R
5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
5|$|In transcription, the codons <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids {{more than one}} possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the product <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested}} that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the base}} {{sequences}} regulating gene expression are found outside of protein-coding sequences, either within introns or outside of genes in intergenic regions. Changes in those regulatory regions can lead to dysfunction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene(s)</b> and produce phenotypic effects that can be relevant to health and function.|$|R
5000|$|Lentivirus is {{primarily}} a research tool used to introduce <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> product into in vitro systems or animal models. Large-scale collaborative efforts are underway to use lentiviruses to block the expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>gene</b> using RNA interference technology in high-throughput formats. [...] The expression of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduces the expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>gene,</b> thus allowing researchers to examine the necessity and effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>gene</b> in <b>a</b> model system. These studies can be a precursor {{to the development of}} novel drugs which aim to block a gene-product to treat diseases. Conversely, lentivirus are also used to stably over-express certain genes, thus allowing researchers to examine the effect of increased <b>gene</b> expression in <b>a</b> model system.|$|R
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> terminates. The 3'-most {{segment of the}} newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E

50|$|Enhancer {{trapping}} {{involves the}} insertion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reporter <b>gene,</b> such as lac-Z or GFP, into the promoter region <b>a</b> desired <b>gene,</b> so that whenever the gene is expressed, {{it can be}} monitored by said reporter, giving a specific spatial and temporal map <b>of</b> when <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> expressed. This method again involves Transposable Element insertion, taking advantage of certain transposable elements that have a propensity to insert into promoter regions. This method is also advantageous as such insertions can be reversed.|$|R
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
