25|$|According to the biography, {{the group}} had almost called it quits during {{the writing of the}} album. The band had written about 16 songs in the 3 years spent on the road touring and had {{expected}} to cut the list to 10 after settling down to record in their New Orleans home studio. Weeks of working with old ideas and bickering between the bandmates led the group to begin searching for an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> to help focus the group and stabilize the tension. During this search, the group met producer Dennis Herring and after hearing his input, decided to scrap all the previously written material and start from scratch, bringing Herring on board as producer of the album. The band worked over the next three months writing almost 20 new songs that would shape Armistice. The band then spent time at Herring's studio in Oxford, Mississippi recording the final touches of the album.|$|E
500|$|The band thus {{urgently}} {{needed to produce}} an album to make money. And because the project's 26 tracks presented a challenge greater than the band's previous albums, [...] "Waters decided to bring in an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> and collaborator." [...] He later said, [...] "I needed a collaborator who was musically and intellectually in a similar place to where I was." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Happy Now?" [...] was {{recorded}} during sessions for No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995). Band members Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young, and producer Gary Angle collaborated for the effort. However, after their record label Interscope brought in <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> Matthew Wilder {{to improve the}} album's sessions, Eric became distraught and {{decided to leave the}} group. The single {{was recorded}} at eleven different studios in California in 1995.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{second album}} Solitary Confinement was {{released}} in April 2010 featuring Crooked I, Ill Bill and frequent collaborator Reain. For the first time, Rhyme Asylum recruited <b>outside</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{anticipation}} of an ever-increasing flood of orders from <b>outside</b> <b>producers,</b> Piedmont had overstocked its inventory, {{which led to}} the company going into receivership in October 1922. There was over $225,000 worth of parts alone in stock.|$|R
500|$|For the new album, Back to the Egg, McCartney {{decided to}} {{collaborate}} {{in the studio}} with producer Chris Thomas, with whom he had begun working on the audio for two films documenting Wings' last world tour: Wings Over the World, a television documentary, and the cinema release Rockshow (1980). Thomas's involvement would mark the first time that Wings had recorded with an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> since their 1973 single [...] "Live and Let Die", which George Martin had produced. Due to his recent work with the Pretenders and the Sex Pistols, Thomas brought a punk rock and new wave influence to Wings' sound, matching McCartney's desire to reflect contemporary musical trends.|$|E
500|$|Vig {{had created}} {{a new version of}} their song [...] "Bad Boyfriend", which had opened their Bleed Like Me album, when he had been {{updating}} his home studio the previous year. Keeping to the Garbage formula of incorporating non-musical sounds in their work, Vig used a digital recorder to capture the sound of his baby daughter's swing in motion as a percussive loop. Thinking that the compilation would benefit from the inclusion of a new remix, Vig presented his rework to Manson and Erikson who had been unaware of the new version. Both agreed that [...] "Bad Boyfriend" [...] should be included, but rather than solicit an <b>outside</b> <b>producer,</b> Vig spent a few days finishing the mix. Inversely, Garbage recruited production team Jeremy Wheatley and Brio Tellefario to create a new version of Bleed Like Me track [...] "It's All Over but the Crying"; the band hoped the song would be a possible second single. A rock version of Version 2.0s [...] "Push It" [...] was completed by producer Chris Sheldon.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, {{recording}} engineer Gordon [...] "Commissioner Gordon" [...] Williams recalled {{the recording of}} [...] "Lost Ones", stating: [...] "It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E
25|$|Many {{fans and}} critics also bemoaned {{the lack of}} RZA's input on the post-...Forever solo albums, which were mostly {{produced}} by the Wu-Element producers, other lower-ranking affiliates, or by <b>outside</b> <b>producers</b> such as the Trackmasters or the Neptunes.|$|R
50|$|The Feelies rarely {{worked with}} <b>outside</b> <b>producers</b> and created shimmering soundscapes with {{multiple}} guitar layers and percussion. They frequently played at Maxwell's, a live music venue and bar restaurant in Hoboken during the 1980s, often on national holidays.|$|R
50|$|Jack of All Trades is a 2007 album by Stones Throw rapper Wildchild. It {{features}} {{production from}} other Stones Throw artists, such as Madlib, Oh No, and Georgia Anne Muldrow, {{as well as}} <b>outside</b> <b>producers</b> Black Milk and others.|$|R
500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{remarked that}} Neighborhoods is [...] "a {{different}} beast {{than any of}} the cheerfully snotty early Blink-182 albums, as the band picks up the gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album ... yet it's far better to hear Blink-182 grapple with adolescent angst via the perspective of middle age than vainly attempting to re-create their youth. Perhaps Blink could stand to sharpen their words but it's better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME remarked that it finds the band [...] "completely at ease with its past and confident enough to acknowledge their early work, with nods on the album to moments from their whole back catalogue." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang awarded Neighborhoods a [...] "good" [...] three out of five score in their review. Critic Mark Sutherland noted that while [...] "the finished product is inevitably disjointed, Blink emerge as a surprisingly serious rock proposition." [...] He went on to add that, [...] "While it occasionally sounds like Mark, Tom, and Travis are playing three different songs at once ('Kaleidoscope', 'After Midnight'), the band are still capable of producing genuine moments of magnificence." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press attributed the album's flaws to the lack of an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> and the fact that only a few tracks were written and recorded as a group: [...] "Blink-182's members are still capable of writing good songs, but without a strong outside influence (i.e., a producer) and no real desire or effort to consistently work {{in the same room with}} one another, the amount of truly transcendent, classic material is minimal. Ultimately, Neighborhoods is a slightly awkward entry in the band's catalog that shows as much potential as it does flaws." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considered both a {{hardcore}} hip hop {{album and}} a horrorcore album, {{much of the}} album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs [...] "liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] to the atmosphere of [...] "Amityville". The only <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song [...] "Thank You" [...] for [...] "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart David soon {{left the}} band to {{concentrate}} on his side project, Looper, and his book writing, which included his The Idle Thoughts of a Daydreamer. He was replaced by Bobby Kildea of V-Twin. The [...] "Jonathan David" [...] single, sung by Stevie Jackson, was released in June 2001 and was followed by [...] "I'm Waking Up to Us" [...] in November. [...] "I'm Waking Up to Us" [...] saw the band use an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> (Mike Hurst) for the first time. Most of 2002 was spent touring and recording a soundtrack album, Storytelling (for Storytelling by Todd Solondz). Campbell left the band {{in the spring of}} 2002, {{in the middle of the}} band's North American tour to pursue a solo career, first as The Gentle Waves, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer Mark Lanegan on three albums.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the {{liberalization}} of EU natural gas markets on the balance of power between `local champions', customers, and <b>outside</b> <b>producers.</b> We distinguish between two steps of the reform: 1. opening access to transit pipes and 2. opening access to distribution systems, hence customers. Using the Shapley value as a power index, we find a modest and rather heterogeneous impact from the first step. The impact of the second step is much larger and yields a clear pattern: all local champions lose, while all customers and all outside players gain. As one third of the losses of champions within EU leaks to players abroad, current reforms might enhance the dominance of already powerful <b>outside</b> <b>producers.</b> This effect, however, completely vanishes, when network power is assessed with the nucleolus...|$|R

2500|$|In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia {{and then}} {{going back to the}} United States. A {{performance}} from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as Refuge of the Roads. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: [...] "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record , and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems... He may {{be able to do it}} faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Slade enjoyed {{some minor}} success, RCA Records had higher {{expectations}} {{and sent them}} away to write songs {{to be considered for}} release in 1983. The band came back with two possible singles, [...] "My Oh My" [...] and [...] "Run Runaway". A raw demo of Holder singing [...] "My Oh My" [...] over Lea's piano, was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired <b>outside</b> <b>producer</b> John Punter to work with the band to record them. This {{was the first time the}} band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed to those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval. The power ballad [...] "My Oh My" [...] was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number-one spot. The single peaked at number 2 behind a cappella group The Flying Pickets with their cover of Yazoo's [...] "Only You". The single was a huge success across Europe and topped the charts in Norway and Sweden. [...] "Merry Xmas Everybody", again re-released, made number 20 that year.|$|E
