40|$|Abstract: Consumers of {{electrical}} power are {{most concerned about}} the cost of their <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> and also the level of reliability of their <b>electrical</b> <b>supply.</b> It is thus of the utmost importance for <b>electrical</b> utilities to <b>supply</b> customers within their requirements. This research focused on the reliability or security of <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> from utilities. This is an international concern for utilities and there are many ways of improving the reliability and security of <b>electrical</b> <b>supply.</b> One such method forms the background to this research: interconnected power pools. When a number of neighbouring utilities interconnect their transmission lines, their stability and therefore reliability of <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> are improved. This research focused on a particular power pool, namely the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) â€“ an interconnected power pool between the utilities of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho. To ensure that a power pool remains stable, there are certain electrical limitations on the interconnecting transmission lines. These power limitations are called transfer limits. Interconnected power pools are required to determine these limits to ensure that the whole interconnected network operates within its stability limits. In this way, if a disturbance were to occur on the interconnected network, the network would still remain stable and supply to customers would be ensured. Instability in a network can lead to partial or full blackouts. A blackout refers to the case {{of a large number of}} customers without <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> for an extended period. The socioeconomic effects of many people without electrical power for an extended period are devastating for any country or power pool. Therefore the determination of accurate power transfer limits should be a priority of any power pool. However, gaps identified between the process of transfer limits studies as stated in international best practice compared to the process implemented by the SAPP could mean inconsistent, inaccurate results. This research addressed this problem using a case study on the SAPP transfer limits studies that are conducted in an annual workshop. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of the methods of the assessment of damage caused by an emergency interruption in the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> of industrial consumers. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the structure of direct and indirect damage and to develop an adequate technique for the quantitative assessment of a full damage caused by the interrupt in <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> of various groups of industrial consumers. The analysis of domestic and foreign methodological approaches to the assessment of the damage caused by breaks in an <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> allowed to substantiate the structure of a full damage. For this purpose, we propose three groups of techniques. The first method is based on the standard approach. We apply it for a detailed account of the components of damage (real loss, social and economic losses, ecological damage, indirect losses) with reference to the occurred failure. The second technique is based on the use of three groups of typical scenarios of the consequences of an emergency interruption in power supply. These scenarios have resulted from the analysis of the regulation documentation and statistical data on the basic groups of industrial consumers (on the example of gas supply system, these are production facilities, transport, storage, reprocessing and support facilities). The third method is based on the specific indicators of unplanned coasts depending on the size of the disconnected capacity, an interruption duration and the duration of the restoration of electricity. The second and third techniques are developed to forecast the damage and to substantiate the efficiency of measures for improving the reliability of the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> of the industrial consumers. The article includes the results of the assessment of full damage caused by the interruption in the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> through the developed techniques on the example of the gas industry objects. The comparison of the results of the assessment with the real values of damages from the occurred failures would suggest the adequacy of the developed techniques. The appropriate account of the economic damage caused by breaks in the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> would substantiate the measures making energy supplies for the safe and reliable.
