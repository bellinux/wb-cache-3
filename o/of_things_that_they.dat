Ying-Ying learns that Lena is uncomfortable with her financial arrangements with Harold. They split the costs of their life evenly with a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> share, making their home life contentious. Seeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over {{a table in the}} bedroom and causing the vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying replies that Lena should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. At June's farewell party, Lena is shown to have a new vibrant fiancé, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying.|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson's {{departure}} {{had previously been}} rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told TV Guide that he [...] "went to (the GH powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E

From where he now stood, on {{the summit of the}} ridge, he could look either way, and by the faint reflected light of the stars, or the glare of the great pyre that burned on the central island, he could see down on one side to the ocean, with its fierce white pounding surf, and on the other to the lagoon, reflecting the stars overhead, and motionless as a mill-pond. Between them lay the low raised ridge of coral, covered with tall stems of cocoanut palms, and interspersed here and there, as far as his eye could judge, with little rectangular clumps of plantain and taro.|$|E

6000|$|Gringoire is a play very {{different}} from M. De Banville's other dramas, {{and it is not}} included in the pretty volume of [...] "Comedies" [...] which closes the Lemerre series of his poems. The poet has often declared, with an iteration which has been parodied by M. Richepin, that [...] "comedy is the child of the ode," [...] and that a drama without the [...] "lyric" [...] element is scarcely a drama at all. While comedy retains either the choral ode in its strict form, or its representative in the shape of lyric enthusiasm (le lyrisme), comedy is complete and living. Gringoire, to our mind, has plenty of lyric enthusiasm; but M. De Banville seems to be of a different opinion. His republished [...] "Comedies" [...] are more remote from experience than Gringoire, his characters are ideal creatures, familiar types of the stage, like Scapin and [...] "le beau Leandre," [...] or ethereal persons, or figures of old mythology, like Diana in Diane au Bois, and Deidamia in the piece which shows Achilles among women. M. De Banville's dramas have scarcely prose enough in them to suit the modern taste. They are masques for the delicate diversion of an hour, and it is not in the nature <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should rival the success of blatant buffooneries. His earliest pieces--Le Feuilleton d'Aristophane (acted at the Odeon, Dec. 26th, 1852), and Le Cousin du Roi (Odeon, April 4th, 1857)--were written in collaboration with Philoxene Boyer, a generous but indiscreet patron of singers.|$|E
60|$|Before {{we begin}} {{discussing}} our various new {{plans for the}} people's welfare, let us make a kind of agreement that we will argue in a straightforward way, {{and not in a}} tail-foremost way. The typical modern movements may be right; but let them be defended because they are right, not because they are typical modern movements. Let us begin with the actual woman or man in the street, who is cold; like mankind before the finding of fire. Do not let us begin {{with the end of the}} last red-hot discussion&mdash;like the end of a red hot poker. Imperialism may be right. But if it is right, it is right because England has some divine authority like Israel, or some human authority like Rome; not because we have saddled ourselves with South Africa, and don't know how to get rid of it. Socialism may be true. But if it is true, it is true because the tribe or the city can really declare all land to be common land, not because Harrod's Stores exist and the commonwealth must copy them. Female suffrage may be just. But if it is just, it is just because women are women, not because women are sweated workers and white slaves and all sorts <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ought never to have been. Let not the Imperialist accept a colony because it is there, nor the Suffragist seize a vote because it is lying about, nor the Socialist buy up an industry merely because it is for sale.|$|E

60|$|FOURTHLY, Another great {{abuse of}} words is, the TAKING THEM FOR THINGS. This, though {{it in some}} degree {{concerns}} all names in general, yet more particularly affects those of substances. To this abuse those men are most subject who most confine their thoughts to any one system, and give themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any received hypothesis: whereby they come to be persuaded that the terms of that sect are so suited to the nature <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> perfectly correspond with their real existence. Who is there that has been bred up in the Peripatetick philosophy, who does not think the Ten Names, under which are ranked the Ten Predicaments, to be exactly conformable {{to the nature of}} things? Who is there of that school that is not persuaded that SUBSTANTIAL FORMS, VEGETATIVE SOULS, ABHORRENCE OF A VACUUM, INTENTIONAL SPECIES, &c., are something real? These words men have learned from their very entrance upon knowledge, and have found their masters and systems lay great stress upon them: and therefore they cannot quit the opinion, that they are conformable to nature, and are the representations of something that really exists. The Platonists have their SOUL OF THE WORLD, and the Epicureans their ENDEAVOR TOWARDS MOTION in their atoms when at rest. There is scarce any sect in philosophy has not a distinct set of terms that others understand not. But yet this gibberish, which, in the weakness of human understanding, serves so well to palliate men's ignorance, and cover their errors, comes, by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe, to seem {{the most important part of}} language, and of all other the terms the most significant: and should AERIAL and OETHERIAL VEHICLES come once, by the prevalency of that doctrine, to be generally received anywhere, no doubt those terms would make impressions on men's minds, so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things, as much as Peripatetick FORMS and INTENTIONAL SPECIES have heretofore done. 15.

60|$|I shall {{rather see}} how far these things have lain open to the eyes of, and been {{explained}} by the ancient sages; I will relate who among them were happy in their genii, and who among the moderns, whose examples may be authorities for our belief; I will set down as clearly as I can what perception men have had of genii or spirits by the sense of seeing; what by the sense of hearing; what by the sense of feeling, touching, or tasting; and in fine, what perception others have had of these genii by all the senses, what by dreams, and what by magic, a thing rarely to be met with at once in any single man, and which seems particular to the child, who {{was the subject of}} our last little historical account. When I have brought examples and the opinions of wise philosophers, and the evidence of undeniable witnesses, which one would think sufficient to evince persons of the commerce men have with spirits, if they were not past all sense of conviction; I shall, not so much to corroborate what I say, as to shame some wiseacres, who would by their frail reason scan all things, and pretend to solve the mysteries ascribed to spirits, as facts merely natural, and who would banish from the thoughts of men all belief of spirits whatsoever, I shall, I say, in order to put to shame these wiseacres, if they have any shame left, produce the opinions of the Fathers as divines, show the doctrines of spirits in general to be consistent with Christianity, that they are delivered in the Scripture and by Christian tradition, in which, if they will not acquiesce, I shall leave them to the labyrinth of their own wild opinions, which in the end will so perplex their judgments <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be never able to extricate themselves; and these different heads will be the subject of the chapter ensuing; and will, or I am greatly mistaken, form both an instructive, edifying, and entertaining discourse, for a reader really and truly intelligent, and that has a good taste and relish for sublime things.|$|E

There hovered in the background a flushed, full-chested and tawnily short-bearded M. Dubreuil, who, as a singer of the heavy order, at the Opera, carried us off into larger things still--the Opera having at last about then, after dwelling for years, down town, in shifty tents and tabernacles, set up its own spacious pavilion and reared its head as the Academy of Music: all at the end, or what served for the end, of our very street, where, though it wasn't exactly near and Union Square bristled between, I could yet occasionally gape at the great bills beside the portal, in which M. Dubreuil always so serviceably came in {{at the bottom of the}} cast. A subordinate artist, a [...] "grand utility" [...] at the best, I believe, and presently to become, on that scene, slightly ragged I fear even in its freshness, permanent stage-manager or, as we say nowadays, producer, he had yet eminently, to my imagination, the richer, the [...] "European" [...] value; especially for instance when our air thrilled, in the sense that our attentive parents re-echoed, with the visit of the great Grisi and the great Mario, and I seemed, though the art of advertisement was then comparatively so young and so chaste, to see our personal acquaintance, as he could almost be called, thickly sandwiched between them. Such was one's strange sense for the connections <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> drew out the halls of Ferrero till these too seemed fairly to resound with Norma and Lucrezia Borgia, as if opening straight upon the stage, and Europe, by the stroke, had come to us in such force that we had but to enjoy it on the spot. That could never have been more the case than on the occasion of my assuming, for the famous fancy-ball--not at the operatic Academy, but at the dancing-school, which came so nearly to the same thing--the dress of a débardeur, whatever that might be, which carried in its puckered folds of dark green relieved with scarlet and silver such an exotic fragrance and appealed to me by such a legend. The legend had come round to us, it was true, by way of Albany, whence we learned at the moment of our need, that one of the adventures, one of the least lamentable, of our cousin Johnny had been his figuring as a débardeur at some Parisian revel; the elegant evidence of which, neatly packed, though with but vague instructions for use, was helpfully sent on to us. The instructions for use were in fact so vague that I was afterward to become a bit ruefully conscious of having sadly dishonoured, or at least abbreviated, my model. I fell, that is I stood, short of my proper form by no less than half a leg; the essence of the débardeur being, it appeared, that he emerged at the knees, in white silk stockings and with neat calves, from the beribboned breeches which I artlessly suffered to flap at my ankles. The discovery, after the fact, was disconcerting--yet had been best made withal, too late; for it would have seemed, I conceive, a less monstrous act to attempt to lengthen my legs than to shorten Johnny's culotte. The trouble had been that we hadn't really known what a débardeur was, and I am not sure indeed that I know to this day. It had been more fatal still that even fond Albany couldn't tell us.|$|E
