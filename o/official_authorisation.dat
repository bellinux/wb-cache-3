From 1920 the remaining road work was financed by business man and politician Hugo Stinnes. The circuit including a gate building and several stands was inaugurated {{in the course of}} the first post-war International Automobile Exhibition (IAA) with a motor race on 24 September 1921. Afterwards the road was open to the public at a charge of ten Marks.|$|R

30|$|Specific issues: The {{quality of}} the radiopharmaceuticals is defined in the {{applicable}} pharmacopeia monographs of individual radiopharmaceuticals. Regarding the processes of registration of radiopharmaceuticals and production of radiopharmaceuticals according to Good Manufacturing Practises, similar uniformity is not present in all countries. The Good Radiopharmaceutcial Practice Code was defined to comprise {{the application of the}} GMP guidelines for Pharmaceuticals with the relevant guidelines for radiation protection during production, distribution and hospital handling of radiopharmaceuticals to ensure the safety and efficacy of the product administered to the patient. Over the years the need for regulation of the radiopharmaceuticals became necessary. The discussions lead to the realisation that radiopharmaceuticals could not be considered as something extraordinary, and that the same quality standards would have to apply for these products as for conventional Pharmaceuticals. The first formal systems for obtaining market authorisation for radiopharmaceuticals were established in the USA, United Kingdom and Denmark. It was obvious that the requirements 653 used for non-radioactive drugs could not be applied directly to the radiopharmaceuticals. Most countries have established national registration procedures to obtain <b>official</b> market <b>authorisation</b> for a radiopharmaceutical. In Republic of Macedonia radiopharmaceuticals are include under the general legislation for medicinal products. Republic of Macedonia is a small country and use of radiopharmaceuticals is small. Therefore the interest in registering these products is small.|$|R
40|$|Cell-based therapies {{have been}} in use in {{veterinary}} medicine for years. However, the legal requirement of manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are not as well developed as the respective requirements of chemical pharmaceuticals. Cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are medicinal products {{in the sense of the}} pharmaceutical law of the European Union (EU). For that reason, such medicinal products principally require official approval for their manufacture and an <b>official</b> marketing <b>authorisation</b> for their placement on the market before being used by the veterinarian. The manufacture, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals without manufacturing approval and marketing authorisation is permitted only in certain exceptional cases determined by EU and individual Member State law. Violations of this requirement may have consequences for the respective veterinarian under criminal law and under the code of professional conduct in the respective Member State. The regular use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the scope of a therapeutic emergency as well as the import of such veterinary pharmaceuticals from non-European countries for use in the EU are currently out of the question in the EU because of a lack of legal bases. Here, we review the general legal requirement of manufacturing, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the EU and point out different implementations of EU law within the different Member States...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisIt is a {{well-known}} fact that South Africa is rich with coal resources. Remaining coal reserves {{are estimated to be}} at least 69 billion metric tonnes. Both underground and opencast mining methods are used to extract the energy mineral in South Africa. South Africa uses its coal domestically as well as internationally for electricity generation and heating in the Iron and Steel industries. After the promulgation of South Africa‟s constitution, numerous mining related acts were passed in order to address social, economic and environmental factors in a sustainable way. The study sought to assess the positive and negative impacts of mining legislation in the design and development phase of opencast mining projects. An empirical, interpretivist and simple qualitative design approach was used. Data was collected from mining consultants, government authorities and mining companies through face to face semi-structured interviews. The study found that positive impacts of mining legislation on the budget, time and quality of opencast coal mining projects were: Standardised requirements to enter the mining sector, world class drafted legislation, timelines on authorisations, promotion of environmental consciousness and up-skilling of <b>officials</b> involved in <b>authorisation</b> processes. The negative impacts were: Lack of alignment on pieces of legislation, absence of timelines in some acts, turf war between the Department of Minerals Resources (DMR) and the Department of Environmental and Water Affairs (DWEA), long lead times to issue water use licences and environmental authorisations, insufficient clarity on Social Labour Plans and Political influence on authorisations. Recommendations on negative impacts are: Legislation harmonisation, proper and equal remuneration of staff involved in authorisation, site inspection by authorities, and clarity on SLP and stakeholder engagement...|$|R
40|$|Hospitals {{and care}} homes are {{making use of}} new {{measures}} designed to protect people unable to give consent for their care. The Mental Capacity Act Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were introduced by law on 1 April 2009 to provide a legal framework for depriving someone of their liberty where {{they are unable to}} give informed consent regarding their care. The statistics presented here provide the first <b>official</b> information about <b>authorisations</b> to legally detain a person using the legislation. The safeguards apply to people aged 18 and above who suffer from a mental disorder of the mind (such as dementia or a profound learning disability) and who lack capacity to give consent to the arrangements made for their care and / or treatment. The safeguards cover people in all hospitals and care homes in the statutory, independent and voluntary sectors. A rigorous, standardised assessment and authorisation process is used to ensure only appropriate use is made of the safeguards. Key facts?The number of authorisation requests were: 1, 772 in quarter 1 1, 681 in quarter 2 and, 1, 869 in quarter 3. ?Of the total assessments completed in each quarter, a higher proportion were for females than for males ?For each quarter, around three out of four assessments were made by local authorities while the remaining ones were made by primary care trusts. ?The percentage of authorisations granted leading to someone being deprived of their liberty varied between 33. 5 per cent and 50. 7 per cent across quarters 1 to 3. ?At 31 December 2009 1, 074 people were subject to such authorisations.

50|$|Strict {{regulations}} were enforced before paupers were {{admitted to the}} poorhouse, and written permission had to be produced to the gatekeeper. Generally signed by the local Inspector of the Poor, the authorisation had to be dated {{no more than three}} days earlier unless the holder stayed more than five miles from the poorhouse, in which case the limit was extended to six days. All new admissions were segregated into a probationary area until they had been examined and declared free from diseases affecting the mind and body by a medical officer. They would be thoroughly searched and their clothing removed before they were bathed and supplied with a standard-issue uniform. Their own clothing was steam cleaned and held in storage until they left. If a pauper wished to leave they could do so by giving the House Governor twenty-four hours notice; the simplicity of this led to the discharge system often being exploited but <b>official</b> <b>authorisation</b> was again required before re-admittance was permitted.|$|E
50|$|Working {{conditions}} for a Soviet worker changed over time; for instance, {{at the beginning of}} the Communist regime the government pursued a policy of worker participation at the enterprise level. During Joseph Stalin's crash-industrialisation drive, workers lost their right to participate in the functioning of the enterprise, and their working conditions deteriorated. In 1940, for example, a decree was promulgated and became law stating that a worker could be arrested if he had three accumulated absences, late arrivals or changed jobs without the <b>official</b> <b>authorisation.</b> Shock work, which meant that workers had to work past regular hours, was introduced alongside central planning. During World War II the pressure on workers increased and it was expected of them to take on Herculean efforts in their work. In the post-war years conditions did not improve but in fact worsened in some cases. For instance, small theft became illegal; this had been allowed for several years to compensate for workers' low salaries. The situation for the common worker improved during the post-Stalin years, and some of the worst measures approved by the Stalin regime to improve worker productivity were repealed. Because of the lack of a stick and carrot policy under the Brezhnev administration, worker productivity and discipline decreased during the 1970s.|$|E
