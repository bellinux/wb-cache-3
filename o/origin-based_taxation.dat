40|$|Fiscal {{costs have}} {{remained}} a key determinant of supply chains in India, with manufacturing bases and distribution networks engineered to harness fiscal benefits. The availability of differential tax structures across geographies has remained {{one of the}} key decisional elements for structuring the supply chains, procurement patterns and distri-bution networks in India. With that consideration, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) stands as an inflexion point in Indiaâ€™s fiscal landscape. It marks the transition from an existing <b>origin-based</b> <b>taxation</b> regime to a destination-based taxation regime. The introduction of GST is expected to remove the cascading effect of taxes by moving to a common tax base and subsuming variou...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a perfectly competitive {{general equilibrium model}} of two large and symmetric countries producing tradable commodities and a public consumption good. Destination or origin-based taxes are levied on the consumption of the tradable goods. In both countries, an institutional minimum wage leads to involuntary unemployment. We derive the Nash equilibrium consumption taxes under the two taxation principles and compare them to their cooperative rates and to their rates when countries are small. We demonstrate that terms of trade effects are absent in destination-based taxation, but they exist under <b>origin-based</b> <b>taxation.</b> Both taxation principles lead to ambiguous employment externalities. Nash equilibrium destination-based taxes are inefficiently low when the exporting sector in each country is non-labor intensive. The Nash equilibrium origin-based taxes can either be higher or lower that the corresponding cooperative rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Single Market resulted in a switch from destination to <b>origin-based</b> <b>taxation</b> of cross-border transactions by individuals. The theory of commodity tax competition predicts that this change should give rise to excise tax competition and thus intensify strategic interaction {{in the setting of}} excise taxes. In this paper, we provide an empirical test of this prediction using a panel data set of 12 EU countries over the period 1987 - 2004. We find that for all excise duties that we consider (still and sparkling wine, beer, ethyl alcohol, and cigarettes), strategic interaction between countries significantly increased after 1993, consistently with the theoretical prediction. Indeed, for all these products except for cigarettes, {{there is no evidence of}} strategic interaction prior to 1993, so our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the single market caused tax competition. For beer and ethyl alcohol, there is evidence that the minimum taxes, also introduced in 1993, have intensified strategic interaction. JEL Classification: H 70,H 71,H 77...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{macroeconomic}} and welfare {{effects of an}} anticipated future switch from destination- to <b>origin-based</b> commodity <b>taxation.</b> We set up an intertemporal representative agent model of an open economy and study especially consumption, investment and trade balance responses to the commodity tax reform. The anticipation effects on the macroeconomy are significant, whereas their welfare implications are not...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the incentives for strategic commodity tax-setting under destination and origin regimes when competition is imperfect and commodity taxes {{must be used}} to finance the government budget. Different cases of international duopoly are compared, where firms compete over quantities or prices and markets are segmented or integrated. In each setting the international spillovers of tax policy are isolated and evaluated at the Pareto-efficient tax rate. We find that <b>origin-based</b> commodity <b>taxation</b> leads to a downward competition of tax rates {{in each of the}} models analysed, whereas no similarly broad-based incentives for beggar-thy-neighbour policies exist under the destination principle.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} for the nominal exchange rate of a Border Tax Adjustment (BTA) when there is BTA neutrality. A border tax adjustment is a change from an <b>origin-based</b> system of <b>taxation,</b> that taxes exports but exempts imports to a destination-based system that taxes imports but exempts exports. Both indirect taxes (e. g. a VAT) and direct taxes (e. g. a cash-flow corporate profit tax) can {{be subject to a}} BTA. In the US, a BTA for the corporate profit tax is under discussion. There is BTA neutrality when the real equilibrium, including measures of profitability and competitiveness, of an open economy is unchanged when it moves from an origin-based to a destination-based tax. The conventional wisdom on the exchange rate implications of a neutral BTA is that the currency of the country implementing the BTA will strengthen (appreciate) by a percentage equal to the VAT or CPT tax rate. The main insight of this note is that this 'appreciation presumption' is not robust, even when all conditions for full BTA neutrality are satisfied. Indeed, plausible alternative assumptions about constancy (or stickiness) of nominal prices support a weakening (depreciation) of the currency by the same percentage as the tax rate. On the basis on the very patchy available empirical information, {{it is not possible to}} take a view with any degree of confidence on the implications of a BTA for the nominal exchange rate, even if full BTA neutrality prevailed. Whether BTA neutrality itself is a feature of the real world is also a disputed empirical issue. Therefore, buyer (or seller) beware...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} pursuit of redistributional {{objectives}} may provide a rationale for <b>origin-based</b> <b>taxation</b> in small open economies. The analysis is developed in a simple two-class economy where consumers are classified according {{to the type of}} labour they supply. As world prices are given for a small open economy, the full burden of origin-based commodity taxes falls on the two types of labour. When a non-linear tax is levied on labour income, origin-based taxes cannot directly improve income distribution as the two types of labour face different marginal tax rates. However, the government can exploit the differential incidence of these origin-based taxes and increase social welfare by relaxing the self-selection constraints that bind the non-linear tax. Rather surprisingly, the value judgements embedded in the social welfare functional do not affect the structure of optimal origin-based commodity taxation. The paper also shows that the optimal structure of origin-based commodity taxation does not change when the labour income tax schedule is constrained to be linear, and that a positive source-based tax on capital income may be optimal if it results in a differential burden on the two types of labour. ...|$|E
