Melua said in a statement: [...] "This album {{was going to be}} my 'singer's album'. I had always wanted to do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} game 4 out of 10, accusing it of [...] "strangely lacking in soul, and {{consistently}} failing {{to make you}} care about what you're doing and why." [...] He also found the game too easy; [...] "there's rarely any requirement {{to play the game}} skillfully. You just charge in all-guns-blazing, snap between targets with the hugely generous auto-aim facility and blitz one obliging enemy after another. At the core there remains an enjoyably precise combat system, but EA has predictably pandered to the mysterious demands of the audience of players who want games to be played for them and want zero challenge [...] the sight <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> AI buddies charging around getting raked with gunfire and sprinting away unharmed is a pathetic sight, and smacks of game designers not even bothering to try anymore." [...] He concluded [...] "this is a stark return to the EA of old, where a treasured licence is butchered irredeemably. Lacking both a challenge and soul, and failing to even engage on a narrative level, what you're left with is an overly forgiving shooter with weak strategy elements." ...|$|E
