25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E
500|$|Barry Beyerstein - [...] "One of {{the many}} enjoyable tasks I {{undertake}} for CSICOP is to lecture in Ray Hyman's annual summer workshop at the University of Oregon. [...] Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> faculty at work, {{it is also the}} people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' [...] They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it. [...] They make me very pleased that my fate was to become a skeptical inquirer." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of these remarks, Nixon {{delivered}} his Silent Majority speech on November 3, 1969, calling on [...] "the great silent majority <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Americans" [...] to support the administration's policy in Vietnam. The speech was well received by the public, but less so by the press, who strongly attacked Nixon's allegations that {{only a minority of}} Americans opposed the war. Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan penned a speech in response, to be delivered by Agnew on November 13 in Des Moines, Iowa. The White House worked to assure the maximum exposure for Agnew's speech, and the networks covered it live, making it a nationwide address, a rarity for vice presidents. According to Witcover, [...] "Agnew made the most of it".|$|E

6000|$|I took a {{malicious}} {{delight in}} the mystification <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b> [...] "Go down and shake up young Howard {{at the foot of}} the table," [...] I suggested. [...] "He is a little in the conjuring line himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can mount you," [...] he said. [...] "Several <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> {{slipped into}} the town in hopes of getting some loot, and three or four were shot; so if the general will give you leave, I will take you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wall's {{approach}} to business has sometimes caused conflict. He reportedly admitted, [...] "I {{have been a}} bit impulsive at times and I do want to be more respectful <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> man". On occasion, he has been impulsively generous. According to an anecdote reported in The Vancouver Sun, in 2002 he gave a [...] Rolls Royce convertible to a friend to save him from having to walk to a meeting.|$|E
2500|$|I was now {{faced with}} an {{impossible}} situation. On the one hand, based on all available evidence, including his own earlier statements, this miserable excuse for an officer was guilty of flagrant desertion... Yet the German Army Manual states clearly that no German soldier can be tried unless he is clearly of sound mind and body, in a condition {{to hear the evidence}} against him. I looked up the passage again, to make sure, and consulted with my fellow judges...In my opinion and that <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> officers, Hermann Fegelein was in no condition to stand trial, or for that matter to even stand. I closed the proceedings...So I turned Fegelein over to [...] General Rattenhuber and his security squad. I never saw the man again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2004, on {{the final}} day for {{candidates}} to file to get their names on the ballot for the March 9, 2004 primary, Hall switched parties and became a Republican. He said that Republicans refused to put money for his district into a spending bill, and when he asked why, [...] "the only reason I was given was that I was a Democrat." [...] He also cited concerns with his Democratic criticism of President Bush; he hadn't attended Democratic caucus meetings for some time due to the criticism leveled at Bush, his longtime friend. He told the press, [...] "The country is at war. When the country is at war you need to support the president. Some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> congressmen have not been doing that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was when}} King Heremon ruled over Ireland," [...] she continued. [...] "I {{did a very}} foolish and a wicked thing, and was punished for it by being cast out from the {{companionship}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b> Since then"--the coat made the slightest of pathetic gestures--"I have wandered alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Signore, I {{have lived}} too long shut {{out from the}} good wishes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows,</b> and I can bear with it no longer. The accursed Senate may cut me off without warning, and then who will stop {{to look at my}} grave! Signore, I must speak or die!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Our {{chaplain}} will gladly welcome his reverend brother,' said Sir Francis; and {{as to the}} grooms, one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> shall go {{and bring}} them and their horses up. What!' rather gravely, as Berenger still hesitated. 'I have letters for you here, which methinks will make your grandfather's wish clear to you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this? We have got to understand and I respect both <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> candidates, but we have got to understand that this is not about us personally, it is about what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in", Edwards began to get applause from several members of the audience.|$|E
2500|$|His Bar Mitzvah {{speech was}} {{on the subject of}} the plight of the European Jews and the impact that World War II events would have on Jewish people around the world. He said, upon {{becoming}} a man under Jewish law: [...] "As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my peopleâ€”which now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people and do my best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us." [...] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: [...] "I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand." [...] Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.|$|E
2500|$|Polk had not {{attended}} the convention, and {{said when he}} learned of his nomination, [...] "It has been well observed that the office of President of the United States should neither be sought nor declined. I have never sought it, nor should I feel at liberty to decline it, if conferred upon me by the voluntary suffrages <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> citizens." [...] The Whigs publicly scorned Polk with the chant [...] "Who is James K. Polk?" [...] in reference to Polk's relative obscurity. Though he had experience as Speaker of the House and Governor of Tennessee, all previous successful presidential nominees had served as Vice President, Secretary of State, or as a high-ranking general. Polk {{has been described as}} the first [...] "dark horse" [...] presidential nominee, but his nomination was less of a surprise than that of many future presidential nominees such as Franklin Pierce. Despite his party's gibes, Henry Clay, the Whig presidential nominee and former Secretary of State, recognized that Polk could unify the Democrats for the 1844 election.|$|E

We have a strict rule of our own which is no respecter of persons, as de Pombal here could tell you. Do you truss him and lay him on the faggots, de Pombal, and I will return to see him die." ...|$|R
60|$|There is one puzzling {{thing about}} these prehistoric {{memories}} of mine. It is the vagueness {{of the time}} element. I lo not always know the order of events;--or can I tell, between some events, whether one, two, or {{four or five years}} have elapsed. I can only roughly tell the passage of time by judging the changes in the appearance and pursuits <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While {{pursuing}} his naval career, Luttrell {{also took}} the opportunity to follow his father and older brothers into politics. His brother John had held the seat of Stockbridge with his father, but vacated it in 1775 for James. James contested and won the seat at the by-election on 16 December 1775. He followed his family's stance in opposing the war which broke out with the American colonies, and promoted reconciliation, arguing that [...] "I cannot agree to vote away the lives and properties <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> subjects, merely for the purpose of enriching and aggrandising a few favourites and flatterers placed near the throne." [...] He nevertheless supported strong war measures against France and Spain when they entered the war on the American side. Luttrell's father, by now created Lord Irnham, negotiated advancement in the navy for his son, in exchange for political support, but his desire to be advanced to captain clashed with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, who argued that a post-captaincy in home waters was [...] "utterly impractical", but offered instead a recommendation to the commander in chief on one of the foreign stations.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative Party {{would have}} to, preferably {{at the next}} election, ask: [...] "Do you intend still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the {{policies}} of your government?" [...] Five days after this speech, in an interview for The Daily Telegraph, Thatcher praised Powell: [...] "I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully.... I always {{think it was a}} tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that even though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me". On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell claimed that the government should admit that the community charge was [...] "a disaster" [...] and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern Britain and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled [...] "dictatorial" [...] for wanting to [...] "go it alone" [...] in Europe: [...] "Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> countrymen... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good". This was the first election since 1970 that Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party. However, the Labour Party won the seat from the Conservative Party, mainly because of the community charge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{returned}} the maiden, meekly, and slightly disgusted with his jargon, [...] "I {{pretend not to}} judge of either events, or the intentions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> creatures, much less of those of Omnipotence." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the years}} '79 and '80, while Burton and I {{had been living}} our {{carefree}} jocund life at the Seminary, a series of crop failures had profoundly affected the county, producing a feeling of unrest and bitterness in the farmers which {{was to have a}} far-reaching effect on my fortunes as well as upon those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b> For two years the crop had been almost wholly destroyed by chinch bugs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{think the}} matter over, {{and talk with}} my wife," [...] said Mr. Shelby. [...] "Meantime, Haley, {{if you want the}} matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of, you'd best not let your {{business}} in this neighborhood be known. It will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly quiet business getting away any <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows,</b> if they know it, I'll promise you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you. This evening after the assault I chanced {{to walk with}} some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows,</b> round yonder small fort upon the knoll {{to see if we}} could spy a weak spot in it. Some of them came to the wall to curse us, and among them whom should I see but a big man with a white face, red hair and a touch of Anthony's fire upon his cheek? What make you of that, Squire Nigel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{following}} letter being a panegyric upon me for {{a quality}} which every man may attain, an acknowledgment of his faults; I thought it for the good <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> writers to publish it." [...] [T.S.]] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The ship laboureth--the sea is grievous and contrary," [...] {{replied the}} lad; [...] "and by what I can learn <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> that steereth us, we shall do well, indeed, if we come dryshod to land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what book is it?" [...] said Bletson, {{his pale}} cheek {{colouring}} with {{the shame of}} detection. [...] "Oh! the Bible!"

6000|$|... "I deny it," [...] {{said the}} Earl, {{becoming}} quite energetic as he defended his order. [...] "I deny it utterly. I know no class {{of men who}} do work more useful or more honest. Am I a drone? Have I been so from my youth upwards? I have always worked, either in the one House or in the other, and those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> with whom I have been most intimate have worked also.

50|$|After {{they had}} charged our regt four {{different}} times - {{and had been}} repulsed - {{the next time they}} came through the brush and go up to within 20 paces before we saw them - and the officers hollowed to us - damn you - aint you Rebels going to run - one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> - replied - no damn you we aint and then we give them such a terrific fire they could not withstand it and ran themselves. Our regt repulsed eight heavy and furious charges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Useless? I deny it," [...] replied Smith. [...] "Every one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> does {{something}} or other so exquisitely, that it were sin to make him do anything else--it is your jacks-of-all-trades who are masters of none.--But hark to Chaubert's signal. The coxcomb is twangling it on the lute, {{to the tune of}} Eveillez-vous, belle endormie.--Come, Master What d'ye call (addressing Peveril),--get ye some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hand, as Betterton says in the play; for Chaubert's cookery is like Friar Bacon's Head--time is--time was--time will soon be no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said coldly, [...] "that you {{are aware}} of what my {{feelings}} and desired course of action have been with regard to those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It seems to me that I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went into}} prison one man, I came out another. While I live, I shall {{never be able}} to think kindly again of a single one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> creatures.

6000|$|... "I {{can only}} suppose," [...] {{continued}} Mark, [...] "that I have inherited the enmity they bore him, as I inherited the jewels, {{and that the}} attack was really designed solely against me, and the consequences might have been fatal to me {{had it not been}} for the strength and courage <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> passengers." ...|$|E
60|$|The name <b>of</b> <b>my</b> theme, (which {{was made}} public {{for the first time}} in the little programme) is worthy of a moment's emphasis. Going West had been suggested, of course by the {{emigration}} fever, then at its height, and upon it I had lavished a great deal of anxious care. As an oration it was all very excited and very florid, but it had some stirring ideas in it and coming in the midst of the profound political discourses <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> and the formal essays of the girls, it seemed much more singular and revolutionary, both in form and in substance, than it really was.|$|R
60|$|I wormed {{my way to}} the old man's {{side with}} never a doubt but that the great wheel would yield on the instant to the power <b>of</b> <b>my</b> young and {{vigorous}} muscles. Nor was my belief mere vanity, for always had my physique been the envy and despair <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b> And for that very reason it had waxed even greater than nature had intended, since my natural pride in my great strength had led me to care for and develop my body and my muscles by every means within my power. What with boxing, football, and baseball, I had been in training since childhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was thus," [...] {{commenced}} the prisoner.
