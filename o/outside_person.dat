5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any <b>outside</b> <b>person.</b> Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E

The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden.

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the day after the funeral the Duke and his guest met, almost {{for the first time since}} the sad event. There had been just a pressure of the hand, just a glance of compassion, just some murmur of deep sorrow,--but there had been no real speech between them. Now he had sent for her, and she went down to him in the room in which he commonly sat at work. He was seated at his table when she entered, but there was no book open before him, and no pen ready to his hand. He was dressed of course in black. That, indeed, was usual with him, but now the tailor by his funereal art had added some deeper dye of blackness to his appearance. When he rose and turned to her she thought that he had at once become an old man. His hair was grey in parts, and he had never accustomed himself to use that skill in managing his <b>outside</b> <b>person</b> by which many men are able to preserve for themselves a look, if not of youth, at any rate of freshness. He was thin, of an adust complexion, and had acquired a habit of stooping which, when he was not excited, gave him an appearance of age. All that was common to him; but now it was so much exaggerated that he who was not yet fifty might have been taken to be over sixty.|$|E

6000|$|So far I have {{discussed}} only {{the possibility of}} divorce without offences, the sort of divorce that arises out of estrangement and incompatibilities. But divorce, {{as it is known}} in most Christian countries, has a punitive element, and is obtained through the failure of one of the parties to observe the conditions of the bond and the determination of the other to exact suffering. Divorce as it exists at present is not a readjustment but a revenge. It is the nasty exposure of a private wrong. In England a husband may divorce his wife for a single act of infidelity, and {{there can be little doubt}} that we are on the eve of an equalisation of the law in this respect. I will confess I consider this an extreme concession to the passion of jealousy, and one likely to tear off the roof from many a family of innocent children. Only infidelity leading to supposititious children in the case of the wife, or infidelity obstinately and offensively persisted in or endangering health in the case of the husband, really injure the home sufficiently to justify a divorce on the assumptions of our present argument. If we are going to make the welfare of the children our criterion in these matters, then our divorce law does in this direction already go too far. A husband or wife may do far more injury to the home by constantly neglecting it for the companionship of some <b>outside</b> <b>person</b> with whom no [...] "matrimonial offence" [...] is ever committed. Of course, if our divorce law exists mainly for the gratification of the fiercer sexual resentments, well and good, but if that is so, let us abandon our pretence that marriage is an institution for the establishment and protection of homes. And while on the one hand existing divorce laws appear to be obsessed by sexual offences, other things of far more evil effect upon the home go without a remedy. There are, for example, desertion, domestic neglect, cruelty to the children drunkenness or harmful drug-taking, indecency of living and uncontrollable extravagance. I cannot conceive how any logical mind, having once admitted the principle of divorce, can hesitate at making these entirely home-wrecking things the basis of effective pleas. But in another direction, some strain of sentimentality in my nature makes me hesitate to go with the great majority of divorce law reformers. I cannot bring myself to agree that either a long term of imprisonment or the misfortune of insanity should in itself justify a divorce. I admit the social convenience, but I wince at the thought of those tragic returns of the dispossessed. So far as insanity goes, I perceive that the cruelty of the law would but endorse the cruelty of nature. But I do not like men to endorse the cruelty of nature.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{frustrating}} {{legal battles}} {{that accompanied the}} recording of their 1975 album Sabotage, Black Sabbath chose Miami's Criteria Studios for the making of Technical Ecstasy, which continued the band's separation from its signature doom and darkness {{that had been a}} trademark of the sound of their earlier albums. Writing in the July 2001 issue of Guitar World Dan Epstein noted, [...] "The sessions proved extremely relaxing for everyone except Iommi, who was left to oversee the production while the others sunned themselves on the beach." [...] Iommi explained to Guitar World in 1992, [...] "We recorded the album in Miami, and nobody would take responsibility for the production. No one wanted to bring in an <b>outside</b> <b>person</b> for help, and no one wanted the whole band to produce it. So they left it all to me!" [...] In the liner notes to the band's 1998 live album Reunion, Phil Alexander writes that while the band were struggling to finish the album [...] "rock had spawned a new set of iconoclasts as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned led the UK rock explosion. Suddenly Sabbath found themselves both unsure of their musical direction and labeled as has-beens." [...] "It's not like now: If you're a heavy metal band, you put out a heavy metal album," [...] Butler explained to Uncut in 2014. [...] "Back then, you had to at least try to be modern and keep up. Punk was massive then and we felt that our time had come and gone." [...] To make matters worse for the band, manager Don Arden began spending more of his time focusing on another one of his acts, ELO, whose 1975 album Face The Music was their first to make the US top ten. Iommi's determination to move Sabbath into a new direction was misguided according to some, with Mick Wall noting in the 2013 book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe that while future soft rock million-sellers Hotel California and Rumours were just around the corner, [...] "to try and force that sound on Black Sabbath was like trying to put lamb's wool on a suit of armour.

40|$|Social {{scientists}} and many biologists are all preoccupied {{in different ways}} with the nature and effects of the ways incentives influence behavior. One type of incentive is clearly intrinsic; it originates within a person and is often linked to exploratory behavior, hedonic pleasure from self-determined mastery, and desire to satisfy curiosity {{for its own sake}} (1). Another type of incentive is extrinsic; typically, it is designed and administered by an <b>outside</b> <b>person</b> or authority, is precise, and is usually financial, tied to fame, or has some other kind of monetizable status. Because of its various natures, intrinsic motivation is difficult to measure and observe. An adventurous step is to measure brain activity during conditions of apparent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Murayama et al. (2) do exactly this. Their results are striking evidence for a phenomenon often noted in social psychology— namely, extrinsic incentives (e. g., pay) can undermine intrinsic incentives (e. g., fun) ...|$|E
