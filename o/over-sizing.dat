50|$|A {{constant}} power supply is ideal if accurate or maximum torque is requiried from a coupling. If a non regulated power supply is used, the magnetic flux will degrade, as {{the resistance of}} the coil goes up. Basically, the hotter the coil gets the lower the torque will be, by about an average of 8% for every 20 °C. If the temperature is fairly constant, but there may not be enough service factor in your design for minor temperature fluctuation. <b>Over-sizing,</b> the clutch would compensate for minor flux. This will allow the use a rectified power supply which is far less expensive than a constant current supply.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{response}} of {{ground source heat pumps}} coupled to vertical closed loop arrays in UK domestic applications are investigated in this article. Two typical UK house types are {{selected as the}} vehicle for the study and a detailed dynamic thermal modelling method is used to arrive at time-series heating demands for the two houses. A new empirical heat pump model is derived using experimental data taking into account the deteriorating performance of the heat pump during periods of light load. The heat pump model is incorporated into an existing numerical ground model and completed with a classical effectiveness type heat exchange model of the closed loop array. The model is used to analyse array sizing and performance over an extended time period, as well as sensitivity of the design to soil conductivity and borehole heat exchanger resistance and sensitivity to <b>over-sizing</b> and part-load behavior of the heat pump. Results show that the UK’s standard for ground source design (the Microgeneration Certification Scheme) may lead to under-estimated array sizes and that heating system <b>over-sizing</b> and deleterious part-load heat pump performance can add up to 20 % to the electrical consumption of these systems...|$|E

On average the estimated paybacks of 3. 8 years are in the same range as the measured paybacks of 5. 06 years. The average investment for the agencies with completed retrofits as of December 1993 was $ 2. 43 per square foot with the largest majority of sites in the $ 2 to $ 3 per square foot range. Thirteen sites which contained Constant Volume to Variable Air Volume air-handler retrofits were further evaluated to determine why some sites were good performers and why some were not. A detailed analysis of the hourly before/after air-handler electricity consumption indicates that fan <b>over-sizing</b> plays a major role in the cost effectiveness of these retrofits.

Finally, some suggestions are developed to minimise both the extent of, and the negative impacts of, HVAC system <b>over-sizing,</b> for example: • Challenge “rules of thumb” and/or brief requirements which may be out of date. • Conduct an accurate load estimate, using AIRAH design data, specific to project location, and then resist the temptation to apply “safety factors • Use a load estimation program that accounts for thermal storage and diversification of peak loads for each zone and air handling system. • Select chiller sizes and staged or variable speed pumps and fans to ensure good part load performance. • Allow for unknown future tenancies by designing flexibility into the system, not by <b>over-sizing.</b> For example, generous sizing of distribution pipework and ductwork will allow available capacity to be redistributed. • Provide an auxiliary tenant condenser water loop to handle high load areas. • Consider using an Integrated Design Process, build an integrated load and energy use simulation model and test different operational scenarios • Use comprehensive Life Cycle Cost analysis for selection of the most optimal design solutions.

Options for breakers in MVDC systems include <b>over-sizing</b> traditional ac breakers, hybrid mechanical/semiconductor breakers, and solid-state breakers. The recently introduced z-source breaker is most similar to the solid-state breaker, but has the additional feature of automatically responding to faults quickly and without the need for fault detection.
