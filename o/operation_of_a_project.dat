40|$|AbstractIn 2004, {{injection}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) to be stored at depth began at the In Salah Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) site and a pilot microseismic monitoring array was installed in 2009. The In Salah project presents an unusual dataset {{since it is the}} first major non-Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) CCS project to be monitored for microseismicity. This paper outlines an extensive seismological study using a range of techniques, relying mainly on data from a single three-component geophone. Important information is derived from the data, such as event locations, event magnitudes and fracture characteristics, {{that could be used in}} real-time to regulate the geomechanical response of a site to CO 2 injection. The event rate closely follows the CO 2 injection rate, with a total of 9506 seismic events detected. The locations for a carefully selected subset of events are estimated to occur at or below the injection interval, thereby ruling out fault or fracture activation caused by CO 2 migration at shallow depths. A very small number of events (11) with less well-constrained locations may have occurred above the injection interval. However, there is no microseismic evidence that these events are correlated with CO 2 injection and we suggest they are caused by stress transfer rather than CO 2 migration into the caprock. The observed maximum moment magnitude, Mw= 1. 7, is consistent with estimated fracture dimensions at the injection depth. Fracture orientation estimated using shear-wave splitting analysis is approximately NW-SE, in agreement with fracture orientations inferred from logging data. During periods of high injection rates the degree of anisotropy increases slightly and then falls back to original values when injection rates fall. This implies the CO 2 is opening pre-existing fractures which then close as pressure decreases. This an important proof-of-concept study that proves the value of microseismic monitoring of CCS projects, even with a limited array. We thus recommend that microseismic monitoring arrays are installed prior to CO 2 injection at future CCS sites to enhance our understanding by making baseline and comparative studies possible. This would also provide real-time monitoring of the geomechanical response to injection, allowing operators to modify injection parameters and to help ensure the safe <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractInjection {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) to be stored at depth at the In Salah Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) site began in 2004 with the {{subsequent}} installation of a pilot microseismic monitoring well in 2009. The project {{is one of only}} two industrial-scale storage projects to have been monitored for microseismicity. Such projects are vital to demonstrate the validity of CCS technology and the role of microseismic monitoring, a technology {{that could be used in}} real-time to regulate the geomechanical response of a site to CO 2 injection. Substantial microseismicity (over 9000 events) was recorded by a single three-component geophone situated at 80 m deep almost directly above one of the In Salah injection wells. The events occur in two main clusters with estimated locations of well- recorded events within one of these clusters to be within 1 km horizontal distance from the geophone and between 2. 1 km and 2. 7 km deep, at least 200 m below the injection depth and CO 2 storage interval. Errors in the depth range of event locations are investigated using modified velocity models, revealing that 10 % slower velocities create uncertainties up to 450 m in depth. Alternatively, 20 % slower velocities in the shallow sub-surface or an anisotropic model have a similar effect. Independent of the absolute depth, there is no migration of event locations to shallower depths with time. Evidence from the analysis of shear-wave splitting delay times implies that, between 2009 and 2011, CO 2 injection is opening pre-existing fractures that then close as pressure decreases, rather that creating new fractures. The estimated dominant fracture orientation is approximately NW-SE, in agreement with fracture orientations inferred from logging data, and the observed maximum moment magnitude, MW = 1. 7, is also consistent with estimated pre-existing fracture dimensions at the injection depth. This work demonstrates the value of microseismic monitoring of CCS projects, even with a limited array, but an accurate velocity model is critical to allow reliable interpretation of the data. We recommend that microseismic monitoring is conducted prior to CO 2 injection at future CCS sites to enable baseline and comparative studies.

We use standard contingent claim analysis and risk-neutral valuation to solve the problem for a fixed sequence, taking as an input the stochastic process that regulates the dynamics of futures prices. Our solution method works in two steps. First, we consider a fixed production capacity and use dynamic programming to compute upper and lower bounds for the value function in terms of the spot price and mineralogical characteristics of the blocks. We use these bounds to obtain an approximation that is asymptotically optimal as the spot price grows large. In the second step, we extend this asymptotic approximation to handle capacity expansion decisions. Numerical computations are used to evaluate the performance of our proposed policy.

These are large-scale, complex, and capital-intensive engineering systems, which until recently, were developed and operated either by the public or the private sector. The latest model for the construction and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infrastructure <b>project</b> is Public-Private Partnerships ("PPP"), a hybrid structure that is becoming widespread. PPP employ private companies to construct and then operate infrastructure assets, which historically have been financed with public resources and operated on a not-for-profit basis. Through PPP agreements such as concessions, governments shift construction and operating risks to the private sector, which is usually more efficient in building and then running the assets. <b>Project</b> finance is <b>a</b> large and rapidly growing subfield of finance, yet one where academic theory and research distantly lag current practice. Project finance relies on private capital sources for financing the PPP infrastructure project, as opposed to direct government financing or corporate financing. (cont.) The thesis hypothesis is that project finance constitutes the most robust and sophisticated financial mechanism for maximizing return on investment and mitigating risk in PPP infrastructure projects. It {{is the goal of}} this thesis to provide the organizational methodology, financial application, risk management techniques, and explain all relevant aspects of project finance so that public policy makers, developers, bankers, contractors, and other decision makers will {{be in a position to}} holistically evaluate this financial instrument and accordingly proceed to its adoption for financing infrastructure projects. by Theodoros Patramanis.
