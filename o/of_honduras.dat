5|$|A {{few days}} after this first encounter, on 14 August 1502, Columbus arrived on the {{mainland}} <b>of</b> <b>Honduras.</b> He dropped anchor at a place he named as Punta Caxinas, afterwards generally known as the Cape <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> near the modern town of Trujillo. He claimed possession of the territory for the king of Spain, and the coastal inhabitants greeted him in a friendly manner. After this he sailed eastward along the coast, struggling against gales and storms for a month, until the coast turned southward along {{what is now the}} east coast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> and he entered calmer waters. The Spanish named this point Cabo Gracias a Dios, giving thanks for their liberation from the storms. Colombus sailed on southwards as far as Panama, before turning back into the Caribbean Sea to be wrecked off Jamaica, before being rescued and taken to Hispaniola, and from there returning to Spain.|$|E

5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone, the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the Swan Islands, {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Honduras.</b> Heavy rainfall occurred throughout Jamaica, causing street flooding and several mudslides, but little damage. No disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel. The storm brushed eastern Belize while located off the coast, producing 3.62inches (21.9mm) of rainfall and light winds.|$|E
5|$|Cristóbal de la Cueva, {{under orders}} from Jorge de Alvarado in Guatemala, had entered Honduras with about forty men to {{establish}} a new port and road to Guatemala, and to put down a native uprising there. He was challenged by Andrés de Cerezeda, governor <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> and eventually marched south to San Miguel with his men, bringing an urgently needed influx of new colonists. San Miguel was refounded as San Miguel de la Frontera by Cristóbal de la Cueva on 15 April 1535. De la Cueva brought the area back within the jurisdiction of Guatemala, although the governor <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> vigorously protested. Eastern El Salvador, centred on the town of San Miguel, became the Province of San Miguel, which included the territory of the pre-Columbian province of Chaparrastique.|$|E

50|$|Less {{than half}} <b>of</b> <b>Honduras's</b> {{cultivable}} land was planted with crops {{as recently as}} the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much <b>of</b> <b>Honduras's</b> soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. In addition, by 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.|$|R

5|$|From November28 to November30, {{the storm}} brought light rains {{to most of}} eastern Cuba. Although the cyclone had {{tropical}} storm-force winds at the time, the highest recorded wind in Cuba was 12mph (18km/h) in Havana and only 0.22in (5.58mm) of rain fell in the city. The Swan Islands, off the northern coast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> recorded 2.36in (59.94mm) of precipitation during a three-day span.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm formed on June25, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the entire east coast of Quintana Roo on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly thereafter, the tropical storm warning was extended to include {{the east coast of}} Belize.

5|$|Olid treated González and Las Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> {{resulted in}} a significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and Las Casas set upon Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts <b>of</b> <b>Honduras.</b> A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the system {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved across the eastern Caribbean in the last week of May. The wave gradually organized itself as it entered the western Caribbean Sea on June 1.

5|$|When the Spanish {{first arrived}} {{in what is now}} Honduras, most of the {{estimated}} 800,000 population lived in the western and central regions. Honduras was a frontier region between Mesoamerica and the less complex societies to the south and southeast that were outside the direct Mesoamerican sphere of influence, although at times contact was direct and intense. Much <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> belonged to the so-called Intermediate Area, generally viewed as a region of lesser cultural development located between Mesoamerica and the Andean civilizations of South America. Cultural developments were closely related to those taking place in what is now El Salvador and Nicaragua, but also reflected cultural contacts with the Maya civilization and other Mesoamerican cultures such as those of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the central highlands of Mexico. The Pech people (formerly known as the Paya) occupied territory in the northeast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> possibly since antiquity. A similar scenario is proposed for those groups speaking Misumalpan languages, such as the Miskito and Sumu peoples. The Sumu, Pech and Miskito had cultural affinities to the south and east. The Lenca people occupied territories in central and southwestern Honduras, although linguistically related groups further southeast, they had strong cultural links to Mesoamerica. The Jicaque people also occupied lands in the region, in an area along the Atlantic coast from the Ulúa River east to an area between the Leán and Cuero rivers, and extending to the Nombre de Dios mountains. The Chorotega and the Pipil were both peoples belonging to the Mesoamerican cultural zone and fully partaking in it; the Pipil were found along the northern limits <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> while the Chorotega occupied territory in the south, around the Gulf of Fonseca. Lenca and Nahuas inhabited the islands of the Gulf. Early colonial documents suggest that the important settlements of Naco and Quimistan, in the northwest, were multiethnic, inhabited by Pipil and Lenca or Maya, or all three. Naco in particular was a large town and an important centre for commerce that became an early focus for Spanish expeditions. Those groups in the northeast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> were relatively isolated culturally, and not fully integrated into the exchange networks of either Mesoamerica or the Intermediate Area. The western fringe <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> was occupied by Maya peoples, the Ch'ol and the Ch'orti'. The Ch'ol occupied the region around the Amatique Bay and along the lower Chamelecón River. The Ch'orti' inhabited {{the upper reaches of the}} Chamelecón River and the Sensenti Valley.|$|E

5|$|While Marco {{was still}} {{spinning}} {{in the western}} Caribbean, the Government <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> allotted 70million HNL ($5.6million 1996USD) in emergency assistance. Following the storm, several countries contributed cash toward the recovery <b>of</b> <b>Honduras,</b> including: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $438,000. In addition, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant, worth $10,000. Japan donated 40tents, 10water purifiers, 480soaps, and 3emergency health kits in lieu of money. Norway donated almost $71,000 worth of food, medicines, and clothing. Spain also contributed medicine and transportation, costing $156,250. The United States donated plastic sheeting, water containers, and family food bags. The primary contributor of non-government aid was the Red Cross. After the storm, the Red Cross set up temporary shelters in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cortés, and El Progreso. Additionally, they distributed 3,000pounds of milk, clothing, 500sheets, chlorine boxes, 14,000pounds of rice, 15,000pounds of beans and 9,000pounds of maize, sugar, and butter.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late on October 12, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 13 off the north coast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras.</b> The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on October 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast <b>of</b> <b>Honduras</b> in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
