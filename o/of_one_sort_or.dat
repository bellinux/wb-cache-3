5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

60|$|We {{have to say}} of Friedrich's Associates, that {{generally}} they were of intelligent type, each of them master of something or other, and capable of rational discourse upon that at least. Integrity, loyalty of character, was indispensable; good humor, wit {{if it could be}} had, were much in request. There was no man of shining distinction there; but they were the best that could be had, and that is saying all. Friedrich cannot be said, either as Prince or as King, to have been superlatively successful in his choice <b>of</b> associates. With <b>one</b> single exception, to be noticed shortly, there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them whom we should now remember except for Friedrich's sake;--uniformly they are men whom it is now a weariness to hear of, except in a cursory manner. <b>One</b> man <b>of</b> shining parts he had, and one only; no man ever of really high and great mind. The latter sort are not so easy to get; rarely producible on the soil of this Earth! Nor is it certain how Friedrich might have managed with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> this <b>sort,</b> <b>or</b> he with Friedrich;--though Friedrich unquestionably would have tried, had the chance offered. For he loved intellect as few men on the throne, or off it, ever did; and the little he could gather of it round him often seems to me a fact tragical rather than otherwise.|$|R

25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, metal casting, drop forging, chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E
60|$|That {{all these}} governments of {{confusion}} will drift towards war, with a spacious impulse {{and a final}} vehemence quite out of comparison greater than the warlike impulses of former times, is a remarkable {{but by no means}} inexplicable thing. A tone of public expression, jealous and patriotic to the danger-point, is an unavoidable condition under which democratic governments exist. To be patriotically quarrelsome is imperative upon the party machines that will come to dominate the democratic countries. They will not possess detailed and definite policies and creeds because there are no longer any detailed and definite public opinions, but they will for all that require some ostensible purpose to explain their cohesion, some hold upon the common man that will ensure his appearance in numbers at the polling place sufficient to save the government from the raids of small but determined sects. That hold can be only <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort.</b> Without moral <b>or</b> religious uniformity, with material interests as involved and confused as a heap of spelicans, there remains only one generality for the politician's purpose, the ampler aspect of a man's egotism, his pride in what he imagines to be his particular kind--his patriotism. In every country amenable to democratic influences there emerges, or will emerge, a party machine, vividly and simply patriotic--and indefinite upon the score of any other possible consideration between man and man. This will hold true, not only of the ostensibly democratic states, but also of such reconstituted modern monarchies as Italy and Germany, for they, too, for all their legal difference, rest also on the grey. The party conflicts of the future will turn very largely on the discovery of the true patriot, on the suspicion that the crown or the machine in possession is in some more or less occult way traitorous, and almost all other matters of contention will be shelved and allowed to stagnate, for fear of breaking the unity of the national mechanism.|$|R

40|$|All cattle {{slaughtered}} {{at an age}} {{older than}} 24 months have to be tested mandatorily for BSE in Germany. Samples are taken from the brainstem. Given, that prions can occure in the body before being transfered to the brain, unrecognised infected cattle might represent a risk. To minimise that risk, Specified Risk Materials  which are defined by the regulation (EC) 999 / 2001  have to be removed after slaughtering. However, there is residual nervous tissue that is not governed by this regulation. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> those is the sympathetic trunk with its ganglia {{as a part of}} the autonomous nervous system. To estimate the risk from these ganglia, their way during slaughter and cutting procedures was observed. Thirty seven cutting plants in Northern Germany were visited and data from 160 workers were taken. Cutting plants were characterised with regard to their capacity: small (cutting capacity under 10 tons per week), middle size (cutting capacity between 10 and 99 tons per week) and large plants (cuttig capacity 100 and more tons per week). For reasons of reproducibility, the trunk was separated into five parts during observation (T 1, T 2 -T 6, T 7 -T 13, L 1 -L 6, S 1 -S 5). During cutting, ganglia containing tissues could be sorted into eight different boxes (meat for processing, other meat for consumption, fat for consumption, fat for other use, bones-industry, bones-consumption, bones-SRM, bones-disposal). Every worker was observed three times, the results were recorded in an observation sheet. The tissues were not sorted in the same way. Whereas the rear thoracic ganglia (T 7 -T 13) and sacral ganglia (S 1 -S 5) mostly remained in natural connection with the column bones and were littered as SRM, the ganglion stellatum (T 1), the front thoracic ganglia (T 2 -T 6) and also the lumbal ganglia (L 1 -L 6) went into the food chain in different percentages. There was an obvious difference between cutting plants of different capacities. In addition, there was a difference between workers from the same plant in more than half of all visited plants. Either the workers <b>of</b> <b>one</b> plant <b>sorted</b> differently, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> worker acted differently during the observation period. Such differences were observed more frequently in large cutting plants than in smaller ones. To minimize the differences as much as possible, standardisation is needed. Due to the fact that the majority of beef would be produced in large plants, standard operation prescriptions should be introduced in particular in these large premises. Because of its size and after observation of the cutting procedure, in particular the stellate ganglia (T 1) should be put on the list of SRM. For the other thoracic ganglia (T 2 -T 13) and the sacral ganglia (S 1 -S 5) standard operation prescriptions for the removal of the musculature that is associated with the spine and the removal of the transverse processes of the vertebraes are needed. The lumbal ganglia (L 1 -L 6) are hidden between the connective and fat tissues of the filet chain. They could not be taken away in practise. The risk coming from these ganglia should be tolerated...|$|R
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another, the Menasco engines being {{the primary source of}} those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; {{in the words of}} Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness".

Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E
