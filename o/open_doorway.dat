5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} panel, Mary {{is shown in}} a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand {{on either side of}} her. Both are dressed in black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through the <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E
500|$|Most unusually, [...] "Family" [...] did {{not have}} any scenes set on the bridge of the Enterprise. [...] It is {{sometimes}} incorrectly stated that [...] "Family" [...] was actually the first episode in the franchise that did not use the relevant standing bridge set (e.g., [...] ). [...] In fact that distinction belongs to , the penultimate episode of , which has no scenes set on the Enterprise at all: it is entirely planet-bound, except for one exterior space shot at the very end. [...] Furthermore, part of the bridge set is actually visible in [...] "Family", through a briefly <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arthur listened. He {{could not}} help it. He heard the girl's clear, {{distinct}} voice; the <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> conveyed every word to him.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{constructed}} {{to blend in}} with the surrounding hills and trees. The interior of the school was designed as an open structure, with movable walls and <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tom glanced {{through the}} {{slightly}} <b>opened</b> <b>doorway,</b> as he tightened his belt, and saw Betty {{and a boy}} of about fourteen years of age standing at a table, busily engaged loading several old-fashioned horse-pistols with buckshot.|$|R
500|$|The {{absence of}} mortar allows some {{ventilation}} in the innermost {{parts of the}} temple through the porous masonry used in the walls and ceilings. The modest amount of light entering the temples comes into the open halls from all directions, while the very subdued illumination in the inner closed mantapa comes only through its <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b> The vestibule receives even less light, making it necessary to {{have some form of}} artificial lighting (usually, oil lamps) even during the day. This artificial source of light perhaps adds [...] "mystery" [...] to the image of the deity worshipped in the sanctum.|$|E
500|$|To {{the rear}} and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez(8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, {{and head of the}} royal {{tapestry}} works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is [...] "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> reveal space behind: {{in the words of the}} art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure [...] "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is [...] "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".|$|E
2500|$|Only a {{small number}} of people were at the {{airstrip}} and saw the crash. [...] The airport groundsman and an airline staff member grabbed portable fire extinguishers, jumped into a car and raced across the airstrip. Others at the airstrip and nearby beaches ran towards the burning aircraft. [...] The aircraft's cabin door had been torn away by a tree stump and lay about [...] behind the aircraft but despite the <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> no-one inside the passenger cabin attempted to escape. [...] Fuel floating {{on the surface of the}} water was burning fiercely, making it dangerous to approach the wreckage. One of the first witnesses to reach the scene believed he saw two people at the front of the passenger cabin who were alive but before he could get close enough to investigate he was driven back by flames.|$|E
50|$|The Z-120 was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} German 120 kg class rules, hence its designation. It features a cantilever high-wing, a single-seat, an enclosed cabin accessed by <b>open</b> <b>doorways,</b> fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Pete Lownie's gone," [...] said Jess, whom I {{could not}} see from ben the house. I had a good glimpse of Tibbie, however, through the <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b> She had the {{armchair}} on the south side, as she would have said, of the fireplace.|$|R
25|$|The Multix has two variants, the AX+ and the MX. With the {{exception}} of doors (and the overall weight of the vehicle), both the variants are identical. AX+ has <b>open</b> <b>doorways,</b> whilst MX has doors. The curb weight of the MX is 100kg more than that of AX+.|$|R
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} most RPO cars was a hook {{that could be}} used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. [...] The first US patent for such a device (...) was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. With the train often operating at 70mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. [...] In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. [...] An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouch and deliver it to the post office.|$|E

They move just {{out of the way of}} the exit, [...] looking at CHLOE, who sways and very nearly falls.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{level of}} Space Dungeon {{consists}} of 36 rooms {{arranged in a}} six-by-six grid. Rooms are connected by <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> of various sizes. One room in each level is the entrance, where the player begins, and another is the [...] "Collect Bonus" [...] room. Other rooms {{may or may not}} contain laser defenses, hostile aliens, or various bits of treasure.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{group of}} men {{examining}} plans outside an adobe house in Ocean Park, ca. 1950. Five men in suits are looking at a large piece of paper at center. A damaged adobe wall can be seen behind the men. Some of the light-colored plaster is missing from the wall, and two <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> are visible, one at left and one at right...|$|R
60|$|There was a wistful sound, as {{of breath}} {{escaping}} hurriedly. Mr. Stone {{was standing in}} the <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ditmar sat idle {{for some}} minutes {{after she had}} gone, staring through the <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> into the outer office....|$|E
60|$|Walking {{slowly and}} on tiptoe, I picked {{my way through}} the {{weed-grown}} garden, and peered through the <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hope surged high in {{the breast}} of Gahan of Gathol, of Turan the panthan. Furtively his eyes sought the <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b> There {{was no one in}} sight. Ah, if he could but gain his freedom! He would find some way from this odious city back to her side and never again would he leave her until he had won safety for her or death for himself.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of workers}} loading steel onto a tractor in Los Angeles harbor, [s. d. ]. A large, dark-hulled ship {{can be seen}} docked at right. Cranes on the ship are loading several large steel beams onto a tractor waiting on the dock at center. Several workers can be seen {{standing}} on or around the tractor. At left, a large warehouse with several <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> is visible. Railroad tracks are embedded in the dock at center...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{original}} doors, {{many of which were}} French doors, have been removed with their hinges leaving <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b> The original interior doors are of panelled timber with pressed metal push plates. Evidence of {{the original}} dark stained finish is evident under layers of paint. The bay windows are substantially intact despite having been relocated from the corner of both front rooms. A decorative internal timber fretwork grille is fitted to both of them.|$|R
60|$|Then, as the cab stopped, and the <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> of the {{staircase}} was before her, all her courage came back.|$|E

5000|$|Cathedral of Santa Maria (Old Cathedral), a 14th-century Gothic {{building}} with a 17th-century tower. Under the pórtico are three <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> decorated with statues and reliefs. In the interior, chapels containing Gothic, Flemish and Italian Renaissance images including paintings by Rubens and van Dyck. The cathedral is undergoing restoration and has been studied by {{experts from around the}} world for its architectural curiosities, including those deformations which it has suffered due to previous restorations.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of {{the collective}} Hopi pueblo of Walpai, [s. d. ]. The adobe pueblo is a multi-layered building made up of many small rectangular sections. There are small square windows and <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> cut into many of these sections, and the different layers are connected by ladders or stairs. The pueblo is built on a rocky cliff, {{and some of the}} large rocks are visible at left. Picture file card reads "J. Smeding"...|$|R

50|$|The 'Give Love' album <b>opened</b> <b>doorways</b> for {{the group}} to travel to Spain for their first {{international}} tour in May 2006. This tour was dubbed the 'Word Of Mouth' tour simply because the band was an unknown quantity in Europe at the time. The band was received with excellent reviews and attendance at all of its shows. After returning to the United States the group began recording their second album of live material simply entitled 'Live'. The 'Live' album was released on October 7, 2006.|$|R
60|$|A {{young man}} {{came out of}} the Victoria station, looking undecidedly at the taxi-cabs, dark-red and black, {{pressing}} against the kerb under the glass-roof. Several men in greatcoats and brass buttons jerked themselves erect to catch his attention, at the same time {{keeping an eye on the}} other people as they filtered through the <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> of the station. Berry, however, was occupied by one of the men, a big, burly fellow whose blue eyes glared back and whose red-brown moustache bristled in defiance.|$|R
60|$|Rateau {{was walking}} rapidly, taking big strides {{with his long}} legs. Tournefort, now sauntering in the gutter {{in the middle of}} the road, now darting in and out of <b>open</b> <b>doorways,</b> kept his quarry well in sight. Chauvelin and Gourdon lagged some little way behind. It was still raining, but not heavily--a thin drizzle, which {{penetrated}} almost to the marrow. Not many passers-by haunted this forlorn quarter of old Paris. To right and left tall houses almost obscured the last, quickly-fading light of the grey September day.|$|R
