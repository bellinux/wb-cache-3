50|$|Albert Jarman Caley {{had begun}} selling {{a range of}} mineral waters and soft drinks in Norwich in 1863. He diversified to produce cocoa (1883), {{chocolate}} (1886) and Christmas crackers (1898). The business was purchased in 1918 by the African and Eastern Trading Company and underwent expansion at Norwich and mineral water and cider factories in London, Ipswich, and Banham. Caley's had become <b>overcapitalised</b> and unprofitable, and the new owner sought unsuccessfully {{to dispose of the}} business in the 1920s.|$|E
40|$|Fisheries in the European Union (EU) {{continue}} to be overexploited by an <b>overcapitalised</b> fishing fleet, despite the best intentions of two decades of capacity adjustment programmes. This paper considers the progress of fishing capacity under the Multi-annual Guidance Programme and examines the impact of subsidies {{made available to the}} fishing industry. The underlying reasons for the modest impact on improved resource sustainability are considered, despite capacity reductions in nominal terms. These include the impact of subsidies on capacity development and issues surrounding the use of vessel decommissioning. The Danish fishing fleet case serves as an empirical example in this regard. Comments on the future capacity management regime and the role of subsidies in EU fisheries are offered.

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1892, the Australian Joint Stock Bank {{had become}} the largest bank in Queensland having 19 branches. It was the biggest gold buyer on the Charters Towers field and carried many accounts, but it began <b>overcapitalising.</b> In April 1893, the AJS Bank closed during the {{national}} banking crisis which saw 8 banks shut their doors. After restructuring, the bank opened for business again on 16 June 1893 as the Australian Joint Stock Bank Limited. Charters Towers continued to prosper with gold production on the field peaking in 1899 at 319,572 ounces. The population also peaked in this year at around 26,500. Charters Towers was then {{the second most important}} city in Queensland and an internationally noted goldfield.|$|R
60|$|The late J. P. van Huytens he {{regarded}} with moral scorn. This rival millionaire {{had made his}} wealth by the process (apparently peaceful and horticultural) of 'watering stocks,' and by the seemingly misplaced generosity of <b>overcapitalising</b> enterprises, and 'grabbing side shows.' The nature {{of these and other}} financial misdemeanours Merton did not understand. But he learned from Mr. Macrae that thereby J. P. van Huytens had scooped in the widow, the orphan, the clergyman, and the colonel. The two men had met in the most exclusive circles of American society; with the young van Huytenses the daughter of the millionaire had even been on friendly terms, but Mr. Macrae retired to Europe, and put a stop to all that. To do so, indeed, was one of his motives for returning to the home of his ancestors, the remote and inaccessible Castle Skrae. The Sportsman's Guide to Scotland says, as to Loch Skrae: 'Railway to Lairg, then walk or hire forty-five miles.' The young van Huytenses were not invited to walk or hire.|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{economics}} {{draws upon}} fieldwork, experiments {{and research in}} disciplines such as psychology for building blocks to construct economic analysis that is more descriptively realistic and both augments and qualifies traditional economics {{as a tool for}} designing policy. Though behavioural economics has attracted much attention and respectability in the past decade or so, its roots date back to work undertaken in Europe a century ago and in the US {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century. Whereas economists traditionally have seen choice as an optimising activity subject to given preferences and a well-defined budget constraint, behavioural economics sees everyday life as a process in which humans with limited cognitive capacity try to cope with both information overload and the absence of relevant information and knowledge by evolving targets for what seems feasible and systems of rules for trying to find ways of meeting these targets. Some decision rules may be fast and frugal means of arriving at choices that do not result in needlessly poor attainments. However, much of what is known about how people actually behave implies that many people could be doing a lot better for themselves in many situations if only they were aware of the limitations of their ways of coping with the world and were motivated to find and apply improved decision rules. Poor search strategies limit the competitive pressures faced by firms and hence may have longer-term impacts on welfare via reduced productivity growth or innovation. However, in designing policies to promote better search by consumers one must remember that many consumers are also workers: higher productivity and better or cheaper goods may sometimes come at the cost of people having to work harder. To the extent that firms are aware of shortcomings of consumers 2 ̆ 7 decision-making processes, they may be in a position to apply this knowledge to manipulate choices, for example by how they frame information that is presented to consumers. Tendencies for consumers to lack self-control and to fail to reflect on the longer-term implications of their choices can very easily result in poor choices when credit is easily available. Regulatory policies could do more to promote careful reflection by consumer by erecting hurdles to delay choice, as well as by measures to make it easier for consumers to make comparisons and see the financial implications of particular choices. In designing such policies there is scope for integrating them with policies aimed at the promotion of self-funded retirement and environmental wellbeing. The paper ends with detailed case study discussions of problems of choice in the markets for building renovation services and financial services. In the former, problems of finding good value for money are increased by the one-off nature of much of the work and by combination of shortages of trades-people relative to demand and large numbers of potential suppliers to approach for quotations. The environment is also conducive to consumers ending up <b>overcapitalising</b> in their renovations. In the market for financial services, the balance of risk-taking with property speculation and suchlike is stacked in favour of the loan providers, whilst the chances of inexperienced speculators getting into difficulties are enhanced because they are prone to use decision rules they have picked up from others belatedly and in simplified form. The implications of borrowing and superannuation choices should be made much more transparent to consumers, along with the futility of trying to beat the market rather than investing in market index funds...|$|R
40|$|Typified by the South African sugar industry, current {{sugarcane}} {{transport and}} indeed also loading and supply {{systems have been}} identified as very inefficient and costly components of the sugar logistics chain. These systems have become significantly <b>overcapitalised,</b> fragmented and relatively poorly managed and coordinated, which has resulted in significant under utilisation of equipment for growers, transporters and the miller. This has contributed to role-player antagonism, distrust and unnecessarily high costs for all three role-players. It was proposed that at a mill a single control centre should schedule all the vehicles and also coordinate supply and loading operations to improve efficiency and reduce inbound supply chain costs. As a component of the SLIP programme, FREDD, a vehicle dispatching/ scheduling programme developed in New South Wales, Australia, has been introduced into four Mills in SA and Swaziland, which has resulted in significant improvements in efficiency. This paper will discuss the above mentioned projects ’ objectives to (1) customise FREDD for South African mills, (2) reduce vehicle delays by as much as 67 %, thereby reducing the number of vehicles in the fleet and maximising vehicle utilisation, (3) reduce the occurrenc...|$|E
40|$|For many Member States {{financial}} instruments (FI) were {{a new approach}} to delivering Cohesion policy. Their increased use in 2007 - 13 created significant challenges especially for Managing Authorities with limited experience. The regulatory framework provided flexibility to accommodate domestic arrangements, but demanded considerable administrative capacity. FIs can be more sustainable than grants, generate better quality projects, and may be considered more cost-effective in some circumstances. However, their main rationale in the OPs has been to facilitate access to finance for SMEs, which became more important in the crisis. The scale of FI varies between countries, as does the share reaching final recipients. In most countries, FI are over 80 % invested, but some very large FIs have been <b>overcapitalised</b> and the EU average is 61 %. Governance arrangements tend to be context specific, but build heavily on existing public financial institutions. Implementing FI proved complex with demands for greater clarity and certainty met through successive changes to the Regulations and guidance, many of which have been consolidated into the 2014 - 20 regulatory framework. Monitoring systems for FI are weak, with little hard data on outcomes such as private funding, job creation and innovation, but some evidence that FI increase access to finance and can help develop private markets...|$|E
40|$|While {{agricultural}} producers on commercially operated irrigation schemes will aim {{to achieve the}} recommended high crop yields, those on a smallholder irrigation scheme usually produce moderate to low crop yields. The water demand by these two irrigator types also differs and {{is reflected in the}} variations in crop yields. Because smallholder irrigators produce lower crop yields and use less water, they should use a system suited to this lower water demand. Many irrigation schemes have the opportunity for participants to assess their farming objectives and models. The irrigators can then use the assessment results to determine their water demands, reduce their infrastructure capacity and reduce their capital, operation and maintenance costs. On many smallholder schemes, the system has been designed for commercial crop yields and water use. If smallholders never achieve commercial levels of production, they have <b>overcapitalised</b> and subjected themselves to additional operational strain. In this study, six irrigation schemes based in the Eastern Cape were evaluated according to three levels of irrigation supply: a commercial irrigator, a smallholder irrigator and the commercial under-utilised irrigator. The irrigation infrastructure for each of the six schemes was designed, and the associated costs determined, for each level of supply. The study investigates the impact of different designs on the amount of water and land used, and resultant costs of the infrastructure. The results show that a smallholder irrigator using a scheme sized for commercial operation can have significantly higher (between 5 % and 29 %) annual operation and maintenance costs. The study clearly shows that the farmer type should be considered when designing each irrigation scheme...|$|E
