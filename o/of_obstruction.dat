5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> of justice for {{shredding}} the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number}} of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E

5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{of the passage}} of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E

25|$|Obstruction: When part of {{the airway}} (bronchus) leading to the alveoli is obstructed, the lung cannot {{eliminate}} fluid; {{this can lead to}} pneumonia. One cause <b>of</b> <b>obstruction,</b> especially in young children, is inhalation of a foreign object such as a marble or toy. The object lodges in a small airway, and pneumonia develops in the obstructed area of the lung. Another cause <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> is lung cancer, which can block the flow of air.|$|E

When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical (neck) region as the site of the obstruction.

40|$|Membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> the {{inferior}} vena cava {{is a rare}} disease. The etiology of the membrane {{is believed to be}} thrombotic or congenital.

There was also no evidence of inherited defects in the natural coagulation inhibitors (protein C, protein S and antithrombin III) and plasminogen deficiency, This familial occurrence <b>of</b> membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> the inferior vena cava supports a congenital etiology, although a thrombotic etiology cannot be totally excluded...|$|R
