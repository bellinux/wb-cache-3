The project allows the advertising team to create a display wherein the billboard content changes automatically and synchronically with changes in the display’s environment.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Out-of-Home</b> (OOH) <b>advertising</b> is {{currently}} advancing {{into a new}} era: “pervasive advertising ” {{is one of the}} buzz words describing a soft change from the traditional push-only media to an interactive and bi-directional advertisement experience. While ambient media solutions try to conquer each and every piece of potential advertisement surfaces by various sorts of print media, another trend can be observed as well: OOH advertising is becoming smarter (at least from an electronics point of view). Digital signage products, SMS, Bluetooth interaction in city lights and talking billboards that react on the feedback of motion sensors—pervasive advertising is on its way. However, the development of a pervasive advertisement platform {{is beyond the scope of}} any single engineering or art discipline; instead it is a multidisciplinary effort including electronic engineering, computer science, art, cognitive psychology and even social sciences. Therefore, we introduce a tokenized interaction architecture; a foundation on top of low level issues that simplifies sub sequent implementation efforts by addressing interaction, context awareness and hardware heterogeneity, so to release designers of pervasive advertising campaigns from computer related challenges. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Out-of-home</b> (OOH) <b>advertising</b> {{media have}} {{expanded}} worldwide {{and the shape}} and format of these media globally, {{as well as in}} South Africa, have changed considerably. Until recently, the OOH advertising media landscape consisted primarily of outdoor advertising or billboards reaching vehicular traffic, but now has expanded to include a wide range of OOH advertising media types which aim to reach a mobile audience wherever they live, work, play, drive, shop or commute. Currently there is no coherent contemporary framework to compare and select the most effective media options to reach a selected target market in a specific OOH audience environment. This article draws from academic and practitioner sources to propose a classification framework for OOH advertising media in South Africa comprising four major platforms: outdoor advertising, transit media advertising, street-and-retail furniture advertising, and digital and ambient OOH media channels. The framework serves to inform marketers of viable and cost-effective traditional and contemporary OOH advertising media options. It also indicates what platforms are appropriate to reach specific audiences effectively in a variety of environments outside their homes. This is the first framework of its kind for the South African context that offers an orderly, integrated basis for future research.

40|$|Pervasive {{user-centric}} {{applications are}} systems which {{are meant to}} sense the presence, mood, and intentions of users in order to optimize user comfort and performance or to assist people in their spe-cific activities. Building such applications requires not only state-of-the art techniques from artificial intelligence but also sound software engineering methods for facilitating modular design, runtime adaptation and verification of critical system requirements. In this paper we focus on high-level design and analysis, and use the algebraic rewriting language Real-Time Maude for specifying applications in a real-time setting. We propose a component-based approach for modeling pervasive user-centric systems in a generic way and show how to instantiate the generic rules for a simple <b>out-of-home</b> digital <b>advertising</b> application and how to analyze and prove crucial properties of the system architecture through model checking and simulation. For proving time-dependent properties of systems we use Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) and present analysis algorithms for model checking two subclasses of MTL formulas: time-bounded response and time-bounded safety MTL formulas. The underlying idea is to extend the Real-Time Maude model with suitable clocks and to transform the MTL formulas into LTL formulas over the extended specification. This {{makes it possible to}} use the LTL model checker of Maude for verifying rea...|$|R
