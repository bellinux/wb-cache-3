When corrected for microbial contamination, estimates of RU and intestinal digestibility decreased in all tested fractions for both feeds. All RU estimates increased with the protective treatments, whereas intestinal digestibility-dry matter also increased in SFM. Low intestinal digestibility-crude protein values suggested {{the presence of}} antitrypsin factors in SP. Protective treatments of both feeds led to consistent increases in the intestinal digested fraction of dry matter and crude protein, being only numerically different for SP-starch (60. 5 % as average).

40|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{a number}} of important tubular products stringent requirements have been imposed on quality of their inner surfaces. The well-known methods for inner surface treatment of pipes include sandblasting, chemical cleaning with acid reagents (oxalic, formic, sulfamic, <b>orthophosphoric</b> <b>acids)</b> and electrochemical polishing. Disadvantages of the chemical method are cleaning-up irregularities, high metal removal, limited number of reagent application, complicated selection of reagent chemical composition and concentration, complicated and environmentally harmful recycling of waste chemicals, high cost of reagents. Low productivity at a high cost, as well as hazardous impact on personnel due to high dispersion of abrasive dust are considered as disadvantages of sandblasting. Electrochemical polishing is characterized by the following disadvantages: low processing productivity because supply of high currents is rather difficult due to electrolyte scattering capacity away from the main electrode action zone, limited length of the cavity to be treated due to heating of flexible current leads at operating current densities, application of expensive aggressive electrolytes and high costs of their recycling. A new method for polishing and cleaning of inner surfaces of tubular products based on electrolyte-plasma treatment has been developed. In comparison with the existing methods the proposed methods ensures quality processing with high intensity while applying non-toxic, environmentally friendly and cheap electrolytes. The paper presents results of investigations on technological specific features of electrolyte-plasma treatment for inner surfaces of tubular products: influence of slotted nozzle width, electrolyte flow and rate on stability of gas-vapor blanket, current density and productivity. Results of the research have made it possible to determine modes that provide stability and high productivity in the process of electrolyte-plasma treatment of inner surfaces of tubular products. </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently, many {{polymeric}} biomaterials do {{not possess}} the most desirable surface properties for direct bone bonding {{due to the lack}} of suitable surface functionalities. The incorporation of negatively charged groups has been shown to enhance calcium phosphate formation in vitro and bone bonding ability in vivo. However, there are some conflicting literature reports that highlight the complicated nature of the mineralisation process as well as the sometimes apparent contradictory effect of the negatively charged groups. Surface modification using well-defined polymers offer a more precise control of the chain structures. The aims of this study were to synthesise well-defined polymers containing phosphate and carboxylic acid groups, and perform various surface modification techniques. The influence of the polymer structure on mineralisation was examined using a series of specially synthesised phosphate-containing polymers. The mineralisation ability of the fabricated surfaces was also tested. Soluble poly(monoacryloxyethyl phosphate) (PMAEP) and poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphate) (PMOEP) were synthesised using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) -mediated polymerisation. The polymerisation conversions were monitored by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Subsequently 31 P NMR investigation revealed the presence of large amounts of diene impurities as well as free <b>orthophosphoric</b> <b>acids</b> in both the MAEP and MOEP monomers. Elemental analyses of the polymers showed loss of phosphate groups due to hydrolysis during the polymerisation. Both gel and soluble PMAEP polymers were found to contain large amounts of carboxyl groups indicating hydrolysis at the C-O-C ester linkages. Block copolymers consisting of PMAEP or PMOEP and poly(2 -(acetoacetoxy) ethyl methacrylate) PAAEMA were successfully prepared for the purpose of immobilisation of these polymers onto aminated slides. Well-defined fluorinated polymers, (poly(pentafluorostyrene) (PFS), poly(tetrafluoropropyl acrylate) (TFPA) and poly(tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (TFPMA)) were synthesised by RAFT-mediated polymerisation. It was found that the Mn values of PFS at higher conversions were significantly lower than those calculated from the theory, although the PDI's were low (< 1. 1). One possible explanation for this is that it may be a result of the self-initiation of FS which created more chains than the added RAFT agents. Both TFPA and TFPMA showed well-controlled RAFT polymerisations. Chain extension of the fluorinated polymers with tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) followed by hydrolysis of the tBA groups produced the amphiphilic block copolymers containing carboxylic acid groups. Block copolymers consisting of PAAEMA segments were further reacted with glycine and L-phenylalanyl glycine. Three types of surface modifications were carried out: Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assemblies of the soluble phosphate- and carboxylic acid-containing homopolymers, coupling reactions of block copolymers consisting of phosphate and keto groups onto aminated slides, and adsorption of fluorinated homo and block copolymers containing carboxylic acid groups onto PTFE. For LbL assemblies XPS analyses revealed that the thickness of the poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) layer was found to be strongly dependent on the pH at deposition. AFM images showed that the PMAEP LbL had a patchy morphology which was due to the carboxylate groups that were not deprotonated at low pH. Successful coupling of the block copolymers consisting of phosphate and keto groups onto aminated slides was evident in the XPS results. The conformation of attached P(MOEP-b-AAEMA) was investigated by ToF-SIMS. Adsorption of the fluorinated polymers onto the PTFE film was examined using different solvents. PFS showed the best adsorption onto PTFE. The block copolymers consisting of PFS and PtBA or PAA were successfully adsorbed onto PTFE. Contact angle measurements showed that the adsorbed block copolymers reorganised quickly to form a hydrophilic surface during the investigation. In vitro mineralisation of various phosphate-containing polymers and the fabricated surfaces were studied using the simulated body fluid (SBF) technique. The SEM/EDX investigation showed that either brushite or monetite, with a tile-like morphology, was formed on both soluble and gel PMAEP polymers after seven days in SBF. The PMOEP gel formed a similar layer as well as a secondary growth of hydroxyapatite (HAP) that exhibited a typical globular morphology. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the PMOEP film prepared from soluble PMOEP showed large amounts of carbonated HAP formation after seven days in SBF. Carbonated HAP is the phase that most closely resembles that found in biological systems. Both the LbL surfaces and the block copolymer-attached aminated slides showed only patchy mineralisation even after 14 days in SBF. This indicates that ionic interactions of the negatively charged phosphates or carboxylates and protonated amines prevented chelation of calcium ions, which is believed to be the first step in mineralisation. The P(FS-b-AA) adsorbed PTFE film also showed only small amounts of mineral formation after 14 days in SBF. These results highlight the many features controlling the mineralisation outcomes...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of thermal NIL {{presented}} here, holes are pre-patterned in a triangular array {{on the surface of}} a thin aluminium layer deposited on a P+ conductive Si wafer. As described in Figure  1 c, a thermoplastic resin (NEB 22 from Sumitomo Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) is coated on an aluminium layer. A silicon mould, treated with an anti-sticking layer [31] and presenting a triangular array of pits, is then pressed on the sample in an EVG 520 hot embossing tool (EV Group, St. Florian an Inn, Austria) at 0.2 kN.cm− 2 and 125 °C. Mould patterns are reproduced in the polymer since the applied temperature is higher than the resin's glass transition temperature. After removal from the mould at room temperature, the pattern is transferred into the surface of the Al layer using a conventional plasma dry etching technique. In a Centura 5200 reactive ion etching chamber (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a Cl 2 /Ar/O 2 plasma is used to remove the residual resin layer and a Cl 2 /BCl 3 plasma is used for etching the Al surface. The final structure consists of a 2 × 2 -cm 2 surface of aluminium structured with holes of few nanometres depth in a triangular array of different periods according to the initial mould design. During the anodization, these holes will act as surface defects, initiating the pore growth as described in Figure  1 a. The layer is so directly anodized at the voltage corresponding to the period given by the NIL and according to Equation 1. Samples are anodized in a home-made cell under a constant voltage, in an <b>orthophosphoric</b> or oxalic <b>acid</b> bath at constant temperature (T = 8 °C). The electrolyte is stirred during the process of anodization to facilitate the flow of the species in the electrolyte and to remove the bubbles of H 2 gas from the platinum electrode. A Parstat 2273 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) is used to apply a constant voltage and to follow the I-V curve in situ between a platinum circular electrode and the sample. In order to obtain defect-free triangular arrays of pores, the voltage has to be adjusted so that the natural period of the porous alumina corresponds to the NIL-fabricated guiding pattern. The anodizing time does not differ significantly from the classical anodization time of a simple anodization: with 3 % oxalic acid under 40 V at 8 °C, simple anodization of 1 μm of Al takes 1, 750 s and anodization after nanoimprint lasts 1, 700 s. Furthermore, under these experimental conditions, the ratio between the thickness of Al layer deposited and the final thickness of highly organised alumina is evaluated at 1.25. Figure  1 b shows an array of 2 × 2 cm 2 of highly organised porous alumina.|$|R
