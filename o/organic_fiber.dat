40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates {{personal}} {{exposure to}} respirable inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>fibers</b> during normal human lifetimes and assesses {{the order of}} magnitude of the contribution of inorganic fibers other than asbestos to total fiber exposure from man-made and natural sources. METHODS: Four groups (suburban schoolchildren, rural retired persons, office workers, and taxi drivers), with five persons per group, were monitored for 24 h four times during one year. Personal sampling pumps collected airborne dust on gold-precoated Nuclepore filters. The fibers were analyzed for fiber sizes specified by the World Health Organization. RESULTS: The geometric mean concentrations ranged from 9000 fibers. m- 3 (office workers) to 20000 fibers. m- 3 (schoolchildren) for <b>organic</b> <b>fibers,</b> and from 600 fibers. m- 3 (taxi drivers) to 4000 fibers. m- 3 (schoolchildren) for gypsum fibers. For other inorganic fibers the concentrations were around 5000 fibers. m- 3. The contribution of fibers with an elemental composition {{similar to that of}} man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF) was less than about one-quarter of the content of other inorganic fibers. The fiber size distributions were uniform across the groups, and the <b>organic</b> <b>fibers</b> were the longest and thinnest nonasbestos fibers. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime exposure to fibers can be ranked as <b>organic</b> <b>fibers</b> > other inorganic fibers > fibers with an elemental composition similar to MMVF > MMVF. Information on the biological effects of fibers is difficult to interpret for use in assessing the health risk from exposure to low levels of ubiquitous fibers, and {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the effects of <b>organic</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Man-made organic fibers (MMOFs) {{have been}} {{manufactured}} for over 50 years. Until recently, {{there have been}} few concerns raised regarding the safety of <b>organic</b> <b>fiber</b> dusts. This is due, in large part, to the perception that the dimensions of most, if not all, of these products were too large to be inhaled into the distal lungs of workers, i. e., were considered to be nonrespirable. A brief review of some of the issues related to <b>organic</b> <b>fiber</b> toxicology is presented herein. Some of the organic fiber-types used in commerce are identified and some fundamental tenets of fiber toxicology are discussed. In addition, the European Union, in their recent consideration for banning chrysotile asbestos fibers, evaluated some <b>organic</b> <b>fiber</b> substitutes and compared them to the hazards of asbestos. A brief review of their conclusions is described below. Finally, the results of some recent studies assessing the mechanisms of biodegradability of para-aramid respirable-sized, fiber-shaped particulates (RFP) are presented. Para-aramid (p-aramid) RFP are the most extensively-studied respirable organic fiber-type and RFP is the new term which describes respirable-sized organic fibers (ECETOC, 1996) (1). The results of these studies provide clues regarding the mechanism(s) of p-aramid RFP shortening in the lungs of exposed animals, and may be relevant for humans.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} thermal damage on the {{physical}} and mechanical properties of ultrahigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC), especially on their cracking process under compressive loading. Four mixtures of UHPFRC were prepared using identical composition but reinforced with different types of fibers: mineral fibers (Steel or Wollastonite) or <b>organic</b> <b>fibers</b> (PP or PVA) and compared with that without fibers (UHPC). To induce a thermal damage on UHPFRC, the samples were subjected to temperatures ranging from 150 to 400 °C. After each degradation stage, the gas permeability and the P-wave velocity were measured. The mechanical behavior under loading has been studied using a uniaxial compression test which combines the gas permeability and the acoustic emission measurement. The {{results show that the}} melting of <b>organic</b> <b>fibers</b> at approximately 180 °C builds a tunnel across the cement paste and increases brutally the gas permeability. At 400 °C treatment, a decrease of compression strength by 30 % and of Young modulus by approximately 60 % was observed. However, we can see that the thermal damage results a decrease in the threshold of initial cracking (rk-ci) and that of unstable cracking (rk-pi), and this {{can be explained by the}} initiation of new cracks and their coalescence...|$|R

Using our criteria (processibility, neat resin properties, and vessel performance), we find that an epoxy system based on the rubber-modified bis-phenol-F resin, diluted with vinyl cyclohexane dioxide and cured with mixed aromatic amines, can easily replace bis-phenol-A epoxies diluted with bis-(2, 3 -epoxycyclopentyl) ether (such as ERL 2256 epoxy of Union Carbide) with comparable overall performance...|$|E
