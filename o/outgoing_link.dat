40|$|Abstract—The {{lifetime}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) is optimized if the traffic within the network is adjusted {{in a way that}} all nodes dissipate their energies in a balanced fashion. To balance the energy dissipation, nodes split their flows and these flows are forwarded to different nodes acting as relays. In consequence some nodes have too many incoming and/or <b>outgoing</b> <b>links.</b> In this letter we investigate the impact of limiting the number of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> of nodes on the network {{lifetime of}} WSNs through a Mixed Binary Linear Programming (MBLP) framework.

50|$|The access logs of most {{web servers}} keep {{detailed}} information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site. They do not, however, log which links visitors left by. This is because the visitor's browser has no need {{to communicate with the}} original server when the visitor clicks on an <b>outgoing</b> <b>link.</b> This information can be captured in several ways. One way involves URL redirection. Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue. The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of community detection in directed networks by using probabilistic models. Most existing probabilistic models for community detection are either symmetric in which incoming <b>links</b> and <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> are treated equally or conditional in which only one type (i. e., either incoming or <b>outgoing)</b> of <b>links</b> is modeled. We present a probabilistic model for directed network community detection that aims to model both incoming <b>links</b> and <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> simultaneously and differentially. In particular, we introduce latent variables node productivity and node popularity to explicitly capture <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> and incoming links, respectively. We demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework by showing that both symmetric models and conditional models for community detection {{can be derived from}} the proposed framework as special cases, leading to better understanding of the existing models.

40|$|Abstract Most of routing {{protocols}} {{designed for the}} Internet today are for networks with bidirectional links. These protocols cannot be easily extended to networks with unidirectional links without increasing cost. In [1], Chen et al. presented a distance-vector-based routing protocol for unidirectional networks where a routing table is derived for each node in the network. In this paper, we extend the protocol in [1] by keeping one path for each <b>outgoing</b> <b>link</b> of a node to maintain multiple paths in the corresponding routing table. The path for a specific <b>outgoing</b> <b>link</b> is the shortest path from the node to the destination through that <b>outgoing</b> <b>link.</b> Thus, the protocol provides alternative paths that are vital in the dynamic network environment.

For best-effort services, we propose {{a new approach to}} achieving type-of-service (TOS) classes with adaptive nexthop routing. We consider two TOS classes, namely, delaysensitive and throughput-sensitive. As in routing protocols such as OSPF and integrated IS-IS, each node has a different next-hop for each destination and TOS class. Traditionally, a node has a single FCFS queue for each <b>outgoing</b> <b>link,</b> and the next-hops are computed using link measurements. In our approach, we attempt to isolate the two traffic classes by using for each <b>outgoing</b> <b>link</b> a separate FCFS queue for each TOS class; the link is shared cyclicly between its TOS queues. The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that traffic. The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to overall link utilizations.

The indexes describe bloggers’ community recommendations, centrality and bloggers’ attempt to form spheres of influence. Five Social Network Analysis indexes are used: incoming <b>links,</b> normalized betweenness, <b>outgoing</b> <b>links,</b> number of 1 -cliques a blog belongs to, {{and size of}} blog’s ego-network. By recording 127 Greek political blogs, the paper finds {{that there are two}} distinct blog performance properties regarding connectivity: Only a few blogs serve as authority blogs having many incoming links and centrality, while a few others try to expand their influence territory by having many <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> and forming larger 1 -cliques and ego-networks. Next, the paper associates the proposed indexes with blogs’ and users’ community activity. Authority blogs present high blog activity and users’ community activity, as well. These are recorded by large numbers of posts and comments to the blog posts, respectively. It is shown that blogs, which strive to expand their network by using many <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> are more likely to link to the authority blogs.

While the incoming link distribution follows a stretched exponential function, the lower bound for the <b>outgoing</b> <b>link</b> distribution has the same envelope of the scientific paper citation distribution proposed by Albuquerque and Tsallis.

A way to maintain crop {{diversity is}} to sustain seed exchange among farmers. Network simulations help in establishing which network properties promote crop diversity conservation.

The network model is based on published data on a directed network of barley seed flows in seven villages of Northern Ethiopia. Results show {{that the number of}} households that can be reached when introducing a new variety depends on the number of <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> of the household that first received the new variety. The distribution of the number of both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> shows a departure from a normal distribution. This trend is explained by the presence of a minority of highly connected households and of a majority of weakly connected households. For the whole network, there is no significant correlation between the number of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>links</b> of households. The findings explain the common observation that individual farmers do not cultivate all varieties present in a seed system. Absence of reciprocal exchange makes such networks less vulnerable to wholesale displacement of farmer varieties by improved ones...|$|R
