We have carried out an empirical study of the sensitivity of the methane to fluctuations in ozone column abundance. This analysis was carried out using monthly mean surface methane concentrations measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (NOAA-CMDL) Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network from 1983 to 1998 and ozone column abundances obtained by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the EP TOMS instruments over the same time period. We focused on interannual variability with periods between 15 and 60 months, in which interval the dominant <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuation</b> is the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), with a period of approximately 29 months. In order to isolate the response of methane to ozone from the effects of variability in the sources and transport of methane, we restricted our analysis to data at mid-latitudes in the southern hemisphere. A statistical study shows that the sensitivity factor α≡−d(ln[CH_ 4]) /d(ln[O_ 3]) =− 0. 038 ± 0. 009. The response of CH_ 4 lags approximately 6 months behind the forcing by O_ 3.

40|$|Interannual {{variations}} of total ozone in the equatorial region {{are discussed in}} terms of the lower-stratospheric dynamical processes associated with sea surface temperature (SST) changes on an El Nino-Southern Oscillation time scale. Tropospheric diabatic heating by the latent heat release in convective systems drives the interannual {{variations of}} tropopause height and atmospheric vertical motions. The adiabatic cooling associated with the dynamically forced ascending motion is subject to radiative heating, which further extends the upwelling motion into the stratosphere. SST variations can thus influence total ozone amounts by changing the tropopause height and vertical advection through modulation of tropospheric diabatic heating. Mechanistic relationships that describe total <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> through the advection effect and the tropopause effect of SST variations are derived using the equivalent potential temperature. Total <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are estimated using a quantitative formulation of these mechanistic equations together with the observed SST data. These results indicate that the interannual variations of the zonal wave component of equatorial total ozone are governed by the tropopause effect of SST variations.

The third panel shows the geopotential height (GPH) at 10 hPa (32 km) from June 2011 to May 2012 from ECMWF reanalysis data. The stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (σ _ strato) are larger when the GPHs are lower above our location. These lower GPHs are associated with deformations and southward excursions of the polar vortex, which are caused by planetary Rossby wave activity (Calisesi et al. 2001). The fourth panel of Fig. 5 shows the vertical wind from ECMWF reanalysis data. The strong vertical wind oscillations during December and January occur presumably because of the planetary Rossby wave breaking. In fact, Chandran et al.

The goal is to investigate whether natural short-term <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> can occur exceeding the 2 % standard deviation level. These disturbances are believed to occur naturally in the stratosphere primarily due to atmospheric waves propagating from the troposphere into the stratosphere during winter, since the winds are eastward at all altitudes levels and also due to the winter stratosphere which is more dynamically driven than radiatively driven (Zhu and Holton 1986; Appenzeller and Holton 1997; Eckermann et al. 1998; Calisesi et al. 2001; Fritts and Alexander 2003; Moustaoui et al. 2003; Hocke et al. 2006; Noguchi et al. 2006; Flury et al. 2009; Chane et al. 2016).|$|R

Although <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are anti-correlated with those in temperature, minima in ozone do not coincide exactly in longitude with temperature maxima.

Observed temperatures and meridional stream functions, calculated from data, were used as inputs for the model. Deviations of the model-calculated total ozone from the 4 -year mean were compared with the observed variations. It is shown that a substantial part of the observed variability of total ozone is reproduced by the model, despite uncertainties in the heating rates and without any special attempts to obtain consistent eddy diffusion or otherwise to tune the model. Results indicate that the temperature dependence of the ozone gas phase chemistry plays a negligible role in explaining the observed interannual variations in total ozone.

30|$|The {{short-term}} stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (σ _ strato) {{can also}} {{be affected by the}} tropospheric correction, since the retrieval error of the measurements is larger when the tropospheric correction is larger. This contribution can be estimated; therefore, we have calculated the influence of the tropospheric correction in the retrieved profiles. To bring about this requirement, we consider during the retrieval procedure that the brightness temperature error depends on the transmission factor (Eq. 3). In Fig. 4, we can observe the effect of the tropospheric transmittance in the random retrieval error of the profile, which is provided by the optimal estimation method (the smoothing error is not considered), at different pressure levels for the period from June 2011 to May 2012. The retrieval error is smaller when the tropospheric transmittance is larger. However, this effect is smaller than 0.02 ppm at 10 hPa.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of large ionospheric disturbances associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) has challenged the current understanding of mechanisms coupling the stratosphere and ionosphere. Non-linear interaction of planetary waves and tides has been invoked {{as a primary}} mechanism for such coupling. Here we show that planetary waves may play a more complex role than previously thought. Planetary wave forcing induces a global circulation {{that leads to the}} build-up of ozone density in the tropics at 30 – 50 km altitude, the primary region responsible for the generation of the migrating semidiurnal tide. The increase in the ozone density reaches 25 % and lasts for ∼ 35 days following the SSW, long {{after the collapse of the}} planetary waves. Ozone enhancements are not only associated with SSW but are also observed after other amplifications in planetary waves. In addition, the longitudinal distribution of the ozone becomes strongly asymmetric, potentially leading to the generation of non-migrating semidiurnal tides. We report a persistent increase in the variability of ionospheric total electron content that coincides with the increase in stratospheric ozone and we suggest that the <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> affect the ionosphere through the modified tidal forcing.

30|$|Many of the {{instruments}} used for measuring {{the composition of the}} atmosphere make use of the spectral properties of its constituent gases (Parrish 1994). Millimeter wave radiometry is a well-established tool for the monitoring of atmospheric species. It is a passive remote sensing technique which detects radiation emitted by rotational transitions of molecules in the atmosphere. The spectral analysis of the pressure broadened lines emitted by the species under analysis permits the retrieval of the vertical profile from the lower stratosphere to the mesosphere (20 – 70 km) (Kämpfer 1995). The technique enables day-round measurements as there is no reliance on the Sun as a source and under nearly all weather conditions. In addition, microwave radiometry provides high temporal resolution. In the present study, we take advantage of this feature and we analyse the short-term fluctuations (1 – 4 h) of stratospheric ozone measured by the GROMOS radiometer. The aim of this analysis is to initiate a new field of study regarding the short-term stratospheric perturbations in trace constituents, ozone in our case, since we are not aware of any other studies on this topic, except for Hocke et al. (2006), but this study is restricted to mesospheric fluctuations. The characterisation of the short-term <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the role of atmospheric waves and nonlinear wave-wave interactions to induce perturbations in trace gas profiles.|$|R
30|$|The {{shape of}} the {{spectral}} line measured by the instrument contains information on the vertical distribution of the emitting molecule, because of the pressure broadening (Parrish 1994). Therefore, the vertical distribution of ozone VMR can be retrieved from the observed emission line shape by means of radiative transfer in a model atmosphere and an optimal estimation method. The atmospheric radiative transfer simulator (ARTS 2) (Eriksson et al. 2011) is used as forward model to simulate atmospheric radiative transfer and calculate an ozone spectrum for the modelled atmosphere by using an a priori ozone profile. The inversion is done through the accompanying MATLAB package Qpack 2 (Eriksson et al. 2005), which uses the optimal estimation method (OEM) (Rodgers 1976) to derive the best estimate of the vertical profile by combining the measured and modelled spectra. During the inversion process, a priori information is required. The a priori ozone profiles are from a monthly climatology from reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) up to 70 km and extended above by a monthly ozone climatology from observations close to Bern of the satellite microwave limb sounder Aura/MLS. In the present study, we use the retrieval version 111 which is optimised for the retrieval of short-term <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> since we take into account uncertainties of the retrieved ozone resulting from the tropospheric opacity as described later in more detail. The a priori covariance matrix of retrieval version 111 is 2 ppm for the diagonal elements, and the values decay exponentially with a correlation length of 3 km for the off-diagonal elements.|$|R

Because smoke from large high-intensity fires are known to contain and generate secondary fine particles (PM 2. 5) and ozone precursors, the effect of fires on air quality in the southern Sierra Nevada is a serious management issue. Various process-based models {{have been developed for}} forecasting PM and ozone levels in the presence and absence of fires. Although these models provide deterministic predictions, few of them give measures of uncertainties associated with these predictions. Estimates of uncertainties are essential for model evaluation and forecasting with known precision levels. In this chapter we present a statistical procedure for forecasting next-day ozone levels at given sites. The statistical model takes into account some of the known sources of <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> including changes in temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and, during fire season, effects of smoke from fires. Other sources of variation not directly accounted for in the model—e. g., variability in daily amount of ozone produced by sources other than fire—are included in the uncertainty measure as random effect variables. The advantage of a model that is capable of estimating mean effects and uncertainties simultaneously is that evaluation of model performance is immediate and predictions are available with specific precision levels.

40|$|Detrended {{fluctuation}} {{analysis is}} applied to the time series of the global tropopause height derived from the 1980 – 2004 daily radiosonde data, in order to detect long-range correlations in its time evolution. Global tropopause height fluctuations in small time-intervals are found to be positively correlated to those in larger time intervals in a power-law fashion. The exponent of this dependence is larger in the tropics than in the middle and high latitudes in both hemispheres. Greater persistence is observed in the tropopause of the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere. A plausible physical explanation of the fact that long-range correlations in tropopause variability decreases with increasing latitude is that the column <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (that are closely related with the tropopause ones) exhibit long range correlations, which are larger in tropics than in the middle and high latitudes at long time scales. This finding for the tropopause height variability should reduce the existing uncertainties in assessing the climatic characteristics. More specifically the reliably modelled values of a climatic variable (i. e. past and future simulations) must exhibit the same scaling behaviour with that possibly existing in the real observations of the variable under consideration. An effort has been made to this end by applying the detrended fluctuation analysis to the global mean monthly land and sea surface temperature anomalies during the period January 1850 –August 2008.

40|$|Long-term {{variations}} in ozone {{have been caused}} by both natural and humankind related processes. The humankind or anthropogenic influence on ozone originates from the chlorofluorocarbons and halons (chlorine and bromine) and has led to international regulations greatly limiting the release of these substances. Certain natural ozone influences are also important in polar regions and are caused by the impact of solar charged particles on the atmosphere. Such natural variations have been studied in order to better quantify the human influence on polar ozone. Large-scale explosions on the Sun near solar maximum lead to emissions of charged particles (mainly protons and electrons), some of which enter the Earth's magnetosphere and rain down on the polar regions. "Solar proton events" have been used to describe these phenomena since the protons associated with these solar events sometimes create a significant atmospheric disturbance. We have used the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to study the long-term (> few months) influences of solar proton events from 1963 through 2004 on stratospheric ozone and temperature. There were extremely large solar proton events in 1972, 1989, 2000, 2001, and 2003. These events caused very distinctive polar changes in layers of the Earth's atmosphere known as the stratosphere (12 - 50 km; - 7 - 30 miles) and mesosphere (50 - 90 km; 30 - 55 miles). The solar protons connected with these events created hydrogen- and nitrogen-containing compounds, which led to the polar ozone destruction. The nitrogen-containing compounds, called odd nitrogen, lasted much longer than the hydrogen-containing compounds and led to long-lived stratospheric impacts. An extremely active period for these events occurred in the five-year period, 2000 - 2004, and caused increases in odd nitrogen which lasted for several months after individual events. Associated stratospheric ozone decreases of >lo% were calculated to last for up to five months past the largest events. However, the computed total column ozone and stratospheric temperature changes connected with the solar events were not found to be statistically significant. Thus, solar proton events do not likely contribute significantly to measured total column <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and stratospheric temperature changes...|$|R

30|$|We {{have used}} the {{standard}} deviation, calculated after the removing of the linear trend, of 8 consecutive ozone profiles within a time window of about 4 h {{as a proxy for}} the strength of the fluctuations. The standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of dispersion of a set of data from its mean. The deviation is higher when the data are spread out to the mean, and in our case indicates stronger fluctuations. Since the sampling rate is 30 min, oscillations with periods of 1 h (Nyquist period) to about 8 h will contribute to the calculated standard deviation. An example of these standard deviations is presented in Fig. 3. First panel of Fig. 3 shows the ozone VMR (ppm) through the blue line, the mean of 8 consecutive ozone values (red line) and the standard deviation calculated every 8 ozone values after the removal of the linear trend (red area) at 10 hPa for a time interval of nearly 2 days at the beginning of June 2011. The second panel of Fig. 3 displays the tropospheric transmittance observed for the same interval as the upper panel. This tropospheric transmittance corresponds to cloudy sky cases, in which tropospheric corrections were performed. We cannot find a clear relation between the tropospheric transmittance (green line) and the fluctuations (red area). Later, we quantify that the uncertainty of the ozone retrieval only depends marginal on the tropospheric transmission. We conclude from Fig. 3 that GROMOS measurements are stable over time with a standard deviation around 2 % (0.15 ppm) at 10 hPa (32 km). Generally, the relative amplitudes are stable over time within 5 % in the stratosphere (from 20 to 50 km altitude). In addition, Fig. 3 shows that the amplitudes of natural short-term <b>ozone</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are smaller than 2 % at 10 hPa for the time interval shown, since the fluctuations also contain the influence of the random retrieval error. The resulted time series are due to natural short-term fluctuations and to some random retrieval errors. The random retrieval error includes the thermal noise on the spectra due to the receiver noise, which propagates into the ozone profiles. Unfortunately, this contribution is impossible to discriminate from the retrieval error; nevertheless, we did not find any artificial periodicity in the temporal range of our study (from 1 up to 8 h). Since the mid-latitude stratosphere is known to be quiet during summer, it can be assumed that the retrieval error is mainly due to the random retrieval error (thermal receiver noise) in summer.|$|R

For temperature, the exponent of this dependence is larger in the mid-latitudes than in the tropics at long time scales, while for ozone, the exponent is larger in tropics than in the mid-latitudes. In general, greater persistence could be a result of either stronger positive feedbacks or larger inertia. Therefore, the increased slope of the power distribution of temperature in mid-latitudes at long time scales compared to the slope in the tropics could be connected to the poleward increase in climate sensitivity predicted by the global climate models. The detrended fluctuation analysis of model and observed time series provides a helpful tool for visualizing errors in the treatment of long-range correlations, whose correct modeling would greatly enhance confidence in long-term climate and atmospheric chemistry modeling...|$|R
