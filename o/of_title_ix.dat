5|$|Historically, UM {{regulated}} {{female student}} conduct more than men's conduct {{with a staff}} under the Dean of Women watching over the women. UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report {{on the status of}} women on campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, day care, and a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports. Terry Williams Munz became the first woman in America awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a golf scholarship from UM in 1973.|$|E

40|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{proliferation}} of cases and complaints challenging programmatic disparities in school and college athletic programs that <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> goal <b>of</b> equal treatment has not been fully realized. As the scholarship addressing equal treatment in athletics has been minimal, this Article is an effort to add to this scholarship in order to provide a greater understanding of equal treatment provisions. It examines why many school officials administer athletic departments in apparent oblivion to <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> equal treatment mandate. The Article provides the history <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> equal treatment provisions and their enforcement at the high school and collegiate levels since the 1970 s. Trends in the types of equal treatment violations and the success of both public and private enforcement are also discussed. The Author analyzes why the equal treatment mandate remains largely absent from the public discourse about <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> through a discussion of the political philosophy and climate in the United States, constructions of masculinity, and the role of amateurism in sport. She also offers recommendations to address the relative invisibility <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> equal treatment mandate with the goal of facilitating greater enforcement of equal treatment provisions and improving the overall equality of athletics...|$|R

50|$|Advocates <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX's</b> current {{interpretation}} cite {{increases in}} female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to <b>Title</b> <b>IX.</b> One study, completed in 2006, {{pointed to a}} large {{increase in the number}} of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level. The number of women in high school sports had increased by a factor of nine, while the number of women in college sports had increased by more than 450%. A 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports has grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) Volleyball, 95.7%, (3) Soccer, 92.0%, (4) Cross Country, 90.8%, and (5) Softball, 89.2%.|$|R
25|$|Although many of {{the players}} on earlier teams were playing at colleges, the {{competitions}} were organized by the AAU. Over time, the emphasis shifted to college organizations. The Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women started in 1967, then evolved into the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1971. With the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> in 1972, the growth of women's sports in general, and women's basketball in particular, grew significantly in this era.

25|$|When Summitt {{was in high}} school, {{her family}} moved to nearby Henrietta, so she could play {{basketball}} in Cheatham County because Clarksville {{did not have a}} girls team. From there, Summitt went to University of Tennessee at Martin where {{she was a member of}} Chi Omega Sorority and won All-American honors, playing for UT–Martin's first women's basketball coach, Nadine Gearin. In 1970, with the passage <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> still two years away, there were no athletic scholarships for women. Each of Summitt's brothers had gotten an athletic scholarship, but her parents had to pay her way to college. She later co-captained the United States women's national basketball team as a player at the inaugural women's tournament in the 1976 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. Eight years later in 1984, she coached the U.S. women's team to an Olympic gold medal, becoming the first U.S. Olympian to win a basketball medal and coach a medal-winning team.|$|E
25|$|Although women's {{intramural}} athletics {{had been}} part of the university since it was first established, the first women's intercollegiate athletic team was not established until 1964 when the women's gymnastics team, the first women's collegiate gymnastics team in the U.S., began intercollegiate competition after being founded in 1959. Additional women's sports, including swimming, field hockey, basketball, and volleyball, were added as varsity sports in the mid-1970s following the passage and implementation <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX.</b> Budget constraints and other factors led to the university dropping swimming, tennis, ice hockey, and men's soccer during the 1980s and 1990s, with ice hockey becoming a club-level sport in the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Division I as part of the Great Lakes Collegiate Hockey League (GLCHL). The most recent changes occurred in the late 1990s when women's golf and women's soccer were added as varsity sports. Plans were announced in March 2016 to add a women's lacrosse program for the 2018–19 season, which will play in the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN).|$|E

Another difference found is that men have up to 20 times higher levels of testosterone than women.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1972, Title IX of the [...] "Education Amendments Act of 1972" [...] was passed, and {{it brought}} the {{beginning}} of the most significant change in the history of Alpha Kappa Psi. [...] Title IX prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While social fraternities and sororities were exempt from the provisions <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> <b>IX,</b> professional fraternities were included in Title IX. Around this time, the brothers of the Delta Chi Chapter at Clarkson University introduced legislation to amend Alpha Kappa Psi's Constitution to include women as brothers. While this move did gain the support of a few other chapters, the proposed amendments were easily defeated. [...] In the fall of 1973, the Delta Chi chapter admitted four women into their Chapter and soon granted females full rights and privileges, including participation in ritual. [...] Delta Chi went on to elect a female president and attempted to send her to the 1974 national convention as their voting delegate. [...] As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi revoked the charter of the Delta Chi Chapter. The chapter proceeded by changing its name to Delta Chi Delta aiming to be completely independent from its former counterpart. During the same year, the Alpha Kappa Chapter at the University of Idaho also admitted women to membership. As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi also moved forward with disciplinary action against the Alpha Kappa Chapter. Upon having their charter revoked, the former Alpha Kappa Chapter continued on as an independent organization known as Pi Beta Sigma, and the organization's advisor remarked [...] "My sentiments are that if we are being excommunicated from the national because we failed to discriminate against women, then it's a pleasure to get kicked out of that organization.|$|E
