40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution for}} {{flow in the}} vicinity of an <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> is developed. The observation is emplaced in a homogeneous aquifer of infinite radial extent that is pumped at a constant rate, and satisfies the Theis solution. We attempt to account for the effect of an <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> on the drawdown response in a neighborhood of finite radial extent centered around the well. The model of Black and Kipp [Black, J. H., Kipp Jr., K. L., 1977. <b>Observation</b> <b>well</b> response time and its effect upon aquifer tests. Journal of Hydrology 34, 297 – 306] only makes a correction to the drawdown response at the well location and does not modify the flow pattern in the neighborhood of the well. This may be sufficient for isolated observation wells but, for well-fields or sites with relatively closely spaced wells, the flow patterns in the neighborhoods of the wells may significantly impact drawdown response. The model we develop is applied to field data and is shown to yield an aquifer hydraulic diffusivity that is comparable to that estimated with the model of Black and Kipp [Black, J. H., Kipp Jr., K.

Hybrid methods coupling artificial neural network (ANN) with genetic algorithm (GA) methods (ANN-GA), and simulated annealing (SA) methods (ANN-SA), were utilised. Ratios of depth of pit penetration in aquifer to aquifer thickness, pit bottom radius to its top radius, inverse of pit advance time and the HH in the <b>observation</b> <b>wells</b> to the distance of <b>observation</b> <b>wells</b> from the centre of the pit were used as inputs to the networks.

40|$|Traditional {{analysis}} of aquifer tests uses the observed hydrograph at one well caused by pumping at another well for estimating transmissivity and storage coefficient of an aquifer. The analysis relies on Theis' or Jacob's approximate solution, which assumes aquifer homogeneity. Aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at different scales. If the <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> taps into a low permeability zone while the pumping well {{is located in}} a high permeable zone, the resulting situation contradicts the homogeneity assumption embedded in the traditional analysis. As a result, a practical but important question we ask: What do we derive from the traditional analysis? Using numerical experiments in synthetic aquifers, we answer this question. Results of the experiments indicate that the effective transmissivity, Teff, and storage coefficient, Seff, values vary with time, as well as the principal directions of the transmissivity, but both values approach their geometric means of the aquifer at large times. Analysis of the estimated transmissivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) using well hydrographs from a single <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> shows that at early times, both the estimated T and S values vary with time. At late times, both estimates approach local averages near the <b>observation</b> <b>well.</b> The T value approaches but does not equal Teff, representing an average value over a broad area {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> while the S value converges to the value dominated by the storage coefficient near the observation wells (i. e., its average area is much smaller than that of the t value) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concepts}} of two-way coordinates and one-way coordinates {{are used to}} describe the different characteristics of two key aquifer parameters, transmissivity and storativity, under constant-rate pumping conditions. A two-way coordinate is such that the conditions at a given location are influenced by changes in conditions on either side of that location; a one-way coordinate is such that the conditions at a given location are influenced by changes in conditions on only one side of that location. Results from sensitivity analysis indicate that storativity has the characteristics of two-way coordinates, but transmissivity has the characteristics of one-way coordinates, i. e., its information can be transferred mainly from upstream to downstream. An upstream <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> can produce information on storativity both upstream and downstream, but it can produce little information on transmissivity downstream. These characteristics of the aquifer parameters have important implications on pumping-test designs and interpretation. For example, to estimate the parameters of an anomalous zone in an aquifer, an <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> should be located downstream but near the zone. It should not be placed upstream if the parameters downstream are to be estimated. An <b>observation</b> <b>well</b> which can provide adequate information for estimating storativity may not provide adequate information for estimating transmissivity, and vice versa.
