Building {{on some of the}} concepts of the Wilkie model developed in 1984, <b>the</b> <b>TY</b> Model features a fundamentally different and unique approach to modelling equities. The model was designed using modern statistical techniques as well as a wider data set. Upgrading the standard actuarial valuation into a stochastic risk assessment is the way of the future, and <b>the</b> <b>TY</b> Model was built with this objective in mind. <b>The</b> <b>TY</b> Model has already been successfully used for UK pension fund applications. Actuaries advising life insurance companies, general insurance companies and other funds with long term liabilities will find <b>the</b> <b>TY</b> Model to be a valuable tool. Whatever the area of application, using the model will assist the understanding of the source and nature of the financial and economic risks to which a fund is exposed, enabling more informed decisions and a better management of risk. We believe that <b>the</b> <b>TY</b> Model has <b>the</b> following qualities: • Clarity of Design. <b>The</b> <b>TY</b> Model’s clear structure incorporates understandable inputs with a direct economic meaning.

They further pressed the court for a summary ruling directing the FHWA and INDOT to route I-69 over I-70 and US 41. Judge David Hamilton disagreed, and on December 10, 2007, he issued a 58-page ruling upholding the selected route for I-69 and <b>the</b> <b>Tier</b> 1 ROD.
