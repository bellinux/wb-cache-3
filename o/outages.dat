40|$|Abstract — This paper {{combines}} {{the concepts of}} ergodic capacity and capacity versus <b>outage</b> for fading channels, and explores variable rate transmissions under a service <b>outage</b> constraint in a block flat fading channel model. A service <b>outage</b> occurs when the transmission rate is below a given basic rate. We {{solve the problem of}} maximizing the expected rate subject to the average power constraint and the service <b>outage</b> probability constraint. When the problem is feasible, the optimum power policy is shown to be a combination of water filling and channel inversion allocation, where the <b>outage</b> occurs at a set of channel states below a certain threshold. The service <b>outage</b> approach resolves the conflicting objectives of high average rate and low <b>outage</b> probability.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, <b>outage</b> {{regions are}} {{computed}} for the quasi-static fading multiple access channel (MAC) with {{constraints on the}} individual user <b>outage</b> probabilities and no channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). An <b>outage</b> rate region {{is defined as the}} set of rate vectors for which the user <b>outage</b> probability constraints are satisfied simultaneously. <b>Outage</b> probability is typically defined in terms of a common <b>outage</b> event, defined as the event that a target user rate vector lies outside the achievable region of the MAC, conditioned on the fading state. In contrast, rate regions without CSIT are computed in this paper based on individual <b>outage</b> events and individual probability constraints that are satisfied simultaneously. An individual <b>outage</b> event for a given user occurs if the user’s message is not correctly decoded, irrespective of the decoding success of the messages for other users. Individual <b>outage</b> rate regions are useful for the MAC with heterogeneous user channels and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Explicit <b>outage</b> rate regions and total throughputs are computed for the two-user fading MAC. It is shown that rate regions and throughputs are significantly larger using individual <b>outage</b> probabilities than using the common <b>outage</b> probability. I...|$|R
30|$|The <b>outage</b> {{performance}} of the dual-hop OFDM fixed gain AF relay system is analyzed in Rayleigh fading with BTB SCM and WTB SCM. The analysis is done {{on the basis of}} <b>outage</b> probability and <b>outage</b> capacity performances. Accurate close-form expressions for the <b>outage</b> probability and <b>outage</b> capacity are derived. The analysis shows that ordered SCM schemes results in categorization of subcarrier-pairs into best, moderate, and poor subsets of pairs. The BTB SCM scheme outperforms the WTB SCM scheme on the basis of <b>outage</b> probability for best and moderate sets of subcarrier pairs. The <b>outage</b> {{performance of}} poor set of subcarrier pairs is comparable in both schemes and show lower <b>outage</b> only in the high SNR regime. On the basis of <b>outage</b> capacity performance comparison, it is concluded that the BTB SCM scheme outperforms the WTB SCM scheme for all range of SNR. Specifically, in low and medium SNR regimes, a significant gain in <b>outage</b> capacity can be achieved. Furthermore, it is shown that the percentage increase in <b>outage</b> capacity due to BTB SCM decreases as the SNR increases.|$|R

30|$|The <b>outage</b> {{probability}} and <b>outage</b> capacity {{analysis for}} a single-carrier system {{provide the basis}} for analysis of a multicarrier system. The <b>outage</b> analysis for single-carrier and OFDM systems has been studied in the literature. In particular, [17] presents the <b>outage</b> behavior of fundamental relaying protocols, i.e., AF and DF relaying for high SNR. In [18], close-form expressions are derived for the AF as well as DF relaying system for all SNR regimes. In [19], cooperative communication protocol is proposed for multiuser OFDM network while considering relay-assignment based on <b>outage</b> probability analysis for uplink transmission. In [20], <b>outage</b> probability bounds are derived for a multicarrier cooperative AF relaying system. In [21], asymptotic approximation for the upper bound of <b>outage</b> probability for an OFDM system in Rayleigh fading is presented. In [22], the <b>outage</b> probability and <b>outage</b> capacity analysis for a dual-hop OFDM DF relay system is presented while approximating the probability distribution function (PDF) of total capacity by Gaussian distribution for a single-user scenario. In [23], <b>outage</b> probability analysis for an OFDM half-duplex relaying system is presented. In [24], <b>outage</b> probability analysis presented by [22] is extended for a multiuser OFDMA DF relaying system. Although the above literature provides analysis of <b>outage</b> probability and <b>outage</b> capacity for an OFDM system, yet these do not consider ordered SCM schemes in a dual-hop OFDM relaying system which is challenging due to its inherited complexity. In [25], the <b>outage</b> probability and <b>outage</b> capacity analysis is presented while considering ordered SCM; nevertheless, it is limited to the BTB SCM scheme only.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{asymptotic}} <b>outage</b> perfor-mance of incremental redundancy automatic-repeat-request (INR-ARQ) transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) block-fading channels with discrete input constellations. We first show that transmission with random codes using a dis-crete signal constellation across all transmit antennas achieves the optimal <b>outage</b> diversity {{given by the}} Singleton bound. The optimal SNR-exponent and <b>outage</b> diversity of INR-ARQ trans-mission over the MIMO block-fading channel are then analysed. We show that a significant gain in <b>outage</b> diversity is obtained by providing more than one bit feedback at each ARQ round. Thus, the <b>outage</b> performance of INR-ARQ transmission can be remarkably improved with minimal additional overhead. A practical feedback-and-power-adaptation rule is proposed for MIMO INR-ARQ, demonstrating the benefits provided by multibit feedback. Although the rule is sub-optimal in terms of <b>outage</b> performance, it achieves the optimal <b>outage</b> diversity.

40|$|This paper explores a spectrally efficient, {{variable}} rate transmission scheme under a service <b>outage</b> constraint for a block fading channel model.

Unlike an information <b>outage</b> in the capacity versus <b>outage</b> problem, asymptotically error free communication is maintained during a service <b>outage.</b> We solve the problem of maximizing the time average transmission code rate subject to the probability of service <b>outage</b> being sufficiently small. When the problem is feasible, the optimum power policy is shown to be a combination of water filling and channel inversion allocations.

30|$|We {{introduce}} the <b>outage</b> throughput as the performance measure for the downlink throughput. Here, we define the <b>outage</b> throughput as the maximum expected rate of information delivered to users in non-outage states, where the data rate {{is lower than}} the channel capacity. Clearly, the definition of <b>outage</b> throughput is {{different from that of the}} ergodic throughput, which is defined as a long-term achievable throughput averaged over all fading blocks [7]. The performance measure of the ergodic throughput is suitable for applications insensitive to delay, but not suitable for delay-sensitive applications. For the latter ones, the <b>outage</b> probability has been considered as a valid performance measure [8 – 10]. It is desirable to minimize the <b>outage</b> probability for the given quantized CSI. However, low <b>outage</b> probability results in low throughput. There exists a tradeoff between minimizing the <b>outage</b> probability and maximizing the throughput. <b>Outage</b> throughput, which can be regarded as a measure of the expected reliably decodable rate at the user side, provides this tradeoff between transmission rate and <b>outage</b> probability [11, 12].|$|R
