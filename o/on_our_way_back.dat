60|$|But {{the hour}} wanes while we stand and admire; the surf dashes nearer and nearer to our feet; soon, the sea {{will cover the}} sand, and rush swiftly into the caves where we have slowly crawled. Already the Devil's Bellows is at work--the jets of spray spout forth from it with a roar. The sea thunders louder and louder in the Devil's Throat--we must gain the cliffs while we have yet time. The guide takes his leave; my {{companion}} unwillingly closes his sketch-book; and we slowly ascend <b>on</b> <b>our</b> inland <b>way</b> together--looking <b>back</b> often and often, with no feigned regret, on all that we are leaving behind us at KYNANCE COVE.|$|R
6000|$|We kept <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> often looking <b>back</b> towards Loch Lomond, and {{wondering}} at the grandeur which Ben Vain and Ben Voirlich, {{and the rest}} of the Ben fraternity, had suddenly put on. The mists which had hung about them all day had now descended lower, and lay among the depths and gorges of the hills, where also the sun shone softly down among them, and filled those deep mountain laps, as it were, with a dimmer sunshine. Ben Vain, too, and his brethren, had a veil of mist all about them, which seemed to render them really transparent; and they had unaccountably grown higher, vastly higher, than when we viewed them from the shore of the lake. It was as if we were looking at them through the medium of a poet's imagination. All along the road, since we left Inversnaid, there had been the stream, which there formed the waterfall, and which here was brawling down little declivities, and sleeping in black pools, which we disturbed by flinging stones into them from the roadside. We passed a drunken old gentleman, who civilly bade me [...] "good day"; and a man and woman at work in a field, the former of whom shouted to inquire the hour; and we had come in sight of little Loch Arklet before the omnibus came up with us. It was about five o'clock when we reached the head of ...|$|R

6000|$|Before {{they formed}} up to march to their work, Godfrey {{shook hands with}} his friend Osip. [...] "I am going to try <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to-night," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The shot told. Your aunt bounced up at once, and in {{ten minutes}} more was in my carriage, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to London. There, sir, was not that generalship?" ...|$|E

60|$|We separated. Ralph {{was unusually}} silent and serious <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back.</b> He took leave of {{me at the}} door of my lodging, very abruptly; without {{referring}} again to our visit to the hospital.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> that we {{came upon}} the dead rabbit. The red body of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs {{stripped}} white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed.|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} in the plantation. It was very dark--so dark, that we found some {{difficulty}} in keeping the path. I gave Laura my arm, and we walked {{as fast as we}} could <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{realized}} {{the futility of}} any attempt to dissuade her; so we left her there, spent an hour at the Academy and did a little shopping. <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> an idea occurred to me.
