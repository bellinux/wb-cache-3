Therefore, he continued the tradition of the general running of games being entrusted to a Field Sports Board (sometimes referred to as the Field Sports Committee), composed of the [...] "school captain, captains of cricket, football (rugby), gymnastics, the baths (swimming), fencing, fives, athletics sports, boxing and shooting". Gilkes had it that the only masters with authorised status with regards to games were the captain of the Rifle Corps, and treasurer of the Sports Board. By 1894 there no more masters on the Field Sports Committee. The Board at the time controlled the appointment of captains and had some say in the style of blazers that could be worn as uniform. It was the Field Sports Committee, for example, that governed the award of the college's most prestigious colours, the white blazer. The system today is very different with assistant masters now being in charge of games, and acting more as coaches.|$|E
50|$|Construction and {{renovation}} of the Mont Albert Road campus continued throughout the 1970s and early-1980s as the School headed towards its centenary. A new resource centre, the L.W. Weickhardt Library, a ‘David Dyer’ Physical Education Centre (replacing a decrepit, portable “Old Gym” from Burke Road), the Canon W. Holt Wing for Grade 6 students and the inauguration of the Junior School at “Norge” were amongst them, as the School continued to obtain possession of neighbouring properties in a steady process of physical consolidation {{as an alternative to}} any suggestion of expansion elsewhere. The present <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>School</b> into Junior, Middle and Senior sections was formalised in 1983/84, in time for the much anticipated centenary of 1986, during which the school community reflected on its first century. There was much to reflect upon, as was made clear in the commissioned, centennial history By Their Deeds written by the scholarly educator Dr Ian Hansen and launched with appropriate ceremony by the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen at the Camberwell Civic Centre. Centenary commemorations began with a service at St Paul’s Cathedral, followed by a Centenary Family Day in April. A spectacular Centenary Revue at St. Kilda, a Centenary School Concert at the Melbourne Concert Hall and a Centenary Old Boy’s Dinner all marked the strengths and diversity of school life throughout the year. The School now contained over 1100 students and over 9200 had passed through its various portals in the previous 100 years.|$|E
5000|$|Father Richard Kenefeck, {{who succeeded}} him, {{was the longest}} serving Headmaster in the Vaughan's history, {{presiding}} over the School's development for {{nearly a quarter of}} a century, Richard Kenefeck was ordained in 1935 and went on to read English at Downing College, Cambridge. He was appointed to the Vaughan in 1938 and spent his whole working life at the School. He came with the reputation of being a brilliant footballer and immediately took charge of sports and games. He also taught Religious Education, Latin and English, Father Kenefeck was known for his sincere concern for the spiritual development of his pupils. He also acquired the reputation of a strict disciplinarian. To a degree, Father Kenefeck lived under the shadow of Dr Vance and Monsignor Butcher and was perhaps conscious that he lacked their charisma. Nevertheless, his achievements were considerable in their own right, his priorities as Headmaster summed up In a little booklet he wrote entitled 'A Talk to Parents of New Boys': 'No Catholic school would be fulfilling its purpose if its sole occupation were to push knowledge into more or less receptive heads. All Catholics know that education should deal With the personality as a whole. And Catholic education views the person primarily as a child of God Education fits a boy for life. But life fits a boy for eternal life. Therefore, the knowledge, love and practice of religion stand before all else. If a boy finishes his school training as a Catholic gentleman, he will have qualities beyond price.' It is that phrase, ca Catholic gentleman', that sums up Father Kenefeck's aims in education. He himself could have been described as ca Catholic priest and gentleman'. He had a simple devotion to the Catholic faith and that, above all, is what he wanted to pass on to the pupils. As the 1950s gave way to the 1960s, Father Kenefeck found teaching Religious Education to the Sixth Form a more troublesome and demanding task. Father Terry Phipps, then a pupil, remarks, 'It was sad to see Father Kenefeck struggling to keep up with a questioning generation in religion. His definition of religion, I remember, laid immense stress on the root meaning of the word 'to bind', which seemed to him to mean that religion was all to do with rules and regulations — not something that went down well in the late 1960s.' To the boys he seemed a remote figure but his Deputy and successor, Anthony Pellegrini, thought of him as a most kindly man who was also very modest about his accomplishments. I was astonished to discover his flair as a painter.' Father Kenefeck's early years as Headmaster were occupied with concerns — the expansion of the Sixth Form and the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>School</b> as a grammar school in new buildings. New Advanced A-Level subjects such as English, Geography and Economics were introduced to a Sixth Form which had been largely devoted to Classics, and from 1956 Mathematics and the Sciences were added. The question of a new building had occupied the Governors since the Vaughan had acquired voluntary aided status. The roll was steadily increasing and the question of recruiting a third form of entry was first discussed as early as 1955, but not finally agreed by the London County Council until December 1961, In February 1959 Cardinal Godfrey was able to announce to the Governors that negotiations were now in hand for the building of an entirely new Vaughan School. When this news was first received, Father Kenefeck had wanted to re-create the Preparatory Department in the old building but this plan was abandoned with the increase to three forms of entry.On 6 June 1964, the new building was officially opened and blessed by Archbishop Heenan of Westminster in the presence of governors, teachers, parents, past and present pupils and the Mayor of London. Very appropriately, the ceremony marked the Golden Jubilee of the School's foundation in 1914. The School had hardly settled into its new accommodation when the word which was to dominate the next quarter of a century appeared, reorganisation. By 1966 the then Labour government of Harold Wilson had committed itself to the policy of comprehensive education. Long and protracted negotiations about the Vaughan's future status were about to begin. In April 1968, the uncertainty was ended, for the moment, when it was proposed by the ILEA that the Vaughan should remain a three-form grammar school pending amalgamation as an eight-form comprehensive after 1975'. By 1972 the governors were once again considering new reorganisation proposals and were involved in long negotiations with the Westminster Diocesan Schools' Commission and the Inner London Education Authority. In retrospect one is struck by the inordinate amount of time that had to be given to these proposals and the constantly changing plans appear quite bewildering. At different times there were plans for the Vaughan to amalgamate with St Edmund's, Fulham, using the Mary Boon buildings or, alternatively, to amalgamate with the Cardinal Manning School on the Ladbroke Upper Site. Despite this worrying background of uncertainty about the future, the School continued to develop in many areas. One of Father Kenefeck's innovations was to introduce parent/ teacher meetings. It seems incredible that such meetings had not been held prior to 1954 but the result was deemed 'everywhere most helpful, most instructive, most edifying [...] School journeys abroad grew under Father Kenefeck. Groups of Vaughan boys visited Germany, Belgium, Norway, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the United States. The United States was immensely popular and possibly seen as not quite so 'foreign' as Europe. On one top in 1975, Father Henry Young 'who had been planning this top ever since he got back from the last one' took a group of sw.r-een In two Plymouth 8-seat estate cars on a trek across the mid- west. They were delighted with their friendly reception — 'You British? Clad to know you! Camping? My!' Perhaps the most loved of all teachers during these years was Mr Frank Handyside. Frank {{was one of the last}} teachers to be appointed by Dr Vance and took up his duties under Monsignor Butcher in 1948 until his retirement in 1978. His greatest contribution was as a Form Master. Understanding and sympathetic, Mr Handyside was much loved by the boys. When he suffered a long illness in 1954, the hospital staff were amazed at the continual flow of boys who came to visit 'Handyl It could only have been Handy who passed on to the young Stephen Arthur (in a French lesson) the valuable information that the Café Royal in London was at the time one of the few places in the UK where one could obtain calvados. The school cap which was compulsory until the early 1960s seems to have made an enormous impression, especially because of the various shapes and sizes it could be squeezed into when wet. The caps had enormous peaks and there were four different coloured buttons to show which house you belonged to. They were extremely unpopular with the boys who considered that prefects and teachers expended a ridiculous amount of energy trying to make people wear them until the end of the third year. The caps and the general grammar school air may have been too provocative for pupils in the neighbouring Holland Park School. Whatever the reason, there developed a feud between the two schools which led to the Vaughan's lunch-break being shortened by thirty minutes to avoid clashes. Former pupils of this period almost universally acknowledge that the Vaughan influenced their lives in many ways. Most, If not all, are proud to have been 'Vaughan boys.' ...|$|E

40|$|Most Hong Kong {{secondary}} schools have two teams of guidance and discipline teachers to manage students’ misbehaviour. The guidance team is mainly {{responsible for providing}} a personal counselling service and for carrying out guidance programmes, such as sex education. The discipline team works with {{students who have been}} identified as having behavioural problems. They are also responsible for enforcing discipline policy, such as <b>the</b> wearing <b>of</b> <b>school</b> uniform. Most teachers and school managers are concerned with <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> integrating guidance and discipline into schooling. Many studies have shown that guidance teachers are described as ‘soft’ whereas discipline teachers as described as ‘strict’ and ‘tough’. Each team of teachers has a contrasting rationale as to how best to help students resolve their difficulties. However, no research has yet been completed into how guidance and discipline are implemented in the classroom. This article focuses on this area and reports a study of what classroom knowledge teachers and students construct, with respect to the relationship between guidance and discipline.

40|$|In {{this study}} the authors {{start from the}} {{observed}} fact that equality of opportunities of educational achievement is higher in integrated school systems than in differentiated school systems. In other words, in integrated school systems, a pupil's school achievement depends less than elsewhere on {{the social and cultural}} resources of his or her family. However, before concluding that school structure has a significant influence on inequalities at school, it is important to distinguish between the influence of the socio-economic context underlying each school system, and the specific influence of the structure or <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> system itself. The fact is that not only do the most egalitarian countries with regard to schooling have in common an integrated structure, but also these schools are set within the context of countries which are more egalitarian in other ways, particularly with regard to income distribution. To distinguish between the influence of this social environment and that of school structure, the authors offer three analyses based on a comparative analysis of international databases measuring educational achievement. The results of these three analyses lend credence to the hypothesis that the structure of the school system has a specific effect on the extent of inequalities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. {{his thesis}} {{reports on a}} {{qualitative}} study of stakeholders’ constructions <b>of</b> gender in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Free Primary Education policy in three primary schools in Lesotho. Through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social constructionist paradigm, the thesis examines how parents, teachers and children living in and around these primary schools think, act, and feel in relation to gender in their academic and social worlds. It looks at {{the ways in which}} these stakeholders engage with issues of gender in Lesotho communities ravaged by gender inequality. Based on parents’, teachers’ and children’s constructions <b>of</b> gender, <b>the</b> thesis suggests strategies that might help address inequitable gender relations in and around <b>the</b> primary <b>schools.</b> <b>The</b> thesis grounded my personal life experiences, as the researcher, as crucial in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> methodological strategies and processes of this study. In a flexible and responsive manner, the study utilised informal conversations, semistructured interviews, observations, questionnaires and document analysis, as methods of data collection. It found that, influenced by ‘discursive constructs’ of providence and God’s will, child-adult relations, naturalness of gender differences and attributes as well as the Basotho culture, parents and teachers constructed gender in ways that reinforced existing gender inequality in and around <b>the</b> primary <b>schools.</b> <b>The</b> structural and social <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> that tended to allocate girls and boys into rigid social categories, and parents’ and teachers’ constructions of gender which reinforced inequitable gender relations, were found to have significant impact on <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> children’s experiences and meanings <b>of</b> gender. <b>The</b> study found that children’s experiences of gender informed how they actively engaged with issues <b>of</b> gender and <b>the</b> meanings they attached to being girls and boys. The study traces how Basotho culture and religion have been fundamental to gender inequality and violence in Lesotho. These factors encouraged <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> to use structural/physical identities (such as having biological sex as a boy/girl), as the bases for allocation of girls and boys into rigid and inequitable social categories. <b>The</b> dominant discourses <b>of</b> gender that emanated from these factors, ascribed stereotypic attributes to males (boys and men) and females (girls and women) as means to ground inequitable gendered human aptitudes, which were used to justify gender inequality. The study also identifies ways in which girls defy the insistence on their subordination, and sees fault lines where gender inequality can be confronted without abandoning Basotho culture...|$|R
40|$|Focusing {{on gender}} {{relations}} in a working class co-educational school, this paper {{reports on the}} differences in power, status and control when {{male and female students}} interact with school-based curricular processes. The research site provided an interesting arena for <b>the</b> empowerment <b>of</b> pupils, particularly female, through a negotiated school-based curriculum fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>school</b> <b>organisation.</b> This paper aims to portray teacher/student negotiations in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> classwork and classroom behaviour and <b>the</b> making <b>of</b> appropriate subject selections, a process which portrays an experimental interaction between students and <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school.</b> <b>The</b> research identified areas linked closely to emerging shifts in female student career options, as well as reflecting perspectives relevant to policy and theory development for the 1990 s...|$|R
50|$|In 1883 Elgar was {{appointed}} to <b>the</b> first professorship <b>of</b> naval architecture to be established in a university; it was founded at Glasgow by <b>the</b> widow <b>of</b> John Elder, <b>the</b> marine engineer. Although permitted to continue private practice, Elgar during {{the next three years}} mainly devoted himself to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>school.</b> His personal reputation secured <b>the</b> sympathy <b>of</b> shipowners and shipbuilders, and attracted many students. In 1886 Elgar on <b>the</b> invitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admiralty re-entered the public service as director of dockyards, a newly created office. During his six years' control, work in the dockyards was done more economically and rapidly than before. Resigning this appointment in 1892, he was until 1907 consulting naval architect and director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company <b>of</b> Glasgow. <b>The</b> company, founded by John Elder and developed by Sir William Pearce, fully maintained its position during Elgar's management. The works were enlarged and improved, and their productive capacity increased. Novel types of vessels were designed and built, including torpedo-boat destroyers and cross-Channel steamers of high speed. Steam turbines and water-tube boilers were employed at an early date, with satisfactory results.|$|R
