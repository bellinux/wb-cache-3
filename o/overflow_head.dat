40|$|This diploma thesis {{dealt with}} the {{influence}} of relative weir height of rectangular broad-crested weir on discharge coefficient. Based on the level measurement in front of weir for different heights of the weir P and discharges were determined values of discharge coefficient according h/P. These values were compared {{with the results of}} measurements and relationships, which are mentioned in the professional literature. In conclusion were derived new relationships {{that can be used to}} calculate the discharge coefficient relative to the <b>overflow</b> <b>head...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{general the}} {{coefficient}} of discharge for various types of measuring structures constructed in an open channel can be found from a standard formula. These structures such as a broad-crested weir, sharp-crested weir and circular-crested weir have a constant shape under all overflow conditions; therefore {{the relationship between the}} head and discharge over the structures can be found. In the case of inflatable dams this relationship is more complex than traditional measuring structures because the dimensions of inflatable dams may be varied due to internal pressure, <b>overflow</b> <b>head</b> and downstream water head. In this study {{the coefficient of}} discharge for inflatable dams was determined from the experimental data under different overflow heads and internal pressures for an air inflated dam...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is carried out to improve quality level by {{identifying}} the prime reasons of the quality related problems in the seat hardfacing process involving the deposition of cobalt based super alloy in I. C. Engine valves using TIG welding process. During the Process, defects like stellite deposition <b>overflow,</b> <b>head</b> melt, non-uniform stellite merging, etc., are observed and combining all these defects, the rejection level was in top position in Forge shop. We use widely referred QC tools of the manufacturing field to monitor the complete operation and continuous progressive process improvement to ensure ability and efficiency of quality management system of any firm. The work aims to identify the various causes for the rejection by the detailed study of the operation, equipment, materials and the various process parameters that {{are very important to}} get defects-free products. Also, to evolve suitable countermeasures for reducing the rejection percentage using seven QC tools. To further understand and validate the obtained results, we need to address other studies related to motivations, advantages, and disadvantages of applying quality control tools...|$|E
5000|$|The Grogol River arises around [...] in Desa Kedungbadak {{and runs}} north between the Krukut River {{to the east}} and the Pasanggrahan River to the west, further north the Sekretaris River (Secretaris River) arises to the west. The Grogol passes through Desa Sukadamai and Desa Kencana. After {{crossing}} Jakarta Outer Ringroad (Jalan Tol Lingkar Luar Jakarta) it follows parallel to and just east of Route 12. At [...] there is an overflow channel that goes west to the Pasanggrahan River. The Grogol continues north through Senayan City and just west of Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. It serves to drain the Palmerah Urban Village. Beginning at Bank Danamon Central Park it parallels Route 1 until [...] where an <b>overflow</b> channel <b>heads</b> due west to join the Sekretaris River, while the channelized river continues beside Route 1 and flows into the Krucut River at [...]|$|R
50|$|La Jarosa {{reservoir}} is {{the most}} important to the Guadarrama municipality. It is the only source of drinking water supply for the Guadarrama municipality as well as for Alpedrete, El Escorial and San Lorenzo de El Escorial. It has a capacity of 7.2 hmÂ³, however most of the times it does not reach its full capacity. Incoming water to the swamp comes out of the Guatel stream, the La Jarosa stream and the Las Cerradillas stream. Two dams had to be built to contain these waters. One dam is to cut the flow of the La Jarosa stream and the other serves to prevent <b>overflow</b> into the <b>head</b> of the Fuente Cornejo stream.|$|R
5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain <b>overflow.</b> Mulder <b>heads</b> in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half. Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from Chernobyl, and that the creature was created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|R
40|$|Most of spillways {{failure in}} Indonesia {{are caused by}} local {{scouring}} that happens continuously at downstream, and at time local scouring get the foot of spillway will dangerous for its operational. This scour occurs because of advanced value of specific energy <b>overflow</b> with high <b>head</b> relatively so that it appear unbalance velocity flow and turbulence flow. An effort to protect foot spillway is build the structure energy dissipator. From this concept at foot spillway is designed with one, two, or more energy dissipator agree with condition and many variables at deform process mechanism appropriately. At laboratory two dimensional physical test had done the consideration of spillway with bucket of type stilling basin to conventional spillway and having USBR III stilling basin at many discharges pattern and its influence for hydraulic jump bucket flow, energy reduction, along with local scour at downstream. This local scouring was caused by major water flowing passing the dam {{where there is a}} high difference level between the top {{and the end of the}} dam. Furthermore, it generates inbalancing water flow speed and additional water turbulence. There are different approachs to prevent such damage, and for example by providing one or more additional construction at the end part of the dam. This structure is designed and installed at the bottom part of the dam. Various empirical functions have been developed to design this structure, and one of them is developed by Lacey, Laursen, Froehlich, Mellvile and so on. However, that function has some limitation. For examples are the local river and dam construction characteristics. Therefore, it is required to be validated by developing a model of dam contructed in a laboratory. Experiments was undertaken by using the model with different characteristics of water flow in order to investigate the scouring patter...|$|R
