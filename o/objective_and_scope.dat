50|$|Just before General Olusegun Obasanjo {{handed over}} {{power to the}} {{civilian}} regime of Alhaji Shehu Shagari, the NSO started a program of infiltrating government agencies and establishments that were to be inherited by the new civilian administration. The NSO at this time was still a largely military oriented agency, which still had a serving army officer as its Director-General and the outgoing military administration was largely suspicious of the incoming civilians. This situation led to the NSO posting active duty operatives under cover within the administrative structure to be inherited by the civilian administration {{with a view to}} gathering first hand intelligence on the daily operations of the new administration. A former special adviser to President Shehu Shagari on National Assembly matters, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai remembered meeting two such operatives during his time in detention at the SSS headquarters during the Babangida regime. One of the operatives was a messenger in the office of Dr. Joseph Wayas, the second republic senate president while the other worked as a personal assistant to Alhaji Bello Maitama, the minister of commerce in the Shagari administration. One of the operatives revealed the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the operation to Yakasai, informing him that their cover had been established before the new administration took over and also that they had been posted to various government ministries.|$|E

CbC reporting will require certain multinationals to provide reports to the Australian Tax Office outlining their global financial activities.

Project aims can be too vague, too numerous, misdirected or unachievable. A project can solve the wrong problem. What stakeholders want is not enough. What the project proponents think the stakeholders need, can be misperception. Projects must meet real needs, yet often they do not, constituting waste of donor, investor or taxpayer funds. Involuntary stakeholders must be identified and properly informed, which may extend to teaching them how to assess the impacts of a project on their lives, properties and livelihoods.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} a method ensuring quality of aeronautical data. European Union (among others UE 73 / 2010) as well as international (among others ICAO Annex 15) regulations introduce a number of requirements regarding the quality and safety of aeronautical data.

However with their <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> they determine mainly the specifications and requirements that are to be implemented and compatible. Mentioned regulations also refer to selected international standards (e. g. ISO 19157), focused on quality and safety of geographic data and information.

40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{available}} ontology engineering methodologies presuppose {{the existence of a}} set of questions which provide the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the ontology under development. However, these so-called competency questions are not always clear from start. In this sense, such competency questions are comparable to system requirements, elicited and modeled during the requirements engineering stage of a software development process. Having this in mind, this work proposes the use of the Tropos methodology to help the ontology engineer reason and model competency questions. For that, he should follow the traditional Tropos process, starting with the early requirements activity to analyze the objectives of an organization. This initial stage is followed by the late requirements activity, in which the competency question are captured and linked to the organization’s goals, following the goal modeling process. In this way, we aim at providing a methodology which will consistently drive the ontology engineer in developing an ontology from scratch...|$|E
