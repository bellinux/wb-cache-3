5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. <b>One</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{positioned}} at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new quay built along the harbour, {{near the entrance}} to the estuary, and was intended to engage any hostile ships that evaded the guns of Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It probably originally took the form of a circular tower, similar to the gun tower at Dartmouth Castle. In 1575, the fort was leased by the town to Thomas Carne, a shipwright, subject to it being returned to the town authorities if necessary for the defence of the town. During the 1598 Spanish invasion scare, the town authorities took over control of the fort in accordance with the agreement.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. <b>One</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this {{he was awarded the}} Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{bacterial}} {{heat shock}} locus HslU ATPase and HslV peptidase together form an ATP-dependent HslVU protease. Bacterial HslVU is <b>a</b> homolog <b>of</b> the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. Crystallographic studies of HslVU should provide <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> ATP-dependent protein unfolding, translocation, and proteolysis by {{this and other}} ATP-dependent proteases. Results: We present a 3. 0 Å resolution crystal structure <b>of</b> HslVU with <b>an</b> HslU hexamer bound at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HslV dodecamer. The structure shows that the central pores of the ATPase and peptidase are {{next to each other}} and aligned. The central pore of HslU consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GYVG motif, which is conserved among protease-associated ATPases. The binding of one HslU hexamer to <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HslV dodecamer in the 3. 0 Å resolution structure opens both HslV central pores and induces asymmetric changes in HslV. Conclusions: Analysis of nucleotide binding induced conformational changes in the current and previous HslU structures suggests a protein unfolding–coupled translocation mechanism. In this mechanism, unfolded polypeptides are threaded through the aligned pores of the ATPase and peptidase and translocated into the peptidase central chamber...|$|R
