5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E

25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use <b>of</b> <b>Sewage</b> <b>Sludge,</b> with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> modified <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> as landfill cover material and its performance in a complex landfill environment, strength and hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted. The permeability requirements for daily and interim covers were analyzed first. Based on saturated-unsaturated seepage calculations, {{it is suggested that}} approximately 1. 0  ×  10 − 4  cm/s and 1. 0  ×  10 − 5  cm/s are the appropriate values for the hydraulic conductivities of daily and interim covers, respectively. The strength and permeability requirements of the mixtures, when used as an interim cover, can be met at a sludge:lime:cement:silt:tire-derived aggregate (TDA) weight ratio of 100 : 15 : 5 : 70 : 15. Results also demonstrate that the solid content ratio <b>of</b> modified <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge,</b> which should be greater than 60 % when modified <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is used as a temporary cover material, is crucial to both strength and hydraulic performance. In addition, as the duration of soaking <b>of</b> modified <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> in synthetic leachate increases, the unconfined compressive strength increases, and the hydraulic conductivity decreases slightly or fluctuates between 1. 0  ×  10 − 5  cm/s and 1. 0  ×  10 − 6  cm/s, still meeting the requirements for an interim cover.

25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} sludge {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge.</b> Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.|$|E
25|$|The amount <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{produced}} from the activated sludge process is {{directly proportional to}} the amount of wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste activated sludge from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70–100kg/ML of waste activated sludge (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3). A value of 80kg/ML is regarded as being typical. In addition, about 110–170kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.|$|E
25|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that}} do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{co-disposal}} <b>of</b> dewatered <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{and municipal}} solid waste may cause significant impacts (such as total and differential settlement, slope stability of the waste, and leachability) on landfill operations and the subsurface environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the co-disposal <b>of</b> dewatered <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> and {{municipal solid waste}} with respect to their consolidation characteristics, vane shear strength, and leachability. The results of the consolidation tests show that, for a given stress increment, the deformation (the change in the void ratio) <b>of</b> the dewatered <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is larger than the deformation of its sludge mixtures. When the sludge ratio in the mixture increases, the compressibility of the mixture increases. The total consolidation settlement taking place in landfilling <b>of</b> dewatered <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> alone would be much greater than that for co-disposal of sludge with solid waste. The results of the shear stress strength tests of the sludge and its mixtures imply that side slopes of 20 º can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing a sliding problem. Based on the results of the column leachability tests, Fe, Cu and nitrogen leached out from the sludge and its mixture might cause groundwater pollution. ...|$|R
