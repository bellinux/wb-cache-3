5|$|In the 2000s, {{photographer}} Mark Sadan informally led the Sunday Photo Group, {{which had}} about 24 members and met at All Saints', {{on the second}} Sunday of each month. In late 2006, the church was featured <b>on</b> <b>Nightline</b> and USA Today for hosting U2charists, Eucharists accompanying U2 songs; the church has held two such services.

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel <b>on</b> <b>Nightline</b> about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired <b>on</b> <b>Nightline.</b> At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, Vincennes was passing through the Strait of Hormuz {{returning}} from an escort duty.

2500|$|Trudeau {{has been}} criticized for his {{inability}} to provide evidence to back up his claims. Although he recites anecdotes, he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners. In instances where Trudeau has been asked to provide proof, he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies. For example, Trudeau cited a nonexistent 25-year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the University of Calgary. When ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper confronted him <b>on</b> <b>Nightline,</b> Trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it; he never did. He later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry. [...] In 2006 University of Calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of Trudeau's claims about the university's research were true, and that its attorneys had sent Trudeau a [...] "cease and desist" [...] letter, demanding that he stop associating himself with the school.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{assuming}} {{his leadership}} role, Miscavige has been faced with press accounts regarding alleged illegal and unethical {{practices of the}} Church of Scientology or by Miscavige himself. A 1991 Time magazine cover story on the church described Miscavige as [...] "ringleader" [...] of a [...] "hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner". Miscavige stated <b>on</b> <b>Nightline</b> that {{the publication of the}} article resulted from a request by Eli Lilly, because of [...] "the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac". According to a 1994 article in Regardies magazine by journalist Patrick J. Kiger, Eli Lilly's public relations agency Hill & Knowlton, which is owned by the British conglomerate The WPP Group, was pressured by Eli Lilly to drop the Church of Scientology as a client just before the Time article was published. After the publication of the Time article, Miscavige stated that [...] "Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of Time magazine before it came out." [...] The Church filed a suit against Lilly, J. Walter Thompson, Hill and Knowlton and both agencies' parent group, WPP. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
2500|$|Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige {{appeared}} in his first ever interview with the media on the program Nightline on February 14, 1992, and was interviewed by Ted Koppel. Miscavige stated that he believed Scientology did not [...] "lend itself well to the press", and he criticized a piece on Scientology that aired <b>on</b> <b>Nightline</b> shortly before his interview. In his criticism of the piece, Miscavige asserted that Nightline correspondents had only interviewed members of CAN, stating, [...] "For instance, something that isn't mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there {{is part of a}} religious hate group called Cult Awareness Network and their sister group called American Family Foundation. Now, I don't know if you've heard of these people, but it's the same as the KKK would be with the blacks. I think if you interviewed a neo-Nazi and asked them to talk about the Jews, you would get a similar result to what you have here." [...] Koppel then posited the notion that others critical of Scientology were less apt to come forward and speak publicly due to fears of potential recrimination from the Church. In 1994, the Cult Awareness Network opened a counter-suit against the Church of Scientology, eleven individual Scientologists and the Los Angeles law firm of Bowles and Moxon.|$|E
