5|$|Qualification for the Games {{depended}} upon the performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> other major multi-sport events. Since these Games featured delegations from two continents, the qualification criteria for nations {{from the different}} continents was different. The qualification of the African nations was based on their performance in the 2003 All-Africa Games held in Abuja, Nigeria. The qualification for the Asian nations was based on their performance in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea.|$|E
5|$|The euro {{was founded}} on 1 January 1999, when it became the {{currency}} of over 300 million people in Europe. For {{the first three years}} of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountancy. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> eurozone 12, such as the Finnish markka.|$|E
5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981.

Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament {{if he or she is}} judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|As the war {{was ending}} in 1945, Silverman was on the road, {{traveling}} through all the countries of Central America, in South America, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa on fund-raising missions. Then in 1946, she was in Europe visiting refugee camps in Sweden and Occupied Germany, before returning to Palestine.

5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived. The hurricane's stable and well predicted path gave all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> the region ample {{time to prepare for}} its arrival. On August 17, {{at the request of the}} Quintana Roo state government, which was expecting their state to suffer a direct hit, the Civil Protection Office of Mexico's federal Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency for the entire state. This included the towns and cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Chetumal as well as the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Holbox.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{bilateral}} Minority Treaties, each signed between one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> {{question and the}} League. The treaties were signed between the League {{and some of the}} newly established nations: Poland, Yugoslavia (also known then as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), Czechoslovakia. Similar treaties were also imposed on Greece and Entente-allied Romania in exchange for their territorial enlargement, and on some of the nations defeated in the First World War (Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey). At the same time, Albania, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and, outside of Europe, Iraq were persuaded to accept minority obligations as part of the terms of their admission to the League of Nations.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of countries set up relief programs and most underwent {{some sort of}} political upheaval, pushing them to the right. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw them overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule, most famously in Germany in 1933.

Israeli television even erased the color signals using a device called the mekhikon.|$|E
25|$|Since Biblical times, {{music has}} held an {{important}} role in many Jews' lives. Jewish music has been influenced by surrounding Gentile traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time. Jewish musical contributions on the other hand tend to reflect the cultures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> which Jews live, the most notable examples being classical and popular music in the United States and Europe. However, other music is unique to particular Jewish communities, such as klezmer of Eastern Europe.|$|E

25|$|Collectively, {{the region}} {{is best known for}} {{producing}} and exporting oil. The oil industry significantly impacts the entire region, both through the wealth that it generates and through the movement of labor. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> the region have undertaken efforts to diversify their economies in recent years, however. In the report, Science-Metrix says the number of scientific publications listed in the Web of Science database shows that the standard growth in the Middle East, particularly in Iran and Turkey, is nearly four times faster than the world.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} the Protestant Reformation in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> which it took root was {{to bring an end}} to the long {{tradition}} of female convents which had existed within Roman Catholicism, and which the Reformers saw as bondage. By shutting down female convents within the movement, Protestantism effectively closed off the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women, as well as one which had provided some women a life in academic study. Among the many nuns who abandoned the monastic life was the wife of Martin Luther, Katherine von Bora.|$|E

Civil matters related to the community are dealt with by the Muslim Personal Law, and constitutional amendments in 1985 established its primacy in family matters.|$|E

25|$|The {{structural}} reform process {{that started in}} 1992 under the government of President Alberto Fujimori led to the privatization of the electricity sector in a decade in which most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> the region underwent a similar process. The restructuring process, articulated in the Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992, unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly into generation, transmission and distribution and led {{the basis for the}} introduction of private operators and competition for generation and commercialization, with transmission and distribution regulated on the basis of free entry and open access. The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997. The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet.|$|E
25|$|In 1619 his {{daughter}} died shortly after birth, {{the only child}} he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen {{the case of the}} Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> which they reside.|$|E
25|$|The {{ease with}} which an {{individual}} can acquire an amateur radio license varies from country to country. In some countries, examinations may be offered {{only once or twice}} a year in the national capital and can be inordinately bureaucratic (for example in India) or challenging because some amateurs must undergo difficult security approval (as in Iran). Currently only Yemen and North Korea do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens, although in both cases a limited number of foreign visitors have been permitted to obtain amateur licenses in the past decade. Some developing countries, especially those in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, require the payment of annual license fees that can be prohibitively expensive for most of their citizens. A few small countries may not have a national licensing process and may instead require prospective amateur radio operators to take the licensing examinations of a foreign country. In countries with the largest numbers of amateur radio licensees, such as Japan, the United States, Thailand, Canada, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> Europe, there are frequent license examinations opportunities in major cities.|$|E
