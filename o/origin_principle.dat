At the beginning of 2008, as the government was rethinking its orientation on immigration policy {{with the creation of}} the new ministry, the idea of a quota system was introduced as a possible alternative. In early 2008, a proposal was made to Parliament to decide each year how many immigrants to accept, based on skill and origin. However, this quota policy contradicts the French Constitution. A commission was formed in February 2008 to study how the Constitution could be changed to allow for a quota system.

However the international community still disagrees on the point whether the option of being placed in a permanent family setting through international adoption should prevail on the alternative of the placement of children in domestic care institutions. The United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2000) is an additional international instrument that calls on States parties to ensure that coercive adoption is criminalized under national law, regardless of whether the offence is committed domestically or transnationally, on an individual or organized basis.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} general consumption taxes levied under alternative tax principles. It is shown that different national tax rates imposed under a general destination principle or a general <b>origin</b> <b>principle</b> create no relative price distortions and no redistributional effects in a simple international trade model. Under mixed tax principles, nationally diverging tax rates are no longer neutral, however. Two such cases are studied: in the first setting, the destination principle applies to trade in intermediate goods while final consumer goods are taxed under the <b>origin</b> <b>principle.</b> In a second case (which has been termed a restricted <b>origin</b> <b>principle)</b> trade within an economic union {{is based on the}} <b>origin</b> <b>principle</b> while trade with third countries follows the destination principle. It is argued that the abolition of border controls in the European Community will inevitably lead to either the {{one or the other of}} these mixed principles for taxing international trade...|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{has long}} {{maintained}} an intention {{to move to}} the <b>origin</b> <b>principle</b> of taxation but no progress has been made since the com-pletion of the single market. The lack of progress seems surprising given the significant support for the <b>origin</b> <b>principle</b> in the economic literature. However, there is a contrast between the European Union that contains countries of widely different sizes and productivity levels and the theo-retical literature that has focussed on models with symmetrical countries. We extend the modelling of preferences over tax principles to incorporate asymmetries in efficiency and size. We show that disagreement among countries over tax principles can be sustained even with close economic integration. Large countries and inefficient countries are shown to prefer the <b>origin</b> <b>principle.</b> In contrast, small countries and efficient countries can have a preference for the destination principle. These results provide an insight into the political economy of the impasse in European Union tax policy...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} commodity tax competition on welfare and employment under the destination and origin principles, when the labor market is imperfectly competitive owing to a binding fixed wage. Our main finding is that commodity taxation causes an employment externality whose signs may be opposite under the two principles. While tax competition leads to inefficient tax rates under both principles, we also prove that the <b>origin</b> <b>principle</b> guarantees lower unemployment and higher welfare when the fixed wage is high. Finally, we show that the employment externality still exists in a standard union model of wage determination.
