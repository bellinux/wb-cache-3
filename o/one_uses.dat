5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if <b>one</b> <b>uses</b> the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything {{in his power to}} make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or other aspects of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural styles date to {{the last}} period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic. <b>One</b> <b>uses</b> well-carved stone blocks for construction and is possibly earlier than the second style, which is believed to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic and uses thin, flat stones.|$|E
5|$|The HTC <b>One</b> <b>uses</b> a 4.7 inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 {{touchscreen}} display with a {{pixel density}} of 468 ppi.

At {{the top of the}} device is a 0.14-inch (3.6mm) headphone jack and the power/lock key, which also functions as an infrared blaster. At the bottom is the primary microphone and a microUSB port for both data connections and charging; the device can stream HDMI via the microUSB port using MHL.|$|E

5|$|The heads-up display, which simulates {{the inside}} of Samus' helmet, {{features}} a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; <b>one</b> <b>uses</b> thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Metroid Prime introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old <b>one,</b> <b>uses</b> only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In round one, all 40 qualified athletes complete a single jump in the aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead {{based solely on the}} points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the leader has the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for round <b>one</b> <b>uses</b> the results from the first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – with athletes again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E

40|$|We present {{observation}} of electroweak single top quark production using 3. 2 fb − 1 of {{data collected by}} the CDF experiment. Candidate events are selected for further classification by five parallel analysis techniques: <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a likelihood discriminant, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a matrix-element discriminant, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> decision trees, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a neural network, and <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a complementary dataset. The results of these analyses are combined {{in order to improve}} the expected sensitivity. The signicance of the observed data is 5. 0 standard deviations, and the expected sensitivity is in excess of 5. 9 standard deviations.

5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, <b>one</b> <b>uses</b> a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
5|$|After they test {{negative}} for the virus, Artyom again encounters Khan. They locate the young Dark One, {{and in a}} series of hallucinatory flashbacks, Artyom recalls that he was saved by a Dark One as a child; he was psychically linked to the Dark Ones, intended to form a bridge between their species and his. Artyom vows to make amends by protecting the little Dark One, and the two travel to Polis, the Metro's central area, where a peace conference regarding D6 between the Rangers, Red Line, the Reich, and neutral Hansa is taking place. Artyom defeats Lesnitsky and Pavel during the trip. Along the way, the little Dark One senses that there is a group of hibernating Dark Ones in D6. After arriving at Polis, the little Dark <b>One</b> <b>uses</b> his telepathic abilities to make the Red Line leader, Chairman Moskvin, publicly confess that the peace conference is a diversion to enable General Korbut to seize D6. Artyom {{and the rest of the}} Rangers rush to the bunker to make a final stand against Korbut's army, but are incapacitated by an armored train ramming into their station. Red Line soldiers surround, and prepare to execute Artyom and Miller.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that <b>one</b> <b>uses</b> in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{performed}} three operations {{for each of}} the main data sources. First, we generated three prediction models using the training set, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> the linear regression method, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> the RPART method, and <b>one</b> <b>using</b> the NNR method. The three data sources have different data attributes and cannot be combined. Thus, we cannot use them together to develop a generic prediction model.|$|R

5|$|The HTC <b>One</b> <b>uses</b> a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
