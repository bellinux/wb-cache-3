25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E

25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E
25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone {{with knowledge of the}} records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main claims to unwind {{substantive}} transactions that could unjustly enrich some creditors' {{at the expense}} of others. First, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 declare every transaction void which is entered after the presentation of a winding up petition, unless approved by a court. In Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd Buckley LJ held that courts would habitually approve all contracts that were plainly beneficial to a company entered into in good faith in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> The predominant purpose of the provision is to ensure unsecured creditors are not prejudiced, and the company's assets are not unduly depleted. However, in Re Gray's Inn because a host of transactions honoured by the company's bank, in an overdrawn account, between the presentation and the winding up petition were being granted, this meant unprofitable trading. So, the deals were declared void. In Hollicourt (Contracts) Ltd v Bank of Ireland, the Court of Appeal held that a bank itself which allows overpayments will not be liable to secondarily creditors if transactions are subsequently declared void. It took the view that a bank is not unjustly enriched, despite any fees for its services the bank may receive. Second, under IA 1986 section 238, transactions at an undervalue may be avoided regardless of their purpose, but only up to two years before the onset of insolvency. For example, in Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd the liquidators of an insolvent company, AJ Bekhor Ltd, claimed rescind the transfer of assets to a subsidiary, whose shares were then purchased by the investment management house Brewin Dolphin for £1. The only other consideration given by Brewin Dolphin was the promise to carry out a lease agreement for computers, which itself was likely to be unwound and therefore worthless. The House of Lords held that the total package of connected transactions could be taken into account to decide whether a transaction was undervalued or not, and held that this one was.|$|E

40|$|News of the Court of Appeal’s {{unanimous}} {{decision on}} fixed and floating {{charges in the}} test case, National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Ltd & Ors, is now a little stale, but incredulity over the result persists. Few lawyers had correctly predicted the outcome. If Lord Phillips MR is right a bank’s charge will be fixed {{so long as the}} proceeds obtained by the debtor from any sale of the charged assets are paid into the debtor’s account with the lending bank. How the account is then operated is immaterial. In particular, the debtor is free to use the account in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> its <b>business,</b> subject only to any contractual restrictions the bank cares to impose. Put like this, the decision is astonishing. All the post-insolvency advantages of fixed security can be obtained without any of the pre-insolvency disadvantages: the debtor can sell the charged assets in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> its <b>business,</b> pay the proceeds to the bank, and then use the account at will; if the debtor defaults, the bank can realize its fixed security over the charged assets without a thought for statutory floating charge invalidity provisions, or for the claims of preferred or general unsecured creditors. For banks, the Court of Appeal decision suggests the floating charge has all but disappeared. If a bank wants a floating charge, perhaps for control rather than for financial security, it will need to take some rather odd steps to ensure that its security falls outside this new expanded class of fixed charges. This note respectfully suggests that the Court of Appeal decision is unsupportable, and that the case well merits the forthcoming appeal to the House of Lords...|$|R

Li's holding companies denied divesting in China, saying that its asset disposals were being undertaken in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> The attacks stopped abruptly several weeks later, when editorials in official publications such as People's Daily, Beijing Youth Daily took a neutral stance in unison.|$|E
2500|$|While both {{need to be}} registered, the {{distinction}} between a fixed and a floating charge matters greatly because floating charges are subordinated by the Insolvency Act 1986 to insolvency practitioners' expenses under section 176ZA, preferential creditors (employees' wages up to £800 per person, pension contributions and the EU coal and steel levies) under section 175 and Schedule 6 and unsecured creditors' claims up {{to a maximum of}} £600,000 under section 176A. The floating charge was invented as a form of security in the late nineteenth century, as a concept which would apply to the whole of the assets of an undertaking. The leading company law case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, exemplified that a floating charge holder (even if it was the director and almost sole shareholder of the company) could enforce their priority ahead of all other persons. As Lord MacNaghten said, [...] "Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is." [...] Parliament responded with the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after fixed charge holders, but before floating charge holders. In interpreting the scope of a floating charge the leading case was Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd where a receiver contended an instrument was void because it had not been registered. Romer LJ agreed, and held that the hallmarks of a floating charge were that (1) assets were charged present and future and (2) change in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> and most importantly (3) until a step is taken by the charge holder [...] "the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way". A floating charge is not, technically speaking, a true security until a date of its [...] "crystallisation", when it metaphorically descends and [...] "fixes" [...] onto the assets in a business' possession at that time.|$|E

2500|$|In National Westminster bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited {{and others}} [...] UKHL 41 the House of Lords finally brought some clarity {{to this area}} of the law. [...] The {{essential}} test of whether a charge was a fixed charge related to the chargor's power to continue to deal with the asset. [...] In order to preserve the status of a charge as a fixed one, the bank must exercise actual control over disposal of the asset. [...] If the chargor is able to deal with the asset, such as by drawing from the account in which charged funds are kept, or into which the proceeds of trade receivables are deposited, then the holder of the charge does not have effective control. [...] The judges held that as this is inconsistent with the status of the charge as fixed (if the chargor company is able to use the proceeds in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> its <b>business</b> without the consent of the charge holder), the charge could only take effect as a floating charge.|$|R
2500|$|Especially as {{automatic}} crystallisation {{ceased to}} make floating charges an effective form of priority, {{the next step}} by businesses was to contract for fixed charges over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd it {{was said to be}} done with a stipulation that the charge was [...] "fixed" [...] and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both. In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd, the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> any charge purported to be [...] "fixed" [...] over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition [...] "reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have." [...] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring). On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, {{in the same way as}} was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a growing {{awareness}} of the need to restore structures of historic significance on both national and local levels. Both Presidents Carter and Reagan have supported the adoption of extensive federal tax legislation which would provide owners of historic investment property with tax incentives to rehabilitate rather than to raze such property. Unfortunately, these tax enactments have not provided the type of incentive for rehabilitation which was desired. Today in Congress, there is a growing school of thought that the current tax provisions foster the promotion of abusive tax shelters which allow investors to obtain tax benefits greater than their investments warrant. Some members of Congress feel that these provisions should be limited, if not eliminated, in their application to historic rehabilitation property. In both the House and the Senate, legislation has been introduced to try to cut tax incentives of this sort. This Note explores the possible ramifications of such legislation on the incentives to rehabilitate historic property, refutes the contention that such incentives promote abusive tax shelters in the area of historic rehabilitation, and advocates the extension of such incentives to individual taxpayers beyond those who hold historic buildings for use in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> their <b>business</b> or as income producing property by enacting new legislation similar to the Residential Energy Credit.
