5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail, {{scientific}} name Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, is {{a species of}} small air-breathing land snail in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. This species was discovered in 1905, and was reported three years later as a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> ambersnail, Succinea ovalis. Several taxonomic reviews {{took place in the}} subsequent decades {{until the end of the}} 1980s, when the Chittenango ovate amber snail was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, based on chemical and morphological data.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{church in}} Bristol is St James' Priory in Horsefair, Whitson Street. It {{was founded in}} 1129, as a Benedictine priory, by Robert Rufus.

Either just before or just after the disappearance of the Templars, the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church.|$|E

5|$|Three {{long-lived}} anticyclonic features termed white ovals {{were observed}} in 1938.

5|$|Lower Princes Street rises {{slightly}} from the Exchange before dropping down, becoming flat for the final kilometre of its length.

The street itself widens from thee crest below the Exchange, becoming a dual carriageway from this point south to the major junction at the southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval.</b> Several notable buildings are still found in the lower Princes Street area, among them the former H.E. Shacklock building and the Crown Roller Mills Building; the latter in particular is a notable landmark.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
25|$|The famous gasholders {{just outside}} the ground were built around 1853.

30|$|Accurate mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval</b> into <b>the</b> {{equatorial}} plane {{is critical for}} <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> aurora and substorm dynamics. Comparison of ion pressure values measured at low altitudes by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites during their crossings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval,</b> with plasma pressure values obtained at the {{equatorial plane}} from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite measurements, indicates that <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval</b> maps into <b>the</b> equatorial plane at distances between 6 and 12 Earth radii. On the nightside, this region is {{generally considered to be}} a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasma sheet. However, our studies suggest that this region could form part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasma ring surrounding the Earth. We discuss <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> results found here to explain <b>the</b> ring-like shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval,</b> <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injection boundary inside the magnetosphere near the geostationary orbit, presence of quiet auroral arcs in <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval</b> despite <b>the</b> constantly high level of turbulence observed in the plasma sheet, and some features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> substorm expansion.|$|R
5|$|In the {{background}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> shield is the mountain Chimborazo, while the river originating from its base represents the Guayas. Chimborazo {{is also the}} highest mountain in Ecuador and {{is part of the}} Andes Range. The steamboat on the river is named Guayas as well. The ship was built in Guayaquil and was the first seaworthy steamship built in both Ecuador and in all of South America. It was first put into service on 9 October 1841. The ship has the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it. On top a golden sun surrounded by the Zodiac astrological signs for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the March Revolution of 1845 that ousted General Juan José Flores.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E

In the middle layer, a PD facilitator helps a teacher to learn ways of helping students learn the content in the classroom. In the third layer, a researcher/program designer works with the PD facilitators to help them to learn how to help teachers to help students to learn.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{work has}} shown that solar wind dynamic {{pressure}} changes can have a dramatic effect on the particle precipitation in the high-latitude ionosphere. It has also been noted that the preexisting interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation can significantly affect the resulting changes in the size, location, and intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval.</b> Here we focus on <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> pressure pulses on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auroral <b>oval.</b> We use particle precipitation data from up to four Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft and simultaneous POLAR Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) images to examine three events of solar wind pressure fronts impacting the magnetosphere under two IMF orientations, IMF strongly southward and IMF Bz nearly zero before the pressure jump. We show that <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> change in <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> and polar cap sizes and the local time extent of th...|$|R
