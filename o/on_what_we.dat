5|$|During series two, the Torchwood website, www.torchwood.org.uk also hosted an {{interactive}} online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Updated weekly with the airing {{of the new}} episodes, the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David-Lloyd in character as Ianto debriefing and informing the 'player' with regards to their mission. Throughout both series one and two, the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form, along with new original material, some of which expands <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know of Ianto. For example, it introduces his sister, Rhiannon and brother-in-law Johnny; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009's third televised series.|$|E

25|$|As in The Age of Intelligent Machines Kurzweil argues {{here that}} {{evolution}} has an intelligence quotient just slightly greater than zero. He {{says it is}} not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence {{is a function of}} time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals.|$|E

According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|In {{advanced}} modeling, {{with the}} requisite computational support such as knowledge-based engineering, mappings {{must be maintained}} between a real-world object, its abstracted counterparts {{as defined by the}} domain and its experts, and the computer models. Mismatches between domain models and their computational mirrors can raise issues that are apropos to this topic. Techniques that allow the flexible modeling required for many hard problems must resolve issues of identity, type, etc. which then lead to methods, such as duck typing. Many domains, with a numerics focus, use limit theory, of various sorts, to overcome the duck test necessity with varying degrees of success. Yet, with that, issues still remain as representational frameworks bear heavily <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can know.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

500|$|There was {{widespread}} speculation {{on the nature}} of the UK's relationship with the US under Brown's government. Brown's close aide Douglas Alexander said in a Washington D.C speech, [...] "In the 21st century, strength should be measured <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can build together...we need to demonstrate by our deeds, words and our actions that we are internationalist, not isolationist, multilateralist, not unilateralist, active and not passive, and driven by core values, consistently applied, not special interests".

500|$|Moralistic {{judgments}} implying wrongness or badness on {{the part}} of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (Moralistic judgments are {{not to be confused with}} value judgments as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that [...] "Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> and others need and are not getting." ...|$|E

She is an avid supporter of charities, and stood as a trustee of a British charity helping those with alcohol and substance abuse issues (at the time called The Chemical Dependency Centre and later renamed Action on Addiction in 2007). She also supported the Lavender Trust at Breast Cancer Care and The Elton John AIDS Foundation. Criticised for being [...] "too skinny", she responded: [...] "I've been nine stone for 20 years, I always eat what I want, it's not an issue for me.

500|$|Nolan's work explores existential, {{ethical and}} {{epistemological}} themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, {{the nature of}} time, causality and construction of personal identity. [...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one {{of the ways in which}} we try to see things from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. [...] "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We tend to focus <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can control {{and not worry about}} what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E

And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man.

500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
