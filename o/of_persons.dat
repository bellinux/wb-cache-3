5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E

This study used event related potentials to investigate {{the time course of}} integrating the newly constructed meaning <b>of</b> <b>person</b> names into discourse context. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>person</b> names was built by two-sentence descriptions of the names. Then we manipulated the congruence <b>of</b> <b>person</b> names relative to discourse context {{in a way that the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>person</b> names either matched or did not match the previous context. ERPs elicited by the names were compared between the congruent and the incongruent conditions. We found that the incongruent names elicited a larger N 400 as well as a larger P 600 compared to the congruent names. The results suggest that the meaning of unknown names can be effectively constructed from short linguistic descriptions and that the established meaning can be rapidly retrieved and integrated into contexts...|$|R

40|$|This thesis will {{construct}} a model <b>of</b> <b>person</b> through {{a comparison of}} ideas relating to a concept <b>of</b> <b>person</b> in the Byzantine and Pratyabhijnii traditions. Questions will be asked, such as, whether a concept <b>of</b> <b>person</b> can be constructed within these two traditions, and how can ideas developed from these traditions be utilised to {{construct a}} model <b>of</b> <b>person?</b> This thesis will provide an in depth examination of terms and concepts that will be related to a concept <b>of</b> <b>person</b> within the two traditions, examining the ontological and existential implications of those terms. This work will also develop, from a subsequent convergence of the theologies of the two traditions, a model <b>of</b> <b>person</b> that is inter-religious and dialogical. Though this work is analytical in nature, in its deconstructing philosophical and theological models relating to person, it is also constructive, taking what is useful from the Byzantine and Pratyabhijnii traditions so as to construct a new model <b>of</b> <b>person</b> {{through the development of}} the term, Atman-hypostasis which looks to understanding human personhood in the fullest mystical state (deification) within the human condition. A comparison of the two traditions has not been attempted before in relation to the theological discourse of person; neither has such an extensive examination and deconstruction <b>of</b> the concept <b>person</b> in Byzantine and Pratyabhijnii traditions been undertaken in relation to contemporary studies; neither has a construction of this type <b>of</b> model <b>of</b> <b>person</b> been undertaken. This work, in constructing a new term Atmanhypostasis, which emerged from this research as an outcome of the comparison of terms and ideas relating to a concept <b>of</b> <b>person</b> in both traditions, will contribute to the academic theological field of personhood and this thesis will also contribute to the field of inter-religious dialogue in developing an anthropological model that aims to overcome the barriers that separate and divide.
