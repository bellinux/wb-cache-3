For example, the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon <b>or</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>oxide</b> to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, {{and most of these}} compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides [...] contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the [...] anion, isoeelctronic with white phosphorus, P4. Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e.g. Cu5Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e.g. U3Si2) or four silicon atoms (e.g. 44−) at first, followed by chains (e.g. CaSi), layers (e.g. CaSi2), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e.g. α-ThSi2) as the silicon content rises even higher.|$|E

A broad luminescence band is observed in the red region, in which the time evolution exhibits a stretched exponential decay. With increasing excitation intensity a significant saturation effect is observed. Direct electron-hole recombination is the dominant effect in the red band. A relatively narrow peak appears around 1. 5 eV, which is attributed to the interface states overlapping with transition from the ground state of the silicon QDs. The saturation factor increases slowly with detection photon energy between 1. 5 and 1. 8 eV, which is attributed to the emission from zerophonon electron-hole recombination.

The {{debate about}} the {{conductivity}} of DNA have been recently revived due to contradictory results of transport measurements on {{a small number of}} molecules deposited on a substrate and connected to metallic electrodes, and an answer to this question is important for DNA based molecular electronics.

However in other works DNA was found to be insulating [4], even when the molecules had perfectly ordered base pairs.

At first we consider the global defect of the DNAs structure due to the interaction of the molecules with the underlying substrate.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at flat metal surfaces cannot be directly excited by free-space lights due to momentum mismatch. Here we propose a way to resonantly excite SPPs by lights without using any coupler and propose a kind of surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) system which can be simply composed by a metal film and a bottom medium whose real part of permittivity is less than unity. A light, which is incident from vacuum or air to the upper surface of the metal film, can directly excite a SPP at the lower surface of the metal film. Some special media can be selected as the bottom medium, including atomic vapor of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and some special solid media. In the atomic EIT case, the steep dispersion at the transparent window can lead to interesting phenomena; e. g., very slow directional moving of the EIT atoms can lead to unidirectional SPPs (reverse-propagating SPP modes do not exist) and therefore lead to a highly asymmetric SPR angle spectrum which is very sensitive to the velocity of the atoms.
