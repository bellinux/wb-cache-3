5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} {{smoking and}} air pollution, {{is the primary}} method <b>of</b> <b>prevention.</b> Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> are hand washing; not {{touching}} the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{to prevent}} {{certain types of}} {{pneumonia}} are available. Other methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.

Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and caffeine would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. In the years since, research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis on}} the subject of "The Issue of Realisation <b>of</b> Primary <b>Prevention</b> at Secondary Schools" {{discusses}} primary prevention and the issue of high-risk behaviour by students. This work contains a theoretical and practical section. The theoretical section describes high-risk behaviour by students, focusing on primary prevention and its effectiveness and organisational assurance <b>of</b> primary <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> high-risk behaviour in the Czech Republic. The practical section examines realisation <b>of</b> primary <b>prevention</b> in secondary school programmes. Research focused on primary <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> high-risk behaviour by students at secondary schools. The goal was to investigate realisation <b>of</b> precautionary <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> high-risk behaviour and examine the effectiveness of preventive programmes at selected secondary schools in the South Bohemian Region. We chose a qualitative approach, the method of obtaining data by means of interviews with school prevention methodologists at secondary schools. We can state that the issue <b>of</b> primary <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> high-risk behaviour is an extensive and sensitive subject, in which the school plays an important role. The purpose <b>of</b> primary <b>prevention</b> is to endeavour to make healthy life style activities a part of the education process...|$|R

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods <b>of</b> <b>prevention.</b> Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased pressures of oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} method <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> {{is to make}} paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or {{to remove}} it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of the prevailing wind. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development <b>of</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E
