40|$|The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} and effective protocols in the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). It is also one of the few MANET protocols whose routing scheme can easily be optimized. But the routing overhead generated by its routing algorithm still leaves substantial amounts of energy being wasted. Route Request (RREQ) and Route Maintenance packets generate overhead control packets that <b>occupy</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> consume energy and may overwhelm a network if not controlled. This paper proposed EEDSR, an extension of DSR that reduces routing overhead by limiting the number of route discovery and maintenance packets in the MANET. The scheme involves bigger packet headers for the source route discovery packets since they contain information about the energy levels of the nodes in the route cache. In EEDSR, since the RREQ packets are flooded once for each communication period, routing overhead is minimized...|$|R

We analyzed the technique criteria of the 4 G wireless communication system in this paper which is based on that of WiBro System.
