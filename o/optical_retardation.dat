However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a Prince Rupert's drop. In a further study published in 2017 The team collaborated with Dr. Hillar Aben, a professor at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia using a transmission polariscope to measure the <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> of light from a red LED as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to , but that this surface compressive layer is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means {{that it is necessary to}} create a crack that enters the interior tension zone in order to break the droplet. As cracks on the surface tend to grow parallel to the surface, they cannot enter the tension zone but a disturbance in the tail allows cracks to enter the tension zone.|$|E

However, the detailed characterization of skin collagen fibers using optical anisotropy methods remains elusive. A clear understanding of collagen fiber organization in skin tissues may be important {{in the interpretation of}} their structural-functional relationships under normal and pathological conditions. In this study, fiber orientation in collagen bundles (CBs) and their supramolecular organization were examined in rat skin using polarization microscopy and image analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Image variations with rotation of the microscope stage and selection of the in-depth focus plane were investigated in unstained sections of varying thicknesses from rat skin fragments. Total birefringence (image analysis) and form and intrinsic birefringence (Sénarmont’s method) were estimated. Based on the birefringent images, CBs were found to contain intercrossing points with a twisted helical distribution of collagen fibers (chiral elements) and frequently presented circular structures. Collagen fibers were observed to extend from the surface level to deeper planes, creating a 3 D-network of oriented intertwined CBs. At least three levels of birefringent brilliance intensity were revealed by image analysis, indicating a heterogeneous spatial organization of the CBs.

During the period of 70 hours to 11 days of incubation (Hamburger-Hamilton stages 19 to 37) average cell mass increased more than 4. 5 times while cells changed from relatively undifferentiated neuroblasts to morphologically characteristic nerve cells with long processes. By making simplifying assumptions about thickness of nucleus and nucleolus, relative to cytoplasmic thickness, {{it was possible to}} calculate solute concentration of nucleus and nucleolus relative to that of the cytoplasm from measurements of <b>optical</b> <b>retardations</b> through living cells. Differences in relative solute concentration were observed in nucleolus, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm in the approximate ratio 1. 2 : 1. 0 : 0. 8, respectively. The ratio remained essentially constant during the growth period examined {{despite the fact that the}} cell components grow at markedly different rates. This suggests that solid concentrations are physical characteristics of nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm which are maintained even during rapid growth and differentiation. By cytochemical means it was demonstrated that mass increase in the nucleus is not associated with increase in deoxyribonucleic acid. Both ribonucleic acid and protein are in greater concentration in nucleolus and cytoplasm than in the nucleoplasm. Electron microscopy shows interruptions in the nuclear envelope as well as an approximately even distribution of electron density in nucleus and cytoplasm.

40|$|Summary Objective: To analyze {{morphological}} {{characteristics and}} organization of the collagen fibers of third degree burns from scalding compared to laser therapy and silver sulfadiazine, the latter considered as the gold standard. Method: Were selected 12 animals (Rattus norvegicus) also divided into three groups (control group [CG] - untreated burns; sulfadiazine group [SG] - burns were treated with silver sulfadiazine at 1 %; laser group [LG] - burns were treated with photobiomodulation). The scald burns were carried out by using PVC mold, and the material collected on the 14 th day after burn was prepared for morphological and <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> analysis for evaluation of inflammatory infiltrates and collagen organization, respectively. Results: On the 14 th day, the laser and sulfadiazine groups had mild inflammatory response, while the control group showed an intense inflammatory process, with statistical significance between laser and control groups, but not between sulfadiazine and control groups. Laser and sulfadiazine groups no longer had granulation tissue, opposite to what {{was seen in the}} control group. The presence of hair follicles and ulcer did not significantly differ between groups. The <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> of collagen fibers was higher in sulfadiazine group, followed by laser and control groups.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how {{a combination of}} microspectroscopy and interference microscopy {{has been used to}} investigate the composition of the cytoplasm of fresh ascites tumour cells of mice. The accuracy of the microspectroscopic method will be very dependent on the standard absorption curves used (i. e. results obtained from dilute nucleic acid and protein solutions of known concentration), and particular attention has therefore been given to this aspect of the investigation. Thus, the stan-dard protein absorption curve has been derived in two ways, first from a certain assumed amino-acid composition, and secondly by a method involving the optical density and refractive index of the ascitic fluid itself. Both methods are shown to result in similar cellular analyses. The cytoplasm of the ascites cell can be divided broadly into two regions—a granular zone of comparatively low ultra-violet absorption, and a peripheral region possessing greater absorption, but with little structure visible by the optical microscope. Absorption measurements at 257 and 275 mfj, show that, despite the difference in ribonucleic acid content in these two regions, the protein concentrations are approxi-mately the same. For comparison with these microspectroscopic results, <b>optical</b> <b>retardations</b> have been measured in the identical regions of the same ascites cells. Total dry mass con-centrations, evaluated interferometrically, were found to be in good agreement with the sum of the nucleic acid and protein weights, these being obtained from the ultra-violet results. This indicates that the ultra-violet absorption of the cytoplasm of the fresh ascites cell is not grossly different from that to be expected from its extracted nucleic acid and protein components. It is stressed that the material used in this in-vestigation was in many ways suitable for quantitative absorption measurements and equally consistent results should not be expected from all other types of cells, parti-cularly those measured after fixation rather than in a fresh condition...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relation}} between a three-dimensional {{state of strain}} and the <b>optical</b> phase <b>retardation</b> in a single mode optical fiber is formalized by drawing together classical three-dimensional crystal optics and classical waveguide theory. Neumann’s strain optic relations are described in a form usable in optical fiber sensor design. These relations are then combined with weakly guiding fiber theory to develop an integral which relates the optical phase shift in a structurally embedded interferometric optical fiber strain sensor to the induced three-dimensional strain field. This process leads to a previously undisclosed, additional waveguide dispersion term which contributes on the same order to the total strain induced phase retardation as does the term derived by Butter and Hocker (1978). Still, however, waveguide dispersion effects {{are found to be}} negligibly small, even in three-dimensional loading. Butter and Hocker’s equation and the complete phase-strain model developed herein can give very similar results when both are applied to certain embedded sensors. This anomaly can lead to the false conclusion that Butter and Hocker’s results are equally valid for any structurally embedded sensor...|$|R
40|$|The working {{principle}} of ordinary refractive lenses {{can be explained}} in terms of the space-variant <b>optical</b> phase <b>retardations</b> they introduce, which reshape the optical wavefront curvature and hence affect the subsequent light propagation. These phases, in turn, are due to the varying optical path length seen by light at different transverse positions relative to the lens centre. A similar lensing behavior can however be obtained when the optical phases are introduced by an entirely different mechanism. Here, we consider the "geometric phases" that arise from the polarization transformations occurring in anisotropic optical media, named after Pancharatnam and Berry. The medium anisotropy axis is taken to be space-variant in the transverse plane and the resulting varying geometric phases give rise to the wavefront reshaping and lensing effect, which however depends also on the input polarization. We describe the realization and characterization of a cylindrical geometric-phase lens that is converging for a given input circular polarization state and diverging for the orthogonal one, which provides one of the simplest possible examples of optical element based on geometric phases. The demonstrated lens is flat and only few microns thick (not including the supporting substrates); moreover, its working wavelength can be tuned and the lensing can be switched on and off by the action of an external control electric field. Other kinds of lenses or more general phase elements inducing different wavefront distortions can be obtained by a similar approach. Besides their potential for optoelectronic technology, these devices offer good opportunities for introducing college-level students to an advanced topic of modern physics, such as the Berry phase, with the help of interesting optical demonstrations.

The exact arrangement of stromal collagen is currently unknown but several structural models have been proposed. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to investigate inconsistencies between current x‐ray derived structural models of the cornea and optically derived birefringence data. Firstly, the thesis reviews the current understanding of corneal structure, particularly in relation to corneal birefringence. It also reviews and develops the different analytical approaches used to model optical biaxial behaviour, particularly as applied to predict corneal <b>optical</b> phase <b>retardation.</b> The second part develops a novel technique of elliptic polarization biomicroscopy (EPB), enabling study of corneal birefringence in vivo. Using EPB, the pattern of corneal retardation is recorded for a range of human subjects. This dataset is then used to investigate both central and peripheral corneal birefringence as well as the corneal microstructure. A key finding is that the central parts of the cornea exhibit a retardation pattern compatible with a negative biaxial crystal, whereas the peripheral corneal regions do not. Furthermore, within the central regions of the cornea, orthogonal confocal conic fibrillar structures are identified which resemble the analytically derived contours of equal refractive index of an ideal negative biaxial crystal. The third part of this work presents a synthesis of previous published experimental, anatomical and theoretical findings and the experimental results presented in this thesis. Based on these findings, a novel corneal structural model is proposed that comprises overlapping spherical elliptic structural units.

Design 10 - and 44 -week-old guinea-pigs were accustomed to treadmill running for 3 weeks. Thereafter the animals ran 2500 m/day, 5 days a week, for 15 weeks. Articular cartilage specimens from knee joints were collected at 28 and 62 weeks. Osteoarthritis (OA) prevalence and severity was evaluated by aid of light microscopy. The degree of collagen fibril network organization and content was analyzed with quantitative polarized light microscopy. The local concentration of GAGs was determined from cartilage sections with digital densitometry after safranin-O staining. Results In the young guinea-pigs, running increased up to 24 % the <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> of polarized light by collagen in the superficial articular cartilage of femur, indicating either {{a higher degree of}} fibril assembly and organization or increased amount of collagen, or both. In contrast, in the adult mature animals the <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> decreased almost 50 % after joint loading (P< 0. 01 – 0. 001). Running did not increase cartilage fibrillation. Significant changes in GAG content of cartilage were not found either in the young or adult mature runners. Conclusions Increased birefringence of the superficial articular cartilage after joint loading in young guinea-pigs can be interpreted to be a sign of improved and decreased birefringence in older animals a sign of worsened property of the collagen network. It can be suggested therefore that joint loading strengthened the collagen network in the young runners. It can be hypothesized further that with time the inferior property of the collagen network predisposes the older runners to earlier OA than in controls...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{investigate}} the topographical variations among the morphological and physical properties of articular cartilage over a canine humeral head. Design Nine side-by-side specimens from a canine humeral head {{were used in}} the combined polarized light microscopy (PLM) and microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (μMRI). Sixteen images were acquired from each specimen in μMRI. Subsequently, ten to fourteen histological slices were prepared at the location of the μMRI slice from each specimen. Four optical images were acquired from each histological slice. Using these images, the images of the T 2 relaxation, the <b>optical</b> <b>retardation,</b> and the collagen-fiber orientation were constructed in two dimensions. Results Along the medial/lateral direction of the humeral head, we have observed a number of topographical variations. These include the total thickness of the cartilage tissue, the thickness of the individual histological zones, the depth of the minimum <b>optical</b> <b>retardation</b> in the tissue, and the depth of the maximum T 2 relaxation in the tissue. We found that the depth of the minimum retardation from PLM occurs at the geometric middle point of the transitional zone in histology, and that the depth of the maximum T 2 relaxation from μMRI is closely correlated with the minimum retardation depth in PLM. In addition, although the thickness of the total tissue increases approximately by the same amount on both the lateral and medial sides of the joint, a slight asymmetry exists between the measurements from the medial and lateral halves of the humerus. Conclusions Cartilage from different sites over a single joint could have different properties, possibly the consequence of the variation in load-bearing status. Because of these topographical variations, one must keep in mind that a different sampling site within a relatively small area of the same joint may significantly influence the results of the study.

40|$|The Nilella {{intermodal}} cell {{is formed}} by {{a division of}} the segment cell, the latter being a direct derivative of the shoot apical cell. The internodal cell is remarkable in that it elongates from an initial length of about 20 microns to a mature length of about 60 millimeters. The structures of the apical and segment cells, and the internodal cells in all stages of development were examined with the techniques of interference, polarization, and electron microscopy. The apical and segment cells were found to be isotropic. The upper part of the segment cell, destined to form a node, shows a curious pitted structure that was characteristic of certain node structures. The lower part of the segment cell, destined to become an internodal cell, shows a vague transverse arrangement of fibrils at the inner wall surface. The internodal cells, from the time they are first formed, show negative birefringence and a transverse arrangement of microfibrils at the inner wall surface. The elongation of the internodal cell is characterized by a rise, dip, and rise in both the <b>optical</b> thickness and <b>retardation</b> of the cell wall. The dip in both these variables coincides with the attainment of the maximum relative elongation rate. After the cessation of elongation, wall deposition continues, but the fibrils at. the inner surface of the wall are now seen to occur in fields of nearly parallel microfibrils. These fields, with varying fibrillar directions, may partly overlap each other or may merge with one another. Unlike the growing wall, this wall which is deposited after the end of elongation is isotropic...|$|R
40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are optical fiber Fabry-Perot (FP) sensors and side-polished fibers. By vacuum deposition, {{aluminum}} films are formed directly onto the single mode fibers to serve as mirrors. FP cavities with Al mirrors {{are used in the}} experimental investigations. Typical finesse is about 4. However, finesse as high as 14 has been achieved. The transfer functions and polarization characteristics of single-mode fiber FP cavities are studied. To use optical fiber FP cavities as temperature and stress sensors, ways must be found to discern the direction of the change of the optical path length. Such a scheme has been developed and demonstrated. Theoretical study also shows two polarization modes are supported by FP cavities containing birefringent fibers, and the retardation between two polarization modes is varied when the fiber is stressed laterally. Taking advantage of the stress dependent <b>retardation,</b> <b>optical</b> fiber polarimetric sensors without using analyzers are proposed and demonstrated. The theoretical results are confirmed with the experimental investigations. ^ The main objectives of side-polished fiber research are to develop techniques to form and to characterize low-loss side polished single mode fibers. Theoretical calculations show that the polished surface has to be within 12 to 2 μm of the core if significant interaction with the fields guided by a single-mode fiber is desired. The study also reveals that the polishing depth must be determined accurately to within fractions of a micron for most applications. Therefore, stringent dimensional control is necessary if the polishing is to be successful. In this thesis, a reliable technique of fabricating side-polished fibers is established. Single mode fibers are embedded in the V grooves of silicon wafers and polished with 0. 05 μm colloidal silica slurries. A nondestructive method to estimate the polishing depth has been demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|The Oral Communication {{consider}} to be a Social activity and indispensable essential part of individual daily life, those who have oral communication skill, wide scopes of cognition will be open to them in future, it also achieve many gains in the scope of social relations. due to lacks of oral communications, many of rights has been wasted, many of decisions has been issued by mistake and many of cognition chances get lost. One of the barriers that influence on the One's ability of oral communication is : One's tact and his fluency of the language,traditions, believes and physiological barriers like <b>optical</b> and audible <b>retardation</b> For fulfilling current research goals, it requires to use two tools they are: Tool to measure the Oral communication apprehension, researcher adopted the standard of (McCroskey, 1985), researcher also adopted the two identification (Skyrim, 1997),(Hilal 2014) to construct the standard of cognition management, after that the researcher verified of verity and invariance of the two standards, it has been applied on research sample that comprise (375) both gender students of Babylon university, after the collection of the data and analyzed it statically the correlation coefficient of (Pearson) has been used in addition to (T-test) for two independent samples and (Z) test for one sample, and analysis the bilateral variance. In the light of the results, the researcher set a number of suggestions they are:- 1 -Deliberating the Oral communication apprehension and its relevant to Cognition management for the other study stages. 2 -Deliberating the Oral communication apprehension and its relevant to self- Confidence for the university students. 3 -Deliberating the pertinence between Oral communication apprehension and another variables like creationism, academic Attainment and social anxiety communication...|$|R
