5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling <b>our</b> <b>differences</b> with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E

If I shout and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it.

500|$|After {{nearly a}} year of legal battles, Thirty Seconds To Mars {{announced}} on April 28, 2009, that the suit had been settled. The suit was resolved following a defence based on a contract case involving actress Olivia de Havilland decades before. Jared Leto explained, [...] "The California Appeals Court ruled that no service contract in California is valid after seven years, and it {{became known as the}} De Havilland Law after she used it to get out of her contract with Warner Bros." [...] Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI. Leto said that the band had [...] "resolved <b>our</b> <b>differences</b> with EMI" [...] and the decision had been made because of [...] "the willingness and enthusiasm by EMI to address our major concerns and issues, [...] the opportunity to return to work with a team so committed and passionate about Thirty Seconds to Mars." [...] After the suit's resolution, Nick Gatfield, EMI Music's president of A labels for North America and the United Kingdom, stated, [...] "We are thrilled to have set aside <b>our</b> <b>differences</b> and signed a new agreement with Thirty Seconds to Mars. Our relationship has been extremely rewarding and successful, and we're eager to move forward and put our global team to work." ...|$|E

She described what her album is about {{and then she}} sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened <b>our</b> <b>differences</b> out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E

500|$|A Child of Our Time {{has survived}} periods of indifference, {{particularly}} in America, to be ranked alongside Britten's War Requiem {{as one of}} the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period. According to Meirion Bowen, Tippett's long-time companion and a champion of his music, the work's particular quality is its universal message, with which audiences all over the world have identified. In his notes accompanying the performance at the 2010 Grant Park Music Festival in Chicago, Richard E. Rodda summarises the work's continuing appeal: [...] "t deals with issues as timeless as civilization itself—man's inhumanity to man, the place of the individual who confronts ruthless power ... the need for learning the lessons of history and for compassion and understanding and honesty and equality in our dealings with each other, whatever <b>our</b> <b>differences</b> may be. Tippett's Child still speaks profoundly to us in our own deeply troubled time".|$|E

5000|$|Comparing {{ourselves}} to others is something humans {{do all the}} time.

Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in the ways we are different from one another and differences in the ways we are the same.
