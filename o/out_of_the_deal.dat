5|$|In January 1960 McClory visited Fleming's Jamaican home Goldeneye, where Fleming {{explained}} his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation {{from him and}} Bryce that McClory act as producer. Additionally, Fleming told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell his services to MCA, back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal,</b> or file suit in court.|$|E
5|$|As part of Sarakreek's 1997 {{purchase}} {{of most of}} the L'Enfant Plaza complex, Sarakreek put the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel up for sale. Stanford Hotels Corporation, a privately owned firm, successfully bid $48 million for the structure. After a definitive sale agreement was reached in 1998, Sarakreek backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal.</b> Hotels Stanford sued in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates (CAB-1413-99, 1999), Superior Court Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract. Stanford Hotels appealed. Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the January {{transfer}} window came, Eriksson had decided to sell Samaras, amongst others, to try and raise funds for the club. Birmingham City had chased him for several weeks and had a £2.5million offer accepted, meeting Manchester City's valuation of the player, but they pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> with a week of the transfer window remaining. Several teams including Rangers, Middlesbrough, Espanyol, Bolton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic had {{expressed an interest in}} signing him, but it was Celtic to whom he eventually moved.|$|E
2500|$|The Trump Organization {{initially}} {{entered into}} contracts with chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian to open {{restaurants in the}} atrium and in <b>the</b> northwest corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Organization's planned new hotel.

[...] The ensuing legal disputes were settled in April 2017.|$|R

In 2006, Phoenix Equity Partners led a {{secondary}} buy <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business. <b>The</b> <b>deal</b> provided an exit for {{private equity firm}} Dunedin Capital Partners.

5|$|NeXT {{withdrew from}} the {{hardware}} business in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon. Canon later pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal.</b> Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of Sun Microsystems Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create OpenStep which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{followed}} the disappointment of For Your Eyes Only with Thunderball, the novelization {{of a film}} script on which he had worked with others. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script. In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the newly formed team, and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script. Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer. He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal,</b> or file a suit in court.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Dey {{retired after}} selling his {{ownership}} interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn. Ahearn and Gorman had an uneasy partnership {{and at one}} point Gorman was going to buy out Ahearn. By January 1925, the deal was nearly finalized when Gorman backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal.</b> Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the Connaught Park Racetrack and Gorman moved on to New York to manage the New York Americans. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a share issue. William Foran, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the Club. As the Auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.|$|E
50|$|The Kushners later pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>deal.</b> In October 2012, the Landmarks Preservation Commission {{created the}} East Village/Lower East Side Historic District, which included in its boundaries the Meserich Synagogue.|$|R

5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from {{sales of the}} Daily News began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal,</b> apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the Daily News was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no better luck {{than anyone else in}} reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & Daily News (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all Daily News employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the Daily News ceased.|$|E

Paul helps rebuild the complex and reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud.

5000|$|The article {{claimed that}} the Dragons either pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deals</b> over minor technicalities, {{deliberately}} offered heavily unfavourable terms to the entrepreneurs {{in an effort to}} make them withdraw, or simply broke off all contact with them after the recording. The Dragons however defended their record, blaming the failures on the entrepreneurs themselves who were dishonest about their products, with Duncan Bannatyne stating: [...] "We don't hand over money to people who don't tell the truth.", while Theo Paphitis added: [...] "I kept up my end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bargain. The show is not about a cash prize, it is about us pledging to invest. But people must tell the truth. Simple." ...|$|R
5|$|Irvine {{is married}} to wife Rita, whom he met in a public house in Burnley. The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. He {{has lived in the}} village of Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a do-it-yourself retail business in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal.</b> Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered severe depression and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a window cleaner for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E

25|$|Among {{acquisitions}} made {{outside the}} newspaper industry, Bell led {{a group that}} attempted {{to gain control of}} the Hudson's Bay Company in 1950.

It was later suggested that Bell backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deal</b> in the belief that the company would struggle to adapt to his ideas. By 1965, Bell was the largest single shareholder in Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).|$|E
