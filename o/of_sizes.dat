40|$|The {{development}} of the perception <b>of</b> <b>size</b> is currently interpreted as the development <b>of</b> <b>size</b> constancy. Using data from prior studies, this paper reports a functional measurement analysis <b>of</b> the perceived <b>size</b> <b>of</b> rectangles located on a frontal plane. Analysis shows the {{development of}} the perception <b>of</b> <b>size</b> may depend on what can be called the development <b>of</b> <b>size</b> isomorphism. While size constancy may change during childhood with the ability to use cues <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and distance, it is proposed that the extent <b>of</b> <b>size</b> isomorphism may change with age given change with age in the neural representation of perceived length and in the working parameters of the neural mechanism which generates perceived length. Current interpretations of changes with age in the perception <b>of</b> <b>size</b> may confuse changes in perceived <b>size</b> given development <b>of</b> <b>size</b> constancy with changes in perceived size based on development <b>of</b> <b>size</b> isomorphism...|$|R

5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures.

Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|Different {{authors have}} {{variously}} reported the birth length at between , and the maturation length at between , with females usually maturing at a slightly larger size than males.

5|$|Garamond died in 1561 and his punches and {{matrices}} {{were sold}} off by his widow. Purchasers included the Le Bé type foundry in Paris {{run by the}} family of Guillaume Le Bé and master printer Christophe Plantin of Antwerp who was in Paris at the time; the Frankfurt foundry often referred to by historians as Egenolff-Berner also came to acquire materials of Garamond's.

5|$|One {{group of}} temnospondyls, the Branchiosauridae, {{is also known}} from larval specimens.

An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range <b>of</b> <b>sizes</b> among specimens, {{but the lack of}} terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic. Unlike other temnospondyls, their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature. Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles. Recently, large specimens of Apateon gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle, indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety <b>of</b> <b>sizes</b> and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E

40|$|Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are {{commonly}} used in paediatric anaesthesia. A well-placed LMA should provide a direct view of the vocal cords facilitating bronchoscopy or fibreoptic intubation. The aim of this audit {{was to assess the}} bronchoscopic view of the glottis obtained through an LMA with regard to its size. We prospectively assessed the position of LMAs in relation to the glottic aperture in 350 children (zero to seven years) undergoing elective fibreoptic examination of the upper and/or lower airways. Following induction of anaesthesia and positioning of the LMA, a fibreoptic evaluation of the view of the glottis was performed (complete, partial or no visualisation). Chest movement on manual ventilation was judged as good in the majority of patients and adequate for the remainder. No overt signs of airway obstruction were noted in any patient. However, a complete view of the glottic aperture was present in only 50 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 1 LMAs, 57. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 1. 5, 72. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 2 and 77. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 2. 5. The epiglottis impinged on the LMA opening, partially obstructing the view of the glottis in 36. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 1 LMAs, 31. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 1. 5, 21 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 2 and 17. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>size</b> 2. 5.

The findings indicate that even if ventilation is judged as adequate, smaller paediatric LMAs are more commonly associated with suboptimal anatomical positioning with partial obstruction of the glottic aperture than larger LMAs, and therefore may require repositioning more often...|$|R
