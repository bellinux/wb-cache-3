Ships with this configuration <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> armour are classified as broadside ironclads.|$|E

5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Pike and his men, {{knowing they}} risk being double-crossed by Mapache, devise {{a way of}} {{bringing}} him the stolen weapons without him double-crossing them.

Surrounded by Mapache's army, Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and tortured. Mapache lets Engstrom go, and he rejoins Pike's gang and tells them what happened.|$|E

5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, the total number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> gun mounts was reduced from 20 guns in ten mounts to 12 guns in six mounts during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At {{the time of the}} 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|A {{score of}} veteran {{officers}} became teachers at his military school. Luna devised two courses of instruction, planned the reorganization, with {{a battalion of}} tiradores and a cavalry squadron, set up an inventory <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> ammunition, arsenals, using convents and town halls, quartermasters, lookouts and communication systems. He built trenches {{with the help of}} his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, and had his brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented coordination between various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also a condition that the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was known}} in Europe during the High Middle Ages due to the usage <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> explosives by the Mongols and the Chinese firearms experts employed by the Mongols as mercenaries during the Mongol conquests of Europe, {{it was not until}} the Late Middle Ages that European versions of cannons were widely developed. The first cannons introduced into Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the Christian wars against Muslims in the 13th century; their use was also first documented in the Middle East around this time. English cannons first appeared in 1327, and later saw more general use during the Hundred Years' War, when primitive cannons were engaged at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. By the end of the 14th century, the use of cannons was also recorded in Russia, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love <b>of</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} time, through {{contact with other}} tribes that had more European contact, the Yavapai began to adopt certain European practices. They raised some livestock and planted crops, also adopting some modern tools and weaponry. In a syncretic way, they adopted elements of Christianity. An estimated 25% of the population {{died as a result}} of smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, smaller losses than for some tribes, but substantial enough to disrupt their societies. With the use <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> other weapons, they began to change methods of warfare, diplomacy, and trade. They used livestock raiding, either from other tribes such as the Maricopa, or from Spanish settlements to their south, to supplement their economy. They often acquired human captives in raids, whom they traded as slaves to Spaniards in exchange for European goods.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1915, many Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab {{province}} alone by some estimates) had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans {{had been made to}} attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December 1914, several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915.|$|E
