5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Estate {{houses in}} Scotland or Scottish country houses, are large houses usually on landed estates in Scotland. They were built from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by more comfortable residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds. The origins of Scottish estate houses are in aristocratic emulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> building and rebuilding of royal residences, beginning with Linlithgow, under the influence of Renaissance architecture. In the 1560s the unique Scottish style of the Scots baronial emerged, which combined features from medieval castles, tower houses, and peel towers with Renaissance plans, in houses designed primarily for residence rather than defence.|$|E

5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005.

Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.|$|E
5|$|In 866, Northumbria was in {{the midst}} of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and {{captured}} York. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe. The last ruler of an independent Jórvík, Eric Bloodaxe, was driven from the city in 954AD by King Eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> damage {{resulting}} from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times Square filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt {{that it would not}} be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> renovation required in order to make it suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E

5|$|The foreign press {{suggested}} that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 {{to avoid the}} gossip which swept London society {{in the wake of}} the scandal. This is not true; the trip had actually been planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part of ceremonies. In the style of the time, a great many animals were shot for sport.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} neglect {{following}} {{the closing of the}} hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensive</b> Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
