25|$|In {{the course}} of normal use, there are three {{predominant}} types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The {{most important of these}} is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>and</b> especially the platform on which the dancer balances.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep. A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely {{from one end to}} the other. The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an electrical shock would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move to the other end of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move to the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>and</b> avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.|$|E

25|$|On 1 September, Benfica signed Bryan Cristante and {{extended}} Sílvio's loan. On 11 September, Benfica signed Jonas. On 12 September, after the early {{break for the}} Euro 2016 qualifying, Benfica returned with a 0–5 win at Vitória de Setúbal, with a hat-trick from Talisca, in his first goals in the Primeira Liga. Furthermore, Samaris and Cristante made their debuts for Benfica, while Ola John scored his first goal in the league. On 16 September, in the first matchday of the Champions League, Benfica lost 0–2 to Zenit. Hulk scored, Artur was sent off for a foul on Danny outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> <b>and</b> former Benfica player Witsel scored the second goal. It was Benfica's first home defeat in 51 matches, and the first home defeat in the Champions League since 2 October 2012. On 21 September, Benfica struggled to defeat Moreirense, suffering an early goal from João Pedro in the debut of Júlio César. In the second half, after Marcelo Oliveira was sent off for tackling Talisca, Eliseu scored from 30 meters out; eight minutes later Maxi Pereira untied the match; and in the final minutes Lima scored from penalty kick after being tackled in the box. On 27 September, Benfica won at Estoril (2–3) with two goals from Talisca and one from Lima. Winning 0–2, the Eagles allowed Estoril to tie the match, with goals from Diogo Amado and Kléber, but in an individual effort from Derley, Lima scored the winning goal.|$|E

500|$|When {{the last}} of the Ives {{brothers}} died in 1888, board game titans Charles and George Parker purchased the rights to The Mansion of Happiness. [...] In 1894, Parker Brothers republished The Mansion of Happiness in their new patented box. [...] The game came with a cover on top of a box. The game board was attached to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>and</b> a drawer was added to the box for the implements and spinner. A teetotum was no longer needed as a metal pointer could be attached to a lithographed card using a pop rivet. The pointer could then spin around to produce a random number. The game board and box top were printed using lithography, making the game look like a work of art. Some of the vice spaces were removed (those depicting women engaged in immoral acts and behaviors), and men were substituted for women in the House of Correction. The game remained in the Parker Brothers catalog for thirty years, displaying the line, [...] "The first board game ever published in America" [...] on its box cover.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Apple did {{not officially}} {{acknowledge}} this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue {{have been subject}} to censorship. The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported that six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users that this was a hardware issue which could not be repaired, and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating that they were [...] "tired of pulling service stock out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> <b>and</b> seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement".

500|$|Newton {{takes the}} box to a crowded subway station, and entices a {{homeless}} man (Eric Lynch) to watch the box for a short while, expecting the person to steal it after he leaves. The Fringe team is soon on the scene having discovered the ultrasound signal, and find all of the passengers at the station are dead. They find no evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> <b>and</b> fear that someone took it into the tunnels and may still be active; the ultrasound would kill everyone on any train that passed. Peter offers to go find the box, and Walter has the idea to make Peter momentarily deaf by having Fauxlivia fire her gun next to Peter's ears. He finds the box, its lid cracked, in the dead hands of the homeless man. Without a way to seal the lid, Peter is forced to try to defuse the box. He does so in time before his hearing returns, but cannot hear the warning of an errant train bearing down on him; Fauxlivia enters the tunnels to save Peter. After recovering, Peter and Walter surmise the box {{is part of the}} machine, and Peter begins studying it. On her own, Fauxlivia contacts the parallel world through the typewriter shop, informing them that Peter [...] "has the first piece" [...] and is now [...] "engaged".|$|E

[...] With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts. [...] Bored, she soon became infatuated with her first cousin, George FitzClarence, illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence. [...] FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte's gaze fell on Lieutenant Charles Hesse of the Light Dragoons, reputedly the illegitimate son of Charlotte's uncle, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. [...] Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings. [...] Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent's rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter's passion. She did everything that she could to encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments. [...] These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain. Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.|$|E

Ken Griffiths was unable to recover from a knee injury {{in time for the}} match and so was replaced by Derek Tomkinson, this was the first and only change to the first eleven throughout the cup run. In the match itself, Albion's 'constructive play' was halted by the Vale defence, and a Leake goal on 40 minutes saw Vale 1–0 up at half-time. The second half saw the [...] "Throstles" [...] switch to a long ball game, and on 62 minutes Cheadle was bustled off the ball and could only watch the equaliser cross the line.
