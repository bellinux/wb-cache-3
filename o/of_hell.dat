5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E

5000|$|On Full <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> songs, Stewart-Panko said, [...] "Their {{half of this}} split ('Fox Womb' and 'Reeds In A River, Dry') is {{mired in}} miserable, pitch-black emotion {{conveyed}} by a thick and wiry guitar sound, dual-vocal contrasts and a reverbed-out production value that recalls basement show abrasion and early-'90s death metal." [...] On Full <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> side, Pfleider said the band is, [...] "a terrifying group of kids. The wall of guitars mixed with the [...] "devil-escaping" [...] opening vocals of 'Fox Womb' is an opening murder scene. The track moves from barking sludge to quick hitting hardcore and back to drowning before feeding into the hardcore exorcism of 'Reeds In a River, Dry.'" [...] On Full <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> side, Hume wrote, [...] "'Fox Womb' lurches to life in slow, steady chords until it suddenly unravels into maniacal screeching and growls before ending on a lucid, fading scream. Full <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> nature imagery and song titles suggest a war of all against all, a world of imminent extinction and human knowledge of this fact. This theme is continued in Full <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> second track, 'Reeds in a River, Dry.'" ...|$|R
