40|$|Abstract <b>One-stop-shops</b> (OSSs) are not {{a recent}} invention, but they are {{currently}} popular as governments attempt to address complaints about fragmentation in public service delivery. OSSs often struggle with multiple implementation problems. This review assesses ten years of research into government <b>one-stop-shops,</b> and seeks to determine drivers and barriers relevant to the adoption and implementation of OSSs in the public sector. OSS reforms are frequently promoted as win-win solutions, allegedly delivering seamless service at lower cost. Such promises are appealing to political decision makers, but typically understate the complexities, costs and risks of the OSS approach. When the time comes for implementation, managers often struggle with unrealistic political and citizen expectations, turf conflicts, inadequate resources, and dilemmas relating {{to the need for}} administrative specialisation. OSSs tend to be more successful where the goal of seamless service is pursued gradually, with sufficient resources, and where implementers address trade-offs between integration and specialisation...|$|R

[...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)."

50|$|As the Meijer store chain grew, {{it caught}} the {{attention}} of Walton. He acknowledges that his <b>one-stop-shopping</b> center format was based on Meijer’s innovative concept.Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity to Wal-Mart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800 was achieved.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{about the role of}} freight {{forwarders}} in managing international logistic chains, where they are often seen as their 'architects'. But they are in danger of being by-passed or disintermediated, due to organisational and/or technological reasons. First, a need for an integrated approach to logistic chain has been already recognised in theory and prac-tice. Multinational firms in the industry or retail sector i. e. show an increasing demand for complex transport and logistic service like world-wide door-to-door delivery or <b>one-stop-shopping.</b> Second, the employment of new technologies in connection with the Internet cause a deep change in the relationships along the logistic chain due to a change in inter-mediation. This will be reflected by developing a theoretical framework based on Casson's theory of entrepreneurial networks in international business to provide some insight in the complex relationships between shippers, freight forwarders and other intermediaries or ser-vice providers along the international logistic chain. Key Words: freight forwarder; international logistic chain; entrepreneurial networ...|$|R

Carrie, a superficial, aggressive scenester is dating Sam's wallet. Sam is a shrill, immature, hypochondriac, well-to-do young man.

30|$|Feedback loops {{within and}} among the {{research}} community, system developers, users, and funding bodies govern the development of software systems that involve fire effects predictions. Recently, the interagency Joint Fire Sciences Program has reviewed fire-related software systems. The program is funding development of an IFT-DSS and further development in BlueSky as models of software platforms that support distributed collaboration among fire and fuel managers (Wells 2009). Sporadic funding by funding bodies of the process-based research models that will form the foundation of future fire effects software systems is of concern to researchers. Funding bodies {{are concerned that the}} research community has developed a profusion of software systems, while users are calling for <b>one-stop-shopping.</b> Given the several kinds of information needed by users, a handful of software systems will result (e.g., BlueSky, WFDSS, IFT-DSS). A commitment to steady funding support of research model development by the funding agencies, acknowledgement of the value in the separation of research and software development functions by researchers, and funding support for the coordinated development of fewer, yet more comprehensive software systems are all needed.|$|R
