40|$|In a {{collection}} of more than 50 readings, Mental Health Still Matters reflects the wide diversity of views about how best to understand and explain mental health and distress. Drawing on writings from a range of academic sources, as well as the rich and compelling stories of mental health service users themselves, it provides a sharp challenge to traditional understandings of mental illness and aims to illuminate future thinking, policy and practice. As a sister volume to the best-selling Mental Health Matters, it combines classic writings about mental health theories, perspectives and practices from psychiatry, sociology, psychology and service users, alongside newly commissioned readings. The book is divided into four parts: • Part I discusses and critiques mental health theory in an exploration of contemporary debates. • Part II considers social inclusion as a goal for mental health services and reviews aspects of the services in which inequality continues to dominate. • Part III <b>offers</b> <b>accounts</b> of mental distress by service users, many of whom have used their experience to become teachers, researchers and innovators in mental health work. • Part IV considers some of the challenges faced by practitioners alongside professional responses to the major changes we are seeing in the landscape of mental health. This is an important and innovative collection of readings which has strong cross-disciplinary relevance and appeal. It is essential reading for everyone studying, training or practising in the field of mental health, whether your background is in social studies, health science, medicine or psychology. ...|$|E
40|$|Part One of {{this book}} {{introduces}} the challenges of monitoring and evaluating interventions designed by technical experts {{meeting the needs of}} people who actually use the environment which the interventions are seeking to modify. The chapters in this section seek reconciliation of these tensions through a variety of techniques that seek to engage non-expert voices in providing information and in return offer various degrees of ownership of the interventions. Part Two offers a range of case studies that show monitoring and evaluation in practice in a range of contexts in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Rich, thick descriptions bring out the challenges faced in practice in the field. Various ways forward are offered including greater institutionalisation of monitoring and evaluation in the State, but most point to greater inclusion of people affected by the interventions in the information system – looking to greater influence on decision-making. Part Three explores the frontiers of the contributions of physical science to monitoring and evaluating soil conservation and watershed management. The chapters demonstrate the increasing capacities of physical science to measure changes in the physical environment. The technical sophistication and ingenuity of the techniques is striking for a social scientist. Even the residues of nuclear tests and the Chernobyl disaster can be used to show how soils have moved over the past fifty years. Part Four engages more directly with the inevitable complications when monitoring and evaluation meets the socio-economic organisation of knowledge. The chapters bring out the resource implications of engaging with complex civil societies in a range of contexts from the highly individualistic in the USA to techno-bureaucratically dominated in Pakistan. The book <b>offers</b> <b>accounts</b> of socio-environmental processes {{in a wide range of}} contexts. It also has some of the qualities of a manual in offering numerous Tables with checklists of key variables plus a general concern with forefronting observability of performance and developmental impact...|$|E

40|$|Many {{of those}} {{artefacts}} {{with which we}} are so familiar – including, for example, works of music, photographs, novels, essays, films, television adverts, and graphic designs – share a common ontological nature. I argue in this thesis {{that they are all}} repeatable, and set out to provide an ontological account of these entities that explains the phenomenon of repeatability. In a fruitful meeting of aesthetics and metaphysics, a great deal has been written recently on the ontological nature of musical works. More encompassing enquiries have sought to understand the ontology of artworks in general. I will be responding to and engaging with this body of literature insofar as it also <b>offers</b> <b>accounts</b> of the entities I describe as repeatable. However, my approach gives metaphysical concerns and the phenomenon of repeatability primacy over aesthetic concerns. Here I argue that repeatable artefacts fall into the ontological category of kinds. I develop an account of repeatable artefacts as kinds that has two key components. Firstly, on my view kinds are physical rather than abstract. Secondly, I argue that repeatable artefacts, as kinds, have essences that are purely relational and historical. The thesis begins with a discussion of method. The methodological issue has grown in prominence in recent years, as theorists have sought some higher level arbitration on the expanding number of theories and approaches being offered in response to ontological puzzles. Drawing on the work of Amie Thomasson, I defend a methodology according to which we should develop an ontological account using careful conceptual analysis that assesses our intuitions about the application of referring terms. This commitment to conceptual analysis is then defended from misunderstandings and objections. I apply this method in giving an ontological explanation for the phenomenon of repeatability. I argue that repeatable artefacts are kinds. Kinds are strongly individuated by their essences, which are the conditions that must be satisfied for the kind to be instanced. I then develop an account of kinds as physical multiply located entities, that exist when and where they have instances. This stands in contrast to the prevailing view according to which kinds are abstract. I then set out to give an account of the essences of paradigmatic repeatable artefacts. I argue that this can be done if we are willing to reject the default view according to which essences are at least partly structural, and replace it with an account of purely relational and historical essences. The essences of many paradigmatic repeatable artefacts, I claim, involve causal historical processes of copying. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} teachers' {{perceptions of}} the relationship between teachers and government in the field of curriculum development, in the light of changes in the mode of curriculum control under which teachers carry out their work in Korea and England. In both countries, major recent legislation has brought about fundamental revisions of the curriculum. In Korea, the 1992 sixth National Curriculum declared a decentralization of curriculum development, ostensibly attempting to decrease government control over teachers. In England, the 1988 Education Act imposed a national curriculum: this represented an increase in government control over teachers. The thesis begins with a review of theoretical work relating to modes of curriculum control and professionalism. It then <b>offers</b> <b>accounts</b> of the historical and cultural context of curriculum development and professionalism in Korea and England, providing overviews of curriculum development, teacher education relating to curriculum development, teachers' organizations, hierarchies in society and schools, gender differences in the teaching profession, inspection of teachers, and teachers' relations with parents. A central issue for the thesis is the idea of teachers' professionalism in relation to government intervention in curriculum development. It is the main assumption of the study that teachers' professionalism in the field of curriculum control can be best analysed through an examination of the context in which it is embedded. Thus, this thesis involves empirical studies of structured samples of six primary schools in Korea and nine primary schools in England; questionnaires, interviews and case studies were administered in both countries. These investigations focus on comparing the teachers' perceptions of curriculum &-YQlppment. and professionalism in their different cultural contexts. Comparison serves to improve contextual understanding of teachers' professionalism within two different trends: centralization and decentralization. Examination of the empirical data reveals both similarities and differences between different teachers within each country, and also between teachers in the two countries. Overall, Korean teachers feel that they have only a restricted role in implementing the new curriculum in their own classroom, despite the recent change which introduced some decentralization in curriculum policy [...] Compared with this situation in Korea, despite governmental intervention in curriculum development the majority of English teachers may be characterized as still having an autonomous role in implementing the curriculum. Although there were different orientations and degrees of control among both groups of teachers, the belief in the desirability of teacher control of the curriculum has been a dominant perspective with widespread acceptance in the two countries. This thesis supports the view that teachers' professionalism is shaped by social, political, educational and institutional cultures in a very complicated fashion, and cannot be expected to change quickly or easily. It also demonstrates that teachers' professionalism cannot be conceptualized simply in terms of movement along the continuum between centralization and decentralization. The thesis argues that teachers' professionalism in relation to government intervention is affected much more by-what teachers think, which is shaped in their own cultural contexts, than {{by the nature of the}} change itself as defined by the legislation/Accordingly, it suggests that the strategies for enhancing teachers' professionalism in relation to curriculum development should be considered with reference to the cultural contexts within which they are practised...|$|E
