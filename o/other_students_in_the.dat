Since the students were seated alphabetically, he sat next to the officer who topped the class, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower. <b>Other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class included Joseph Stilwell, Leonard Gerow and Joseph T. McNarney. Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of the class, and stayed on at the Command and General Staff College as its Adjutant General. In 1929, he became a student at the Army War College. On graduation, he was posted back to the Adjutant General's Office in Washington, D.C.|$|E

During the {{formation}} of training squads throughout the school, he is reassigned to Northstar's Alpha Squadron where he serves as the squad leader. At first, he is depicted as close friends with fellow student Julian Keller and the <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellions, but later becomes closer to his teammates. He is especially close to his mentor Northstar, who helps {{him to come to}} terms with his sexuality. Anole is deeply affected by Northstar's death, stating that Northstar understood him and was important as a figure he could confide in.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E

25|$|Plato's {{so-called}} unwritten doctrines are metaphysical theories {{ascribed to}} him by his students and other ancient philosophers but not clearly formulated in his writings. In recent research, they are sometimes known as Plato's 'principle theory' (German: Prinzipienlehre) because they involve two fundamental principles from which the rest of the system derives. Plato is thought to have orally expounded these doctrines to Aristotle and the <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Academy and they were afterwards transmitted to later generations.|$|E
25|$|Bernstein's {{friendships with}} Copland (who {{was very close}} to Koussevitsky) and Mitropoulos were propitious in helping him gain a place in the class. <b>Other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class {{included}} Lukas Foss, who also became a lifelong friend. Koussevitsky perhaps did not teach Bernstein much basic conducting technique (which he had already developed under Reiner) but instead became a sort of father figure to him and was perhaps the major influence on Bernstein's emotional way of interpreting music. Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's conducting assistant and would later dedicate his Symphony No. 2, The Age of Anxiety, to him.|$|E
25|$|James Nabrit Jr., a {{professor}} of law at Howard School of Law, a historically black university, filed suit on behalf of Bolling and the <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District Court for the District of Columbia seeking assistance in the students' admission. When the court dismissed the claim, the case was granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court. While Nabrit's argument in Bolling rested on the unconstitutionality of segregation, the much more famous Brown v. Board of Education (decided on the same day) argued that the idea of 'separate but equal' facilities sanctioned by Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) was a fallacy as the facilities for black students were woefully inadequate. The lead attorney for Bolling was George E. C. Hayes.|$|E

In 1922, the courses were reorganized and Andrusenko continued his studies at the Kiev Military Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1924. Around this time, he married Vera Ignatyevna. In September he became a platoon commander in the regimental school of the 45th Rifle Division's 134th Rifle Regiment and simultaneously a platoon commander in the regiment itself. In January 1925, Andrusenko transferred to command a platoon in the 6th Communications Regiment. He became a rifle platoon commander of the 137th Rifle Regiment in November, while doubling as a regimental school platoon commander. In 1925, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Andrusenko's son Volodya was born in 1926. In October 1929, Andrusenko became an instructor of the Training Corps of the Territorial Administration of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He transferred to instructor duties at the Simferopol Raion Military commissariat in January 1931. In November of the same year, Andrusenko became military commissar of Borodianka Raion. From December 1932, he served as chief of the military office of the Odessa Red Army House. Andrusenko became {{assistant chief of staff}} of the 134th Rifle Regiment in April 1937. In September 1938, he became assistant chief of the 5th Department of the staff of the Central Asian Military District. Andrusenko became commander of the 8th Separate Battalion of Local Troops in April 1940. In April 1941, he became deputy commander of the 837th Rifle Regiment. In the same year, he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in absentia.|$|E

2500|$|Value-added {{modeling}} (also {{known as}} value-added analysis and value-added assessment) {{is a method}} of teacher evaluation that measures the teacher's contribution {{in a given year}} by comparing the current test scores of their students to the scores of those same students in previous school years, {{as well as to the}} scores of <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same grade. In this manner, value-added modeling seeks to isolate the contribution, or value added, that each teacher provides in a given year, which can be compared to the performance measures of other teachers. VAMs are considered to be fairer than simply comparing student achievement scores or gain scores without considering potentially confounding context variables like past performance or income. [...] It is also possible to use this approach to estimate the value added by the school principal or the school as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Cheating {{differs from}} most {{other forms of}} {{academic}} dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all.

Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier time period informs <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1857, Stevenson went to Mr Henderson's School in India Street, Edinburgh, {{but because}} of poor health stayed {{only a few weeks}} and did not return until October 1859. During his many {{absences}} he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, he was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university. In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with <b>other</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Speculative Society (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, Fleeming Jenkin, whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write. Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as [...] "Bob"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art. Each year during vacations, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works—to Anstruther and Wick in 1868, with his father on his official tour of Orkney and Shetland islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of Erraid in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of Walter Scott with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel The Pirate. In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was [...] "wonderfully resigned" [...] to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law (again at Edinburgh University) and be called to the Scottish bar. In his 1887 poetry collection Underwoods, Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession: ...|$|E
