40|$|Electronic drum {{machines}} need algorithms to {{help them}} produce &quot; rhythmic phrases. In [Bilmes, 1992], I claim that three perceptually <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> characterize percussive rhythm: metric content, tempo variation, and deviations (formerly called event-shifts). Herein, I demonstrate that algorithms based on this model may considerably facilitate reproduction of expressive rhythm. I describe one such algorithm which extracts the <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> from a percussive performance. The performance is then resynthesized {{with varying degrees of}} tempo variation and deviations. Without the deviations, the performance sounds mechanical. With them it sounds rich and alive. Consequently, I claim that we should begin a concentrated study on the <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> characterizing percussive rhythm, particularly deviations. To this e ect, development has begun on a graphical drum machine program with which deviations may be explored. ...|$|R

50|$|Much of {{the credit}} for the {{development}} of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician Les Paul, who also helped design the famous electric guitar that bears his name. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer Mary Ford, were the first {{to make use of the}} technique of multitracking to record <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> of a musical piece asynchronously â€” that is, <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> could be recorded at different times.
