2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{elective}} surgical procedures in animals are those that render animals incapable of reproducing. [...] Neutering in animals describes spaying or castration (also please see castration). [...] To spay (medical term: <b>ovariectomy</b> or ovario-hysterectomy) is to completely remove the ovaries and often the uterus of a female animal. [...] In a dog, this is accomplished through a ventral midline incision into the abdomen. In a cat, this is accomplished either by a ventral midline abdominal incision, or by a flank incision (more common in the UK). With an <b>ovariectomy</b> ligatures are placed on the blood vessels above and below the ovary and the organ is removed. With an ovariohysterectomy, the ligaments of the uterus and ovaries are broken down and the blood vessels are ligated and both organs are removed. [...] The body wall, subcutis, and skin are sutured. [...] To castrate (medical term: orchiectomy) is to remove the testicles of a male animal. [...] Different techniques are used {{depending on the type of}} animal, including ligation of the spermatic cord with suture material, placing a rubber band around the cord to restrict blood flow to the testes, or crushing the cord with a specialized instrument like the Burdizzo.|$|E
2500|$|Oophorectomy [...] (from Greek ᾠοφόρος, ōophóros, [...] "egg-bearing" [...] + ἐκτομή, ektomḗ, [...] "a {{cutting out}} of") is the {{surgical}} removal of an ovary or ovaries.

By manipulating light we found that males exposed to short-photoperiods developed smaller flank glands than those exposed to long-photoperiods. Six flank gland volatiles reduced in relative abundance, which possibly coded for reproductive status of males of this seasonally breeding hamster species.

40|$|Female rats are {{relatively}} {{more sensitive to}} reduced lipid versus reduced carbohydrate availability DA Sandoval 1, KK Ryan 1, AD de Kloet 1, SC Woods 2 and RJ Seeley 1 OBJECTIVES: Because females have blunted counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia relative to males, we hypothesized that females would have greater sensitivity to changes in lipid availability. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: To assess this, we examined the feeding response to glucoprivation (2 -deoxyglucose; 2 DG) and lipoprivation (mercaptoacetate; MA) in age-matched male and female Long-Evans rats. RESULTS: Males versus females had significantly greater food intake after 250 mg kg 1 of 2 DG, {{but there were no}} sex differences with the 750 mg kg 1 dose of 2 DG. Glucose responses to 250 mg kg 1 of 2 DG were also significantly greater in males versus females. In contrast, females had a significant increase in food intake with all doses of MA versus saline, and had significantly greater food intake compared with males at the lowest and highest doses of MA with a trend towards significance with the intermediate dose. To determine whether estradiol (E 2) is the mechanism underlying this sexual dimorphism, ovariectomized females were injected with vehicle or 2 mg of E 2 every fourth day to mimic the variations in across the estrous cycle. Ovariectomized females significantly increased feeding and glucose after 250 mg kg 1 of 2 DG over intact females and E 2 had no effect on these responses. Although the feeding response to 2 DG was not different, the glucose response to 2 DG was still significantly greater in males versus <b>ovariectomies</b> females. However, ovariectomized females also did not increase food intake after MA, regardless of E 2 treatment.

Physical modalities included resistance exercise, low level vibration, and low intensity pulsed ultrasound. Nutritional interventions included altering protein, salt, and fat intake; and vitamin D supplementation. Pharmacologic interventions included the use of bisphosphonates and beta blockers.
