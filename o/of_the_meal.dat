Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him.

5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu and structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal.</b> He published {{a series of}} articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E

Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her").

40|$|My past {{interest}} in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> community nutrition has motivated me to analyze <b>the</b> nutrition information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> served during <b>the</b> free <b>meal</b> program in Ames, Iowa by Food at First. Recipes collected for meals on 10 different days are analyzed using Food Processor software. The results {{generated from the}} software show that <b>the</b> average values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> satisfy one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy need recommended for the day. When compared to MyPlate, <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> provide about one third of recommended amount of grains, protein, vegetable and dairy, but not fruits. From the interview with the head chefs and sometimes other volunteers who helped to prepare <b>the</b> <b>meals,</b> they share a common view that some food service organizations in Ames are supports of this program as few large- scale grocery stores provide the food items used for cooking <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> while some bakeries donate their baked goods which are served as desserts during <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> times. Including variations in <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> food, especially fruits and vegetables is a challenge for the head cooks when they mostly have the non-perishable goods in the food pantry to cook. The program is beneficial because it channels the excess food {{to those who are}} in need of food...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} and correlations between chemical analyses and protein quality of 454 batches of SBM of 3 different origins (USA, n= 168; Brazil (BRA), n= 139, and Argentine (ARG), n= 147) were studied. Samples were collected during a 6 -yr period. SBM from USA had more CP, sucrose and stachyose and less NDF (P< 0. 001) than SBM from ARG and BRA. CP content was negatively related (P< 0. 001) with sucrose for USA meals and with NDF for ARG and BRA meals. Also, P content {{was positively related}} (P< 0. 01) with CP content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals.</b> PDI and KOH solubility were higher (P< 0. 001) for USA than for ARG or BRA SBM, values that were positively related (P< 0. 001) with trypsin inhibitor activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals.</b> In addition, USA meals had more lys, met+cys, thr, and trp than BRA and ARG meals (P < 0. 001). Per unit of CP, lys content was negatively related (P< 0. 001) with CP content for USA, positively for BRA, and no relations was found for ARG meals. It is concluded that nutritive values and protein quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> varied widely among soybean origins.

40|$|Background/Objectives: Health {{effects of}} whole grain foods are {{becoming}} more evident. In this study, we analysed the short-chain fatty acid profiles in urine and serum derived from the colonic fermentation process of 13 C-barley meals, prepared from barley grown under 13 CO 2 atmosphere. Subjects/Methods: In a crossover study, five volunteers ingested intact barley kernels (high content of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starch (RS)) and barley porridge (high content of NSP only). Using a newly developed stable isotope technology, we monitored 14 and 24 [*]h postprandially 13 C-acetate, 13 C-propionate and 13 C-butyrate in plasma and urine, respectively. The oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> was measured with the hydrogen breath test. Results: The OCTT was 6 [*]h and did not differ between <b>the</b> two test <b>meals.</b> An increase of 13 C-acetate was observed already early after ingestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> (&# 8736; 6 [*]h) and was attributed to early fermentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test <b>meal.</b> A rise in plasma 13 C-propionate in the fermentation phase could only be detected after the porridge and not after <b>the</b> kernel <b>meal.</b> An increase in 13 C-butyrate was only found in the fermentation phase and was higher after the barley kernels. Urine 13 C-short-chain fatty acids data were consistent with these observations. Conclusions: The difference in <b>the</b> profiles <b>of</b> 13 C-acetate, 13 C-propionate and 13 C-butyrate indicates that NSP combined with RS results in an altered fermentation profile than dietary fibre alone. </p...|$|R
