25|$|This {{technique}} {{is much more}} efficient than the naïve brute-force search algorithm, which considers all 648=248= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> all the different permutations of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations {{over and over again}} for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 88=224= 16,777,216 blind placements.|$|E
25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers over and over again, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
500|$|As Voltaire himself {{described}} it, {{the purpose}} of Candide was to [...] "bring amusement to {{a small number of}} men of wit". The author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with a fun parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death [...] "as coolly as a weather report". The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Candide is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, [...] "short, light, rapid and humorous".|$|E

Shortly afterwards, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early phases of the battle, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. [...] "It was a miserable damn performance, just like it always is. These people won't listen. They {{make the same mistake}} <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the same way". According to Moyar (2008), in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans' flawed intelligence and poor leadership.

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> different shapes." ...|$|E

Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch.
