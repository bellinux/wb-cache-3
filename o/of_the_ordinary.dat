5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> type.

The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority.

If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively. In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing {{that it would be a}} test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 President Andrew Jackson had vetoed a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, an {{institution}} which he felt extended credit to northeastern commercial tycoons {{at the expense}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> frontiersmen of the Old Southwest, a region with which Jackson, a Tennessean, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an executive order called the Specie Circular which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the Panic of 1837 (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.|$|E

5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} Rowling created {{is intimately}} connected to reality. The British magical {{community of the}} Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and alchemy, incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands, magic plants, potions, spells, flying broomsticks, centaurs, and other magical creatures, the Deathly Hallows, and the Philosopher's Stone, beside others invented by Rowling. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within {{the real world and}} contains magical versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> elements of everyday life, with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England. The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E
