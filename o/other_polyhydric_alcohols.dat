Several lines of evidence suggest that the three-dimensional structure near the active site is involved: (i) The stability of the enzyme when stored at 2 °, or when subjected to repeated freezing and thawing, depends upon the presence of at least 30 % (v/v) glycerol. (ii) In the same solvent, the Km value for DPN and the binding constant for benzaldehyde decrease by 3 - and 10 -fold, respectively, compared with the values obtained for these substrates in fully aqueous media. (iii) Competitive inhibition by trivalent arsenicals with respect to DPN is no longer observed in glycerol; the inhibition becomes mixed and the Ki values increase by 5 - and 50 -fold, respectively, with arsenite and Mapharsen.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the glass transitions of trihydric alcohols using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and compare the results with those previously reported for sugar alcohols. Although a systematic glass transition feature related to molecular size has been reported for sugar alcohols, the essential factor governing this feature is still unclear {{because the number of}} carbon atoms (Nc) and the number of OH groups (N_[OH]) per molecule are identical in sugar alcohols. By examining trihydric alcohols (Nc ≠ N_[OH]), we conclude that N_[OH] is dominant for the characteristics of the slow dynamics, such as fragility and glass transition temperature. This result suggests that the topological structure of the hydrogen-bonding network (coordination number) {{plays an important role in}} the glass transition of <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Furthermore, the orientational correlation factor evaluated using the Kirkwood-Fröhlich theory reveals a similarity in hydrogen bond formation among a variety of <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Based on these two experimental results, we discuss a possible physical picture of the glass transition of <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohols...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aerobacter aerogenes strain 1033 {{grows on}} a number of <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> under both aerobic and {{anaerobic}} conditions. Among these com-pounds are glycerol, D-arabitol, D-sorbitol, and D-mannitol. Under anaerobic conditions the utilization of glycerol and D-arabitol seemed to depend on two diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) -linked enzymes, glycerol dehydrogenase and D-arabitol dehydrogenase. The levels of these two enzymes could be greatly reduced in cells growing on their respective substrates if the cultures were vigorously aerated (Lin, Levin, and Magasanik, 1960; Lin, 1961). In the case of glycerol it was possible to show that the reduc-tion in glycerol dehydrogenase level was com-pensated by an increase in the level of glycerol kinase which mediated a separate pathway for the dissimilation of this <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The control of the levels of glycerol and D-arabitol dehydrogenases by oxygen tension in the growth media stimulated our interest in the possible regulatory role played by oxygen on another DPN-linked enzyme, ethanol dehydrogenase. It has been previously reported that anaerobic dis-similation of glycerol produced equimolar quanti-ties of ethanol and formate (Magasanik, Brooke, and Karibian, 1953). This observation suggests that ethanol dehydrogenase serves as a mediator for the terminal electron transfer during fer-mentation in this organism.

By using a chemical structure of the hexanetriol composed of the deferent number of carbon and OH, it is possible to determine the dominant parameter. From temperature dependence of α relaxation times, it is strongly supported that the number of OH groups is the dominant parameter.

On the other hand, steamed lignin self-condensed during liquefaction after treatment with ozone in the liquid phase. Thus, ozone treatment provided lignin with reactive functional groups, and caused the subsequent condensation reaction. Although lignin was converted to a more condensable structure by ozone treatment, the condensation reaction was found to be suppressed for wood during its liquefaction.
