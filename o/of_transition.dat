5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> metals.

Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{portable}} digital {{devices such as}} laptop personal computers has made low power CMOS circuit design an increasingly important research area.
