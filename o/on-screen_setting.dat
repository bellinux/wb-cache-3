50|$|Megan Ellison and her {{production}} company, Annapurna Pictures, {{acquired the}} franchise rights in May 2011. The following year, production of another installment {{in the series}} {{was set up in}} collaboration with Skydance Productions (owned by Ellison's brother, David). The Ellisons consulted Terminator creator James Cameron in the hope of returning to the spirit of the original film, The Terminator, and its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Principal photography was primarily in New Orleans, with some in the <b>on-screen</b> <b>setting</b> of San Francisco. Six companies handled the film's visual effects; its prosthetic make-up and animatronics were created by Legacy Effects, a studio founded by Terminator veteran Stan Winston.|$|E
30|$|Unlike earlier TAPA {{studies using}} the paper-based approach, teacher {{subjects}} were asked to perform think-aloud marking on the tablet PCs specifically designed for the study to collect data on the nature of composition marking process. The findings of this pilot study relating to teachers’ commentary styles and patterns in an <b>on-screen</b> marking <b>setting,</b> as well as the strategies or solutions they employed to overcome the problems in the composition marking process, have been reported in other paper (Ying et al. 2014). The scope of this paper is focused on the distinguished features of such a tablet-based composition marking recording system, i.e., a camera-free think-aloud protocol instrument, followed by a brief report on the pilot study of our system.|$|R
50|$|Brookside {{differed}} from other soap operas {{because it was}} filmed in real, brand-new houses, in a real cul-de-sac, situated off Deysbrook Lane in the North West city of Liverpool. Built by Broseley Homes, the houses were custom built in {{an attempt by the}} producers to add to the show's realism. In early 1982, Mersey Television, with Phil Redmond at the helm, bought thirteen houses altogether, six of which would be seen <b>on-screen</b> as <b>sets.</b> The remaining seven properties housed administration, postproduction and canteen facilities for the cast and crew. Phil Redmond was particularly enthusiastic about purchasing an entire 'close' of houses, partly as a means of achieving the desired realism of Brookside, but also in order to maintain total control of his creation.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{episode of}} the series is set in 1966. After MacDonald storms off the <b>set,</b> <b>on-screen</b> titles {{indicate}} that [...] "MacDonald died 72 hours later," [...] followed by [...] "Jimmy MacDonald, 1921-1966." [...] The time frame of the other episodes is not given; the previous episodes of the series are not assumed to be set in consecutive weeks, though there is progression with relation to MacDonald's deteriorating state of mind, his relationship with Marg, and his physical reaction to smoking the sponsor's brand of cigarettes.|$|R
5000|$|The third-generation Moto G has a 5-inch display with HD {{resolution}} of 1280x720p and features Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a 13-megapixel camera {{similar to the}} one from the Nexus 6 with many features including HDR imaging and an <b>on-screen</b> exposure <b>setting</b> option, a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor, and the latest version of Android, 6.0.1 [...] "Marshmallow". The phone back is removable, and made of textured plastic. The back also comes in multiple colors available in Motorola's Moto Maker website. The Moto G 3rd-generation is water resistant through the use of nano-coating and internal rubber gaskets, giving it an IPX7 rating. This water resistance gives the phone the ability to be submerged in up to one meter (or about three feet) of water for 30 minutes at a time with the back cover secured correctly. The low-end model comes with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, while the high-end model comes with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. This phone also features a 2470 mAh Li-ion non-removable battery. Both models support LTE.|$|R
5000|$|SAW (Special Access to Windows) is {{a program}} that was created from {{a grant from the}} then Department of Trade and Industry to enable switch users to {{manipulate}} mathematical equations on screen. It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'. These programmable <b>on-screen</b> keyboards (selection <b>sets)</b> are now available for a number of very different applications. SAw 5 is now an open source program available from the Oatsoft web site.|$|R
40|$|Ballistocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} technique that yields {{information about the}} cardiovascular system that is not available in other external signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). In the last years, several research groups have obtained the ballistocardiogram (BCG) by using instrumentation methods simpler than those available in the 1950 s and that did not progress because of their complexity as compared to ultrasound and other noninvasive techniques that are in common use nowadays. We describe a novel method for real-time robust heart- (HR) and respiratory- (RR) rate detection from a subject that stands on a common electronic bathroom scale. BCG signals from the scale are wirelessly sent to a PC where algorithms based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) extract the HR and the RR. HR results are compared to those obtained from the ECG. To better assess the RR results, subjects {{have been asked to}} synchronize their breathing rate to an <b>on-screen</b> bar-graph <b>set</b> at a constant rate of breaths per minute. This method to obtain the heart and respiratory rates is simple, compact, non-invasive and passive, and can be applied to any person able to stand on an electronic weighing scale, even if wearing shoes.

2500|$|Hollyoaks {{planned a}} wedding storyline for Grace and Trevor. When they {{reconcile}} <b>on-screen</b> the pair <b>set</b> about organising their nuptials. Writers also developed an affair storyline for Trevor and Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) {{to coincide with}} the wedding. The latter is due to marry Trevor's enemy Ben Bradley (Ben Richards). They visit each other in secret and concoct a plan to run away together. Kilkelly reported that Grace and Sienna's wedding preparations would see them turn into [...] "bridezillas" [...] clashing with one another over dresses. Passey told Tina Campbell of The Sun that the show were developing an unlikely, [...] "weird friendship" [...] between Sienna and Grace. The actress warned [...] "it will be short-lived", hinting that the affair would story would not be long-running. Viewers were divided over their support for each relationship as both pairing proved popular. Trevor and Sienna were given the fan worship name [...] "Trienna" [...] pitted against [...] "Trace" [...] fans. Wall told Campbell that she was surprised Grace never discovered the affair because she had always been portrayed as clued up about men. She added [...] "there were times when he wouldn't come home, really prominent moments where the audience must be screaming at their TVs going 'come on Grace, work it out!'" ...|$|R
40|$|Bendraujant interneto erdvėse vartotojo išvaizda, socialinis statusas ir kultūrinės vertybės yra nusakomos virtualiais ženklais. Šis procesas gali būti interpretuojamas kaip išskirtinis asmens ir bendruomenės tapatumo kūrimo būdas, kitoks nei kasdieniame gyvenime. Antra vertus, virtualios bendruomenės ryšiai toliau palaikomi ir už kompiuterinio mediumo, todėl virtualios aplinkos laikytinos tiesiog bendruomenės susitikimo vietomis. In {{computer-mediated}} virtual environments, {{users and}} communities {{appear as a}} <b>set</b> of <b>on-screen</b> virtual signs. In the online environment, users express their appearance, social position and cultural values through these signs. Their perception of other individuals in virtual space highly depends of the interpretation of these virtual clues. This process of interpretation {{can be seen as}} a different way to construct a personal or community identity that is unlike similar communication processes in real life. A virtual community, however, extends beyond the computer medium. In this sense, virtual environments can be seen merely as places for community meetings, while the sense and spirit of the community extends to real life. Values and habits of self-representation obtained online are followed also in real life, as well as interpersonal relations formed online continue in the real world. Belonging to the international online community can change even the core habits of users’ communications, for example, users may use English for most daily conversations instead of their native language. Regardless of the medium used for communication (IRC, online discussion boards, etc.), the community and individuals appear <b>on-screen</b> as a <b>set</b> of similar virtual signs. Some of these signs help users to identify affinity with other users, their cultural tastes, values and power in the online community. Differently from the often emphasized fragmentation of postmodern identity, more often than not, users tend to strive for personal integrity and self representation that is coherent, stable and not too far from their real life selves. Virtual signs also serve as criteria for a social choice. For example, users tend to avoid people with offensive nicknames and tasteless avatars or signatures – regardless if such virtual signs represent the real values of the person. On the other hand, virtual signs encourage communication by helping a user to identify groups or people who share the same interests and hobbies through provided cultural clues...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>on-screen</b> [...] title <b>sets</b> {{the action}} in Korea, 1951. The film {{tells the story of}} a young boy, Manuk, who roams a {{seemingly}} deserted town to glean and recycle the debris of war. We first meet him in the wreck of an aeroplane, looking for a particular piece of war refuse - a bolt - to turn into a toy soldier for his collection. He sings a song about a bear. Upon hearing the unmistakable low whistle of a train in the distance he runs to the track and places the bolt on the rail. The train thunders past on its urgent mission to carry tanks to the front. Manuk stands mesmerised, and grins widely. Once the train has passed he retrieves the bolt which has become magnetised. He makes his way through the town, pretending to be a soldier engaged in house-to-house fighting until his attention is captured by the drone of aeroplane engines. Silently he watches them slowly cross the sky. His war game begins again as he crouches behind rocks on a ridge overlooking an area with houses jumbled together. A postman cycles down the road below Manuk’s hiding place. Manuk imagines he is with his dad, pinned down by enemy fire. “Dad, there are too many of them,” he cries as the sound of machine guns and artillery fire fill his head. “But we are braver than them,” his father replies in the game. Manuk picks up a rock as if it is a hand grenade, expertly pulls the pin with his teeth and hurls it at the enemy crying “Dad, get down!” He waits, crouched, fingers in ears for the explosion which never comes. Instead, we hear the postman cry in surprise and pain, before crashing his bicycle and shouting at his unseen tormentor. Manuk slinks away and climbs the hill towards his home. He takes a key from a special hiding spot, and approaches the verandah in front of his house. He notices a parcel and hurries to open it. He pulls out an old leather wallet containing a faded black and white photograph of a man crouching with a child dressed as Manuk is now, but much younger. Manuk gently caresses the photograph with his thumb. He then pulls out a set of dog tags, and an old boot. He marches up and down in front of his house, wearing the boots as if he is a soldier on guard. Later, inside the house, he plays with the toy soldiers and tanks he has made from bits and pieces of metal he has found and falls asleep on the floor. His mother appears at the door, saying “Manuk, Mum is home”.|$|R
