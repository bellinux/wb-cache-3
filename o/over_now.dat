25|$|Initially, Vettori {{took control}} with {{competent}} batting {{and got to}} 27 runs {{at the beginning of}} the 42nd over, with Mills having taken a more passive role at 7 runs. This role was soon to be reversed. Mills hit four sixes in four consecutive balls, over the space of two overs, in a display considered to be worthy of any current top batsman. In the following <b>over,</b> <b>now</b> needing only a run per ball bowled, Vettori was run out by a direct throw from Ricky Ponting, to have New Zealand 9/236.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the first}} Russophile tendencies began to surface, {{and came in}} face of the Uniate Bishop Joseph Semashko. Believing that the Uniate Church's role as an interim bridge between Orthodoxy and their {{eventual}} path to Catholicism is <b>over,</b> <b>now</b> that the ruler of the lands {{is no longer a}} Catholic, but an Orthodox Monarch, he began to push for an eventual reversion of all Uniates. Although the idea was shared by growing number of the lower priests, the ruling Uniate synod, controlled by the strong Polish influence, rejected all Semashko's suggestions. In addition many of the Latin Catholic authorities responded to this by actively converting the Uniates to Latin Rite Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|Essex Eagles won {{the top of}} {{the table}} clash in the National League against Middlesex Crusaders at Lord's, after hitting 50 runs for the last two wickets to seal victory. Middlesex' innings opened with a 101-run {{partnership}} from Paul Weekes and Ed Smith, lasting nearly an hour and a half, as the pair scored at about four an over. A burst of wickets followed, which reduced Middlesex to 144 for 5, but a display of aggressive hitting from Scott Styris – who scored 71 from 43 balls, including seven sixes – took the target up to 244. In reply, Essex scored runs to be {{on a par with the}} required rate, but lost wickets, Irfan Pathan grabbing two and the others helping out as Essex lost their first seven for 182, and Ryan ten Doeschate and former England all-rounder Alex Tudor were at the crease. Tudor went quickly, as did No. 10 Andre Adams, and Essex required 26 for the last wicket. But ten Doeschate, who had earlier been taken for 25 runs in his only <b>over,</b> <b>now</b> made up for it by hitting eight boundaries as the Dutch-South African recorded a career highest score of 51 not out off 41 balls, taking Essex to the target with three balls and a wicket to spare. His batting partner, Darren Gough, contributed with four runs in the seven-minute last-wicket stand worth 26.|$|E

500|$|Bob Dylan {{most likely}} wrote [...] "It's All <b>Over</b> <b>Now,</b> Baby Blue" [...] in January 1965. The master take {{of the song}} was {{recorded}} during the sessions for the Bringing It All Back Home album on January 15, 1965 and was produced by Tom Wilson. The track was recorded {{on the same day}} Dylan recorded the other three songs on side 2 of the album: [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "Gates of Eden" [...] and [...] "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)". However, Dylan had been playing those other songs live for some time, allowing them to evolve before recording of the album commenced. For [...] "It's All <b>Over</b> <b>Now,</b> Baby Blue", Dylan wanted to record the song before he became too familiar with it. There were at least two studio recordings prior to the one that was released on the album. Dylan recorded a solo acoustic version on January 13, 1965 (released in 2005 on [...] ) and a semi-electric version on January 14.|$|E

500|$|The {{version of}} the song on the album is sparsely {{arranged}} with Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica, with William E. Lee playing bass guitar. Author Clinton Heylin states that the song is another of Dylan's [...] "'go out in the real world' songs, like [...] "To Ramona", though less conciliatory – the tone is crueler and more demanding." [...] As well as being the final track on Bringing It All Back Home, [...] "It's All <b>Over</b> <b>Now,</b> Baby Blue" [...] was also the final song to be recorded for the album.|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all <b>over</b> <b>now,</b> Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All <b>Over</b> <b>Now,</b> Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
