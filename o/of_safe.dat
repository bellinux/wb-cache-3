There has also been discussion on the implementation <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> standing.|$|E

5000|$|The 1660 {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>Safed</b> {{occurred during}} the Druze power struggle in Mount Lebanon, {{at the time of}} the rule of Ottoman sultan Mehmed IV. The towns <b>of</b> <b>Safed</b> and nearby Tiberias, with substantial Jewish communities, were destroyed in the turmoil. Only a few of the former residents <b>of</b> <b>Safed</b> had returned to the town after the destruction. Sholem considers the 1662 reports about the destruction <b>of</b> <b>Safed</b> as [...] "exaggerated". The community however recovered within several years, whereas Tiberias lay in waste for decades.|$|R

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, the amount <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move {{at high speed}} and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize the use <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools {{developed for the}} purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> mode and healthy.|$|E

Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used to forge letters <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, {{make sure there are}} appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{advisory}} board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in {{its approach to}} selecting new members of the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee's selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running Sunday Night Sex Show, as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada's Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods <b>of</b> <b>safe</b> sex alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.|$|E
