5|$|In January 2012 Cricket Ireland chief {{executive}} Warren Deutrom publicly declared Ireland's ambition to play Test cricket by 2020. Their desire to achieve Test status {{was in part}} {{to stem the tide}} of Irish players using residency rules to switch to England for the opportunity to play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of back drawing type <b>of</b> flexible multi-gripper <b>stretch</b> forming machine used for double-curvature metal sheet forming, back and down drawing type <b>of</b> flexible multi-gripper <b>stretch</b> forming machine was designed by finite element method (FEM), which has simple structure and cheap cost. The FE model <b>of</b> flexible multi-gripper <b>stretch</b> forming was established, and extensive numerical simulations of spherical parts for two kinds <b>of</b> flexible <b>stretch</b> forming machines were carried out. The variations of stress, strain, thickness and springback value of spherical parts for two kinds of drawing modes were analyzed. The numerical {{results show that the}} quality of spherical parts formed by the back and down drawing type <b>of</b> <b>stretch</b> forming machine is better than that by the back drawing type <b>of</b> <b>stretch</b> forming machine. This work provides a machine for developing the technology <b>of</b> <b>stretch</b> forming...|$|R

5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

40|$|Electromyogram tonic stretch reflex {{responses}} were recorded from biceps brachii muscles in normal and cerebral palsied subjects sustaining either 10 % or 20 % of maximum voluntary contraction {{and attempting to}} keep the elbow stiff in a fixed position. The muscle was stretch by a sinusoidal perturbation applied by the experimenter to the elbow angle. Five different amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>stretch</b> were employed ranging 1. 67 to 10. 0 degrees peak to peak variation of elbow angle. Spectral analysis of the rectified and filtered electromyogram revealed "noisy" sinusoidal reflex responses with negligible harmonic distortion but the amplitude of the reflex responses did not increase linearly with the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>stretch.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> variance showed that for both groups of subjects the gain <b>of</b> the tonic <b>stretch</b> reflex increased significantly (p less than 0. 001) with contraction level and decreased significantly (p less than 0. 001) with magnitude <b>of</b> <b>stretch.</b> This finding illustrates that both magnitude <b>of</b> <b>stretch</b> and level <b>of</b> contraction need to be carefully controlled when measures <b>of</b> tonic <b>stretch</b> reflex responses are used to assess changes of muscle tone...|$|R

25|$|Just as the {{resistance}} of a conductor depends upon temperature, {{the resistance}} of a conductor depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress that leads to strain in the form <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> of the conductor), {{the length of the}} section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing {{the resistance of}} the strained section of conductor. Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on strain gauges for details about devices constructed {{to take advantage of this}} effect.|$|E
25|$|Studies are {{considering}} whether music therapy {{can have a}} beneficial effect on people with Parkinson's Disease. A 3-month study investigated whether there was any motor benefit of music therapy and physical therapy on Parkinson's Disease patients, and whether the therapies had any effect on their emotional well being and their quality of life. The music therapy consisted of choral singing, voice exercise and rhythmic and free body movements, whereas the physical therapy consisted <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> exercises, specific motor tasks and ways to improve balance and gait. The study concluded that music therapy had a beneficial effect on the patient's emotions, it showed an improvement in bradykinesia, and in quality of life. Music therapy however lacked any motor benefit, whereas physical therapy showed that it improved the rigidity of the patients.|$|E
25|$|Typical MRI studies scan a few {{different}} subjects. To {{integrate the}} results across subjects, one possibility {{is to use a}} common brain atlas, and adjust all the brains to align to the atlas, and then analyze them as a single group. The atlases commonly used are the Talairach one, a single brain of an elderly woman created by Jean Talairach, and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) one. The second is a probabilistic map created by combining scans from over a hundred individuals. This normalization to a standard template is done by mathematically checking which combination <b>of</b> <b>stretching,</b> squeezing, and warping reduces the differences between the target and the reference. While this is conceptually similar to motion correction, the changes required are more complex than just translation and rotation, and hence optimization even more likely to depend on the first transformations in the chain that is checked.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator pressed a button on their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E
