5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 legislative election was largely attributed to new an election law that allowed only parties that had won two percent <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the DPR, or three percent <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces {{to stand in the}} 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary {{violence and the}} spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 percent, and the party acquired the largest number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> parliament. Hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} results determined which political parties were eligible to submit candidates for Indonesia's first direct presidential election, {{which was held}} on 5 July. Only parties that received {{five percent of the}} popular vote or three percent <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the People's Representative Council could submit candidates. Parties that did not meet these criteria had to join with other parties to meet at least one criterion.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.|$|E

This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E
5|$|From 1981 to 1983, Weizsäcker {{headed a}} {{minority}} government in West Berlin, after the CDU had only won 48 per cent <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the state assembly. His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party, {{who were in}} a coalition with the Social Democrats {{at the federal level}} at the time. After Helmut Kohl had won the federal election in 1983 and had formed a government with the Free Democrats, Weizsäcker did the same in West Berlin.|$|E

5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza {{the first}} city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian {{municipal}} elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> {{seven of the}} ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes {{between the two parties}} that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 1958, the Tories won what {{is still}} the largest {{majority}} (in terms of percentage <b>of</b> <b>seats)</b> <b>in</b> Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit wiped out. The Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of the}} votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's Union Nationale political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, Union Nationale boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament of Canada is the {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Government of Canada. The Parliament is composed of the House of Commons (lower house), the Senate (upper house), and the Sovereign, represented by the Governor General. Most major legislation originates from the House, {{as it is the}} only body that is directly elected. A new parliament begins after an election of the House of Commons and can sit for up to five years. The number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as population distribution between the provinces changed; there are currently 338 MPs and 105 Senators (when there are no vacancies).|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E
5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though an equal number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad {{in recent years that}} the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} gave Harper's Conservatives {{the largest}} number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the House, although not enough for a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper {{was sworn in as}} Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} Labour administration led by Gordon Brown {{was defeated}} in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won the largest number <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked {{on a series of}} make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number}} of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
