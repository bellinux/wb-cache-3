Biodiesel and bioethanol are the two potential renewable fuels that have attracted the most attention.

Biodiesel from microalgae seems to be the only renewable biofuel that has the potential to completely displace petroleum-derived transport fuels without adversely affecting supply of food and <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> <b>products.</b> Most productive oil crops, such as oil palm, do not come close to microalgae in being able to sustainably provide the necessary amounts of biodiesel...|$|R

40|$|The electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) is a {{transcriptional}} enhancer {{involved in}} cancer-chemoprotective gene expression effects of certain dietary compounds. In {{this study we}} measured the ability of extracts of glycosidase treated tomato fruits from 97 different accessions to induce EpRE-mediated luciferase expression using EpRE-LUX reporter cells and analyzed the same extracts using LC–MSbased untargeted metabolomics profiling. We were able to pinpoint those tomato compounds that were most correlated with EpRE-mediated luciferase induction, by combining reporter gene assay data with the metabolic profiles of the same extracts. Flavonoids were the compounds showing the strongest positive correlation with EpRE-LUX activity. These results were validated using a transgenic tomato line accumulating high levels of flavonoids. Results obtained corroborated that flavonoids are an important determinant of the ability of tomato fruit extracts to induce EpRE-mediated beneficial health effects. Overall, {{these results indicate that}} combining untargeted metabolomics with reporter gene assays provides a powerful tool for nutritionists, plant breeders and food chemists towards identification of potential health-beneficial constituents of tomato fruits, as well as of <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> and <b>products</b> derived thereof...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} in the crop sciences is increasingly impacted by the risk of infringing the intellectual property rights (IPRs; e. g., patents) and tangible property rights (TPRs; e. g., material transfer agreements) of <b>others.</b> Since <b>crop</b> science <b>products</b> now entail such {{a high degree of}} technical complexity, and the processes and components to make such products are so ubiquitously available, the potential for such infringement is simply omnipresent.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the Japanese regulatory issues regarding pesticide use in rice paddies and an introduction of the new pesticide registration program. In addition, the experience of the environmental monitoring of pesticides and the modeling approaches used for the calculation of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in surface water and ground water systems adjacent to rice paddies in Japan are also discussed. Japan {{has been one of the}} major pesticide users in the world. Although having a long history in rice cultivation, the pesticide exposure assessment for paddy rice production received less attention compared with EU and US. Applications of up-to-date techniques and the development of realistic assessment procedures under specific climatic conditions as well as mitigation management practices for controlling pesticide contamination are important for an environmental-friendly rice production. Through the international cooperation and research exchanges, advances in pesticide risk assessment for rice paddies in Asian region and other rice-growing areas in the world would contribute to sustainable rice production. Transplanting of rice seedlings grows almost all rice paddies in Japan. The land preparation starts around April and June, and the harvest season lasts from August to October depending on the region and the rice varieties. Most of the rice paddies are treated with herbicides and <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> protection <b>products,</b> such as fungicides and insecticides that are applied during the crop season accordingly.

40|$|Despite their {{importance}} as pollinators in crops and wild plants, solitary bees have not previously {{been included in}} non-target testing of insect-resistant transgenic crop plants. Larvae of many solitary bees feed almost exclusively on pollen and thus could be highly exposed to transgene products expressed in the pollen. The potential effects of pollen from oilseed rape expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin- 1 (OC- 1) were investigated on larvae of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis ( = O. rufa). Furthermore, recombinant OC- 1 (rOC- 1), the Bt toxin Cry 1 Ab and the snowdrop lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) were evaluated for effects on the life history parameters of this important pollinator. Pollen provisions from transgenic OC- 1 oilseed rape did not affect overall development. Similarly, high doses of rOC- 1 and Cry 1 Ab {{as well as a}} low dose of GNA failed to cause any significant effects. However, a high dose of GNA (0. 1 %) in the larval diet resulted in significantly increased development time and reduced efficiency in conversion of pollen food into larval body weight. Our results suggest that OC- 1 and Cry 1 Ab expressing transgenic crops would pose a negligible risk for O. bicornis larvae, whereas GNA expressing plants could cause detrimental effects, but only if bees were exposed to high levels of the protein. The described bioassay with bee brood is not only suitable for early tier non-target tests of transgenic plants, but also has broader applicability to <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> protection <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since its {{discovery}} as a microbial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been}} widely used to control insect pests important in agriculture, forestry, and medicine. The wide variety of formulations based on spore-crystal complexes intended for ingestion by target insects, {{are the result of}} many years of research. The development of a great variety of matrices for support of the spore-crystal complex enables many improvements, such as an increase in toxic activity, higher palatability to insects, or longer shelf lives. These matrices use many chemical, vegetable or animal compounds to foster contact between crystals and insect midguts, without harming humans or the environment. Biotechnology companies are tasked with the production of these kinds of bioinsecticides. These companies must not only provide formulations tailored to specific crops and the insect pests, but they must also search for and produce bioinsecticides based on new strains of high potency, whether wild or genetically improved. It is expected that new products will appear on the market soon, providing an increased activity spectrum and applicability to many <b>other</b> pestimpacted <b>crops.</b> These <b>products</b> may help develop a more organic agriculture.

40|$|Agriculture confronts several {{challenges}} {{over the}} decade, i. e., meeting burgeoning food requirements with limited farm land, and balancing {{the need to}} import with the provision of livelihoods. The current policy regime leans heavily toward import substitution, with supply side interventions to boost production, combined with protectionism toward sensitive products (particularly rice). The study conducts a scenario analysis to examine the likely evolution of Philippine agriculture to 2020, {{as well as the}} implications of pursuing alternative policies. It finds that, under a business-as-usual scenario: Agricultural growth continues with dramatic increases for rice production in the offing. Likewise per capita consumption of most food items would continue increasing. Import growth is curtailed, with substantial price increases for meat products and rice. The alternative scenario involves liberalization and re-allocation of expenditure support toward export-oriented agricultural subsectors. Under this scenario, imports of rice, yellow maize, and poultry increase, with faster increases in per capita consumption than under business-as-usual, and lower retail prices. While consumers gain, producers of import-competing products face harsher competition and cut back on their production. Deepest cuts are expected for rice. Export-oriented commodities experience a production and export boost, with brightest prospects for <b>other</b> <b>crops,</b> banana, aquaculture <b>products,</b> and even coconut. This study recommends the outward-oriented policy, with concomitant measures to compensate losers, ease the burden of adjustment, and facilitate the transition toward a more diversified and dynamic agricultural sector...|$|R
