6000|$|With an {{authoritative}} gesture Daman had parted {{the ranks of}} Belarab's young followers with the red skullcaps and was seen advancing toward the whites striking into an astonished silence all the scattered groups in the courtyard. But the broken ranks had closed behind him. The Illanun chiefs, for all their truculent aspect, were much too prudent to attempt to move. They had not needed for that the faint warning murmur from Daman. He advanced alone. The plain hilt of a sword protruded from the <b>open</b> <b>edges</b> of his cloak. The parted edges disclosed also the butts of two flintlock pistols. The Koran in a velvet case hung on his breast by a red cord of silk. He was pious, magnificent, and warlike, with calm movements and a straight glance from under the hem of the simple piece of linen covering his head. He carried himself rigidly and his bearing {{had a sort of}} solemn modesty. Lingard said hurriedly to Mrs. Travers that the man had met white people before and that, should he attempt to shake hands with her, she ought to offer her own covered with the end of her scarf.--"Why?" [...] she asked. [...] "Propriety?"--"Yes, it will be better," [...] said Lingard and the next moment Mrs. Travers felt her enveloped hand pressed gently by slender dark fingers and felt extremely Oriental herself when, with her face muffled to the eyes, she encountered the lustrous black stare of the sea-robbers' leader. It was only for an instant, because Daman turned away at once to shake hands with Lingard. In the straight, ample folds of his robes he looked very slender facing the robust white man.|$|E

A guard edge of a polygon is an edge that sees every point inside the polygon.

50|$|In the mid-1980s, {{isolated}} {{occurrences of}} rigid hornwort had {{established in the}} lake, and, by the mid-1990s, abundant quantities of other aquatic plants such as ivy duckweed and the liverwort Riccia fluitans, were reported along <b>open</b> <b>edges</b> of the lake.

In the mid-1980s, the only fauna reported was sparse occurrences of larvae and non-biting midges.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} growth energetics of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with gas-phase CO molecules is investigated. Our density functional calculations {{show that}} CO molecules can form carbon networks directly at an <b>open</b> <b>edge</b> of SWNT by adsorption and subsequent desorption procedure. CO molecules adsorb to the carbon atom in an <b>open</b> <b>edge</b> of the SWNT, {{not through the}} oxygen atom but through the carbon atom, because the frontier orbital of the CO molecule has more carbon character. Such adsorption results {{in the formation of}} a carbon-carbon bond. Formation of a hexagonal carbon ring is thermodynamically more favorable than that of a pentagonal carbon ring and becomes a driving force for the growth of SWNTs. A possible growth mechanism through formation of hexagonal ring structure is suggested from the results of this study.

50|$|The term safety razor {{was first}} used in 1880 and {{described}} a basic razor with a handle attached to a head where a removable blade may be placed.

There {{are two types of}} safety razors, the single edged and the double-edged. The single-edged razor is essentially a 4 cm long segment of a straight razor. The double-edged safety razor is a razor with a slant bar that can be used on both sides, with two <b>open</b> <b>edges.</b> The blade on the double-edged safety razor is slightly curved to allow for a smoother and cleaner shave.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} question: How many edge guards {{are needed to}} guard an {{orthogonal}} polyhedron of e edges, r of which are reflex? It was previously established [3] that e/ 12 are sometimes necessary and e/ 6 always suffice. In contrast to the closed edge guardsused for these bounds, we introduce a new model, <b>open</b> <b>edge</b> guards (excluding the endpoints of the edge), which we argue are in some sense more natural in this context. After quantifying the relationship between closed and <b>open</b> <b>edge</b> guards, we improve the upper bound to show that, asymptotically, (11 / 72) e (<b>open</b> or closed) <b>edge</b> guards suffice, or, in terms of r, that (7 / 12) r suffice. Along the way, we establish tight bounds relating e and r for orthogonal polyhedra of any genus. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} imposed flow {{velocity}} on flame spread along <b>open</b> <b>edges</b> of a thermally thin cellulosic sample in microgravity are studied experimentally and theoretically. In this study, {{the sample is}} ignited locally at {{the middle of the}} 4 cm wide sample and subsequent flame spread reaches both <b>open</b> <b>edges</b> of the sample. The following flame behaviors are observed in the experiments and predicted by the numerical calculation; in order of increased imposed flow velocity: (1) ignition but subsequent flame spread is not attained, (2) flame spreads upstream (opposed mode) without any downstream flame, and (3) the upstream flame and two separate downstream flames traveling along the two <b>open</b> <b>edges</b> (concurrent mode). Generally, the upstream and downstream edge flame spread rates are faster than the central flame spread rate for an imposed flow velocity of up to 5 cm/s. This is due to greater oxygen supply from the outer free stream to the edge flames than the central flames, For the upstream edge flame, the greater oxygen supply results in a flame spread rate that is nearly independent of, or decreases gradually, with the imposed flow velocity. The spread rate of the downstream edge, however, increases significantly with the imposed flow velocity...|$|E
