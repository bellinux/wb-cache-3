25|$|The colour of the Malabar {{trevally}} {{is usually}} a silver overlain by a bluish-grey hue on the upper side of the fish fading to a silvery white on the underside and lower flanks. The <b>opercle</b> has a single small black spot on the upper margin, and the tongue is a distinctive greyish brown to brown. The caudal fin, soft dorsal and anal fins are pale greenish yellow to dusky, while other fins are hyaline in appearance. The tips of the dorsal, anal and caudal fins are occasionally edged in a shade of white.|$|E
25|$|The {{body is a}} sandy brown to {{olive green}} colour above, while the sides and lower body are a silvery brown to cream-white hue. The head is dark olive brown to greenish above, while the cheeks and opercles are golden-green, with a dark blotch on the <b>opercle</b> of some individuals. The trumpeter whiting is usually easy to {{distinguish}} by its characteristic dark brown irregular blotches present {{on the side of}} the fish, as well as a golden silver longitudinal band. The spinous dorsal fin is whitish, with a mottled olive green and brown texture. The soft dorsal fin has about five rows of brownish green spots. The anal and ventral fins are golden to yellow with cream margins, while the pectoral fins are yellow to pale yellow-green, with a distinct black-blue spot at the base. The caudal fin is olive brown to a darkish green-brown with darker margins.|$|E
40|$|Previous ageing studies {{compared}} {{the precision of}} yellow perch (Perca flavescens) scales to otoliths and scales to <b>opercles</b> and in each study, scales were proven to be less precise. To date, a comparative study between yellow perch otoliths and <b>opercles</b> has not been undertaken. Therefore, the goal of our study was to compare ageing precision of <b>opercles</b> to otoliths, while establishing the best methodology to use for ageing otoliths. <b>Opercles</b> and otoliths were collected from 217 yellow perch {{in the summer of}} 2003 from three sites located in southern Lake Michigan. <b>Opercles</b> were read as whole structures, while otoliths were read whole, sectioned, and break and burn. All four methodologies were aged three times by three independent readers. <b>Opercles,</b> sectioned otoliths, and break and burn otoliths were found to be the most precise structures for aging. Further investigation into the ageing of yellow perch improves the efficiency and precision of the ageing process. As a result, better fisheries management practices can be utilized.

2500|$|Stargazers {{are about}} 50 species of fishes, {{belonging}} to the family Uranoscopidae, and found worldwide in shallow waters. Stargazers are venomous; they have two large poison spines situated behind the <b>opercle</b> and above the pectoral fins. They can also deliver electric shocks. They are ambush predators with eyes {{on top of their}} heads (thus the name). Stargazers also have a large upward-facing mouth in a large head. They bury themselves in sand with only their eyes showing, and leap upwards to ambush fish and invertebrates overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey's attention. Lengths range from 18 cm up to 90cm, for the giant stargazer Kathetostoma giganteum. Stargazers are a delicacy in some cultures. The venom is destroyed when it is cooked, and stargazers are sold in some fish markets with their electric organ removed. They have been called [...] "the meanest things in creation" [...] and the [...] "worst pet on earth".|$|E

40|$|Gobiidae, {{the largest}} fish family (> 1500 species), has species {{from at least}} 10 genera that produce sounds for communication. Studies focused on goby sound {{production}} mechanisms have suggested that sounds are produced by the forcible ejection of water through small apertures in the <b>opercles</b> (hydrodynamic mechanism). The present study was a multidisciplinary investigation (morphology, muscle histology, high-speed video, sound analysis and electromyography) of the sound emission mechanism in Gobius paganellus, which produces both pulsed and tonal calls. Two populations were used, from Brittany and Venice. In the French population, sounds were accompanied by a suite of coordinated movements of the buccal, branchial and opercular regions. This {{was not the case}} in the Venetian population, and thus the direct role of head movements in sound production was rejected. The hydrodynamic mechanism hypothesis was also rejected in G. paganellus on the basis of sound oscillogram shape and because sounds are still produced after the <b>opercles</b> and hyohyoid muscles are cut. The use of both electromyography and electron microscopy showed that the levator pectoralis muscle, which originates on the skull and inserts on the dorsal tip of the cleithrum, is involved in sound production. We propose that the contraction of this muscle and associated vibration of the large radials is used to make sounds. In addition, we propose that different sound types (pulsed sounds and tonal calls) could occur because of differences in fish size. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|P>During the rearing {{process of}} gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), {{abnormal}} {{development of the}} opercular bone is particularly common (Aquaculture 156, 1997, 165). In order to alleviate its occurrence in rearing facilities, it's crucial to identify the very first physical signs of deviation in normal skeletal development. Nano-CT-scanning was tested for its applicability to quantify deviations in bone mineralization levels. Seven <b>opercles</b> were dissected from larvi of 65 days post hatching, randomly sampled at the commercial sea bream hatchery Maricoltura di Rosignano Solvay (Livorno, Italy). The samples were nano-CT-scanned and computationally reconstructed. Mineralization intensity was colorcoded using Amira software, resulting in a detailed visualization of opercular morphology and mineralization patterns.

50|$|The {{razorback}} scabbardfish attains a maximum length of 2.5 m. Its diet consists of fishes, {{such as the}} Californian anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and the North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and squid. The only known parasite of the {{razorback scabbardfish}} is the copepod Avitocaligus assurgericola. Reproduction is presumably oviparous with pelagic eggs and larvae as {{with other members of}} the family, though eggs and newly hatched larvae have not been described. Flexion (the bending of the notochord as part of caudal fin formation) occurs at around a length of 14 mm. Post-flexion larvae have slender bodies and pointed heads, with the pelvic and first dorsal spines elongated. They can be distinguished by the presence of pigment on the top of the head, snout, and <b>opercles.</b> This species is not targeted by fisheries; it is sometimes hooked or netted, or found washed ashore.|$|R

40|$|We redescribe Iracema caiana, a {{monotypic}} genus of the gymnotiform electric fish family Rhamphichthyidae. Iracema {{is known}} {{only from the}} type series (holotype and three paratypes) collected from the rio Jauaperi, affluent to the rio Negro in the Amazon basin, and was never collected again. Previous morphological studies were limited to features of external morphology. To study the osteology of Iracema we examined two specimens of different sizes using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography, a non-invasive and non-destructive technique to visualize internal anatomical structures. We describe and illustrate the osteology of Iracema caiana, and present data on morphometrics and external morphology. Contrary to previous hypotheses we propose that Iracema is the sister group to Rhamphichthys based on four synapomorphies: intermuscular bones present in the adductor mandibulae, reticulated texture of <b>opercles,</b> fully ossified Baudelot's ligaments, and elongate scales above the lateral line in the posterior portion of the body...|$|R

40|$|Ageing methodologies of Lake Michigan alewife were {{evaluated}} as {{a precursor to}} growth and condition investigations of alewife stocks. Four commonly used aging tissues {{were evaluated}} including: otoliths, scales, vertebrae, and <b>opercles.</b> Otoliths were significantly more precise than other structures in all analyses. The accuracy of age determinations given by otoliths was corroborated through length frequency analysis. Total processing time was highest for scales. Whole otolith methodology was used to age alewives from Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin based on precision, accuracy, and time efficiency. A trend of higher median lengths and weights in young fish from the Green Bay, Wisconsin site was identified. Older fish grew faster in the main-lake sample sites near Pentwater, Michigan and Indiana waters. The Indiana population had the highest condition factor (K), while Wisconsin had the lowest, with Michigan in between. An overall temporal decline in condition of alewife was identified when compared with historical studies. This is a consideration that may influence salmonid stocking decisions because the alewife serves as their primary food. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between morphology and diet in four Andean killifishes (Orestias) from Lake Titicaca that are known to differ in habitat use. Species that fed preferentially on amphipods (Orestias albus) or molluscs (Orestias luteus) separated in multivariate space from other species that feed on cladocera and algae (Orestias agassii and Orestias jussiei). Generally, specimens feeding on cladocera were characterized by a short, blunt nose with a small mouth; whereas, specimens feeding on amphipods exhibited a long snout with a large mouth. Specimens including molluscs in their diet tended to have a larger posterior part {{of the head and}} the larger <b>opercles</b> than others; while the occurrence of substratum in gut content was generally related to a short but deep head. The present analysis suggests that the littoral O. jussiei has an intermediate phenotype and diet between the pelagic (O. agassii) and benthic (O. albus and O. luteus) species. Results suggest that resource partitioning was occurring and that several morphological traits relate to characteristics of the diet, and it is inferred that the benthic, the pelagic and the littoral zones in the lake host different prey communities constituting distinct adaptive landscapes...|$|R
