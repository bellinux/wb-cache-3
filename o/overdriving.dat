25|$|Psychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists {{may play}} punk-style power chords one moment, and then shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or {{by using the}} tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube {{amplifiers}} such as by makers such as Fender and {{it is common to}} see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by <b>overdriving</b> the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion pedal.|$|E

Los Angeles Times Jeff Weiss viewed the song as [...] "generic" [...] with Usher [...] "singing generic paeans to a paramour’s eyes over a Eurovision-like Max Martin production." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine disapproved of the track as a whole, writing [...] "DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love is, while indistinguishable from any other <b>overdriving</b> club banger, {{one of the only}} songs in which Usher Raymond acknowledges an aphrodisiac more powerful than his own ab musk".|$|E
500|$|During {{six weeks}} in the studio, the Strokes' gritty sound became the {{emphasis}} of the sessions. The band usually recorded songs only once, based on Casablancas's preference for [...] "raw efficiency". RAT effects pedals and <b>overdriving</b> amplifiers were used at times, [...] "taking sounds, disintegrating them and then bringing them back". The band wanted things to be only slightly stressed, with no heavy-handedness in terms of studio effects; only distortion and reverse echo were widely used. Throughout the process, Raphael improvised according to the reactions that he got from the group. At one point, he {{had to cope with}} the threat of eviction from his Transporterraum studio, but once the Strokes received backing from RCA, time and money were no longer pressing concerns. The label's A delegate initially did not like what had been recorded and felt that the album {{was not going to be}} professional enough. The producer and the band were given complete control only when Casablancas persuaded the delegate by playing him some of the new material on a boom box.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced opened with [...] "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the {{exception}} of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a highly desirable London socialite who later married the Who's Roger Daltrey. It begins with the fade-in of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar's control knob, he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he slides into the song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by <b>overdriving</b> his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. While author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul, David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.|$|E

2500|$|Getting a {{fully loaded}} boat moving {{was not easy}} for the mules, and <b>overdriving</b> them, {{especially}} at the basin in Cumberland {{where there was no}} water current to help them move the boat, was common, resulting in many [...] mules. To get a loaded boat going, the mules would have to walk until the line was taut, then put their weight into it, and step once the boat had moved, and repeat this process. Within 25 feet, the boat would be moving.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, several guitarists {{experimented with}} {{producing}} distortion by deliberately <b>overdriving</b> amplifiers. These included Goree Carter, Joe Hill Louis, Elmore James, Ike Turner, Willie Johnson, Pat Hare, Guitar Slim, Chuck Berry, Johnny Burnette, and Link Wray. In the early 1960s, surf rock guitarist Dick Dale {{worked closely with}} Fender to produce custom made amplifiers, including the first 100-watt guitar amplifier. He pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing [...] "thick, clearly defined tones" [...] at [...] "previously undreamed-of volumes." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{came back}} {{early in the}} afternoon, and had an {{interview}} with his uncle in the library. The interview over, he left the house again, and was driven to the railway by the groom {{in time to catch}} the last train to London that night. The groom noticed, on the road, that [...] "Mr. George seemed to be rather pleased than otherwise at leaving St. Crux." [...] He also remarked, on his return, that the admiral swore at him for <b>overdriving</b> the horses--an indication of ill-temper, on the part of his master, which he described as being entirely without precedent in all his former experience. Magdalen, in her department of service, had suffered in like manner under the old man's irritable humor: he had been dissatisfied with everything she did in the dining-room; and he had found fault with all the dishes, one after another, from the mutton-broth to the toasted cheese.|$|E
60|$|Yonder old man {{carrying}} the block of stone which might tax the energies of a stout youth, {{and to whom}} a taskmaster has just administered a cut with the driving-whip, looks like one who has seen better days. Even in his ragged shirt, broken-brimmed straw hat, and naked feet, {{he looks like a}} gentleman. So he is; and there is a gentle lady and a stout son, and two sweet daughters, in Naples, who are toiling almost as hard as he does--if hours be allowed to count for pains--in order to make up his ransom. The strong bull-necked man that follows him with a hod of mortar is an unmistakable seaman of one of the Mediterranean ports. He is a desperate character, and in other lands might be dangerous; but he is safe enough here, for the bastinado is a terrible instrument of torture, and the man is now not only desperate in wrath, but is sometimes desperately frightened. His driver takes a fiendish pleasure in giving him an extra cut of the whip, just to make him apparently a willing horse, whether he will or not. The poor youth beside him is a very different character. His training has been more gentle, and his constitution less robust, for he has broken down under the cruel toil, and is evidently in the last stages of consumption. The taskmaster does not now interfere with him as he was wont to do when he first arrived. He knows that the day is not far distant when neither the bastinado nor any other species of torture will have power to force work out of him. He also knows that <b>overdriving</b> will only shorten the days of his usefulness; he therefore wisely lets him stagger by unmolested, with his light load.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overdriving</b> {{is done by}} {{rewiring}} lamp fixtures {{to increase}} lamp current; however, lamp life is reduced, and modifications of factory lamp wiring void all safety approvals such as UL or CSA.|$|E
5000|$|As we {{increase}} this voltage, VGS, beyond Vt, we {{are said}} to be then <b>OVERDRIVING</b> the gate by creating a stronger channel, hence the OVERDRIVE VOLTAGE (Called often Vov, Vod, or Von) is defined as (VGS − Vt) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{clipping}} {{caused by}} <b>overdriving</b> an audio amplifier {{is a simple}} example of this method, changing a sine wave into a square-like wave. (Note that direct digital implementations suffer from aliasing of the clipped signal's infinite number of harmonics, however.) ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the player}} presses the attack button, their {{character}}'s [...] "Overdrive" [...] gauge will fill up. Once full, the character will enter an [...] "Overdrive" [...] state, where their attack power is increased. However, once the player {{can no longer}} attack, their character will fall into an [...] "Overheat" [...] state, rendering them unable to attack until the gauge lowers {{enough for them to}} attack again. Players can use this gauge to their advantage by using [...] "Chain Drives"—the process of <b>Overdriving</b> one character into Overheat, immediately switching to another character already present, then <b>Overdriving</b> them as well. This frees both members' Overdrive gauges, enabling both to attack without hindrance. Players can also use Solo and Co-op Techniques, which unleash devastating combination attacks on their target.|$|E
50|$|High {{frequency}} response {{can also be}} enhanced through generation of harmonics. Instead of mapping frequencies inside the reproducible region of the speaker, the speaker itself is used to generate frequencies outside the normal reproducible region. By boosting high frequencies and <b>overdriving</b> the speaker or amplifier slightly, higher harmonics can be generated.|$|E
50|$|Crystals have no {{inherent}} failure mechanisms; {{some have}} operated in devices for decades. Failures may be, however, introduced by faults in bonding, leaky enclosures, corrosion, frequency shift by aging, breaking the crystal by too high mechanical shock, or radiation-induced damage when nonswept quartz is used. Crystals can be also damaged by <b>overdriving.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Gain {{compression}} is {{a reduction}} in [...] "differential" [...] or [...] "slope" [...] gain caused by nonlinearity of the transfer function of the amplifying device. This nonlinearity {{may be caused by}} heat due to power dissipation or by <b>overdriving</b> the active device beyond its linear region. It is a large-signal phenomenon of circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Some metal bassists {{play with}} a fuzz bass tone, which is {{obtained}} by <b>overdriving</b> the bass signal. Cliff Burton of Metallica used fuzz bass. Lemmy Kilmister, the bassist for Motörhead, obtains a natural fuzz bass tone by <b>overdriving</b> his twin 100 watt Marshall Bass stacks. Fuzz bass can also be obtained with a bass overdrive pedal or an [...] "overdrive" [...] or distortion effect built into their bass amp. The Peavey Century 200 has an onboard [...] "distortion" [...] effect on the second channel. The Peavey VB-2 also has built-in overdrive. Aguilar Amplification's AG 500 bass head is a two-channel amplifier, one of which offers a [...] "saturation" [...] control for overdrive. Metal bassists may also use other effects to alter their bass sound, such as a wah pedal (e.g., Cliff Burton) or an audio compressor to smooth out the sound.|$|E
50|$|Often an {{artifact}} is deliberately produced for creative reasons. For example {{to introduce a}} change in timbre of the original sound or {{to create a sense}} of cultural or stylistic context. A well-known example is the <b>overdriving</b> of an electric guitar or electric bass signal to produce a clipped, distorted guitar tone or fuzz bass.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum tube or [...] "valve" [...] {{distortion}} {{is achieved}} by [...] "overdriving" [...] the valves in an amplifier. In layperson's terms, <b>overdriving</b> is pushing the tubes beyond their normal rated maximum. Valve amplifiers—particularly those using class-A triodes—tend to produce asymmetric soft clipping that creates both even and odd harmonics. The increase in even harmonics is considered to create [...] "warm"-sounding overdrive effects.|$|E
50|$|Distortion and Overdrive {{circuits}} each 'clip' {{the signal}} {{before it reaches}} the main amplifier (Clean Boost circuits do not create 'clipping') as well as boost signals to levels that cause distortion to occur at the main amplifier's front end stage (by exceeding the ordinary input signal amplitude, thus <b>overdriving</b> the amplifier) Note : product names may not accurately reflect type of circuit involved - see above.|$|E
50|$|Response time {{compensation}} by voltage <b>overdriving</b> {{as currently}} applied in many LCD panels with 120 Hz frame frequency {{for improvement of}} the display of moving images in LCD TVs could become obsolete since the Blue Phase mode features a superior response speed (in the range of 10 - 100 microseconds, see ref. 1), allowing images to be reproduced at 240 Hz frame rate or higher {{without the need for}} any overdrive circuit.|$|E
50|$|With tube guitar amplifiers, it {{is often}} {{desirable}} to produce distortion by <b>overdriving</b> the output stage. Under such a condition, the amplifier will produce at or near its maximum output power. The resulting volume level, however, may be considered unsuitable for many playing conditions. By {{reducing the amount of}} power delivered to the speaker, power attenuators reduce to desired levels the volume of sound produced by the amplifier, without altering the quality of the tone that is being sought.|$|E
5000|$|Fuzz bass, {{also called}} [...] "bass overdrive" [...] or [...] "bass distortion", is {{a style of}} playing the {{electric}} bass or modifying its signal that produces a buzzy, distorted, overdriven sound, which the name implies in an onomatopoetic fashion. <b>Overdriving</b> a bass signal significantly changes the timbre, adds higher overtones (harmonics), increases the sustain, and, if the gain is turned up high enough, creates a [...] "breaking up" [...] sound characterized by a growling, buzzy tone.|$|E
50|$|Getting a {{fully loaded}} boat moving {{was not easy}} for the mules, and <b>overdriving</b> them, {{especially}} at the basin in Cumberland {{where there was no}} water current to help them move the boat, was common, resulting in many spavined mules. To get a loaded boat going, the mules would have to walk until the line was taut, then put their weight into it, and step once the boat had moved, and repeat this process. Within 25 feet, the boat would be moving.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overdriving</b> a {{fluorescent}} lamp {{is a method}} of getting more light from each tube than is obtained under rated conditions. ODNO (Overdriven Normal Output) fluorescent tubes are generally used when there isn't enough room to put in more bulbs to increase the light. The method is effective, but generates some additional issues. This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost-effective way to add more light to their aquariums. While power compact fluorescent lights cost upwards of $60-100 in the US, a twin bulb overdriven lamp {{can be set up}} for $30.|$|E
5000|$|Hardcore bassists use varied rhythms {{in their}} basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines {{that would be}} hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick. [...] Some bassists {{emphasize}} a very technical style of bass playing, such as the Minutemen's bassist Mike Watt, whoIron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson has called one of his [...] "all-time favourites", as he praises Watt's [...] "complex basslines". Some bassists play fuzz bass by <b>overdriving</b> their bass tone.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "acid" [...] {{sound is}} {{typically}} produced by playing a repeating note {{pattern on the}} TB-303, while altering the filter's cutoff frequency, resonance, and envelope modulation. The TB-303's accent control modifies a note's volume, filter resonance, and envelope modulation, allowing further variations in timbre. A distortion effect, either by using a guitar effects pedal or <b>overdriving</b> the input of an audio mixer, is commonly used to give the TB-303 a denser, noisier timbre—as the resulting sound is much richer in harmonics. Popular pedals include pedals by Boss and DOD Electronics pedals like the Grunge or Death Metal.|$|E

50|$|Psychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists {{may play}} punk-style power chords one moment, and then shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or {{by using the}} tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice.

5000|$|In some cases, the chord {{progression}} {{is implied}} with a simplified sequence {{of two or}} three notes, sometimes called a [...] "riff", that is repeated throughout the composition. In heavy metal (or just [...] "metal") music, this is typically expanded to more complex sequences comprising a combination of chords, single notes and palm muting. The rhythm guitar part in compositions performed by more technically oriented bands often include riffs employing complex lead guitar techniques. In some genres, especially metal, the audio signal from the rhythm guitar's output is often subsequently heavily distorted by <b>overdriving</b> the guitar's amplifier to create a thicker, [...] "crunchier" [...] sound for the palm-muted rhythms.|$|E
5000|$|Temperature dependence: LED {{performance}} largely {{depends on}} the ambient temperature of the operating environment - or thermal management properties. <b>Overdriving</b> an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. An adequate heat sink is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures, which require low failure rates. Toshiba has produced LEDs with an operating temperature range of −40 to 100 °C, which suits the LEDs for both indoor and outdoor use in applications such as lamps, ceiling lighting, street lights, and floodlights.|$|E
