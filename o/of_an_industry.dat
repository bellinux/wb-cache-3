5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

40|$|The present paper applies empirically the {{methodology}} of backward and forward R & D multipliers for the case of Greece, which, despite its high growth rates in output (G. D. P.), ranks last among European Union (E. U) countries in R&D expenditure. The backward R&D multipliers measure {{the total amount of}} R&D expenditure embodied in one unit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry’s</b> final demand. On the other hand, forward multipliers reflect the percentage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry’s</b> R&D expenditures that is embodied in the final output categories. The results show that the Greek economy experiences a decrease in backward R&D multipliers over the time period 1993 – 1997, and some policy implications are discussed, regarding the country’s priority to increase R&D diffusion and stimulate R&D financing.

25|$|Since 1995 the {{situation}} has improved. After the year 2000, annual ticket sales rose to 20 million and since 1995, the number of theatres has steadily increased to approximately 500 nationwide. Currently, Turkish films attract audiences of millions of viewers and routinely top the blockbuster lists, often surpassing foreign films at the box office. However, {{it is difficult to}} speak about the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry,</b> since most films are rather individual projects of directors who otherwise earn their living in television, advertising or theatre. The distribution of these films are mainly handled by multinational corporations such as Warner Bros. and United International Pictures.|$|E

As part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> team led by Northrop, Boeing built the outboard portion of the B-2 stealth bomber wing, the aft center fuselage section, landing gear, fuel system and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew {{for the first time}} on July 17, 1989.|$|E

The process of decomposition was still poorly understood and it was generally believed that (92%) of a decaying corpse was dispersed as gas; local authorities {{in the vicinity of the}} proposed new cemeteries were horrified at the prospect of an estimated [...] per year of miasma (disease-carrying vapour) spreading from the cemeteries across surrounding areas.

500|$|Don't Starve was {{developed}} and published by indie studio Klei Entertainment. The game began development {{as part of a}} 48-hour game jam in 2010. The team liked the idea but shelved it until two years later, when they had the time to flesh it out. Full development commenced in 2012, while Klei was nearing the end of the development process of Mark of the Ninja. This was during the heat <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> trend of creating games in which players are dropped into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival. The torch of this movement was held by the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft. Member Kevin Forbes stated in an interview that Minecraft was one of the team's biggest influences, particularly its exploration elements. However, as the game was conceived as a [...] "weird experiment", the team's main goal was to innovate in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, specifically by adding a layer of emphasis on characterization and themes. Another influence was the 2005 Nintendo DS title Lost in Blue, which contains similar supernatural elements and a day/night cycle.|$|E

40|$|July 11, 1995 In {{contrast}} to recent work in Regional Economics which emphasizes the role <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry's</b> scale in generating agglomeration economies, this paper {{emphasizes the importance}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry's</b> composition, that is, the number of firms generating agglomeration economies. As most recent work in this area, we assume that production {{is characterized by the}} use of non-tradable intermediate goods produced with decreasing average costs. Concentration leads to competition for inputs among final good producers, and thus provides a governance structure that mitigates the commitment problem intrinsic in the relationship between the intermediate goods' suppliers and final good producers. Hence, the paper establishes a link between the number of firms in the <b>industry</b> in <b>a</b> particular region, variety of industry-specific inputs, production costs, transaction costs, and producers' profits. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the scale effect and the composition effect can re-enforce each other. The paper's theoretical framework is applied to examine the concentration of the automobile industry in Michigan. ...|$|R
