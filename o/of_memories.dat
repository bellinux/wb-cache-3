40|$|In this paper, I {{deal with}} the {{constructive}} and dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> formation and with the nature <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> belief, whether a memory belief reflects the real past experience or a modified memory representation. That is I grapple {{with the issue of}} whether such a belief adheres to the final stage <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> or reflects the whole constructive process <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> After examining the multiple-trace and reconsolidation theories <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> I conclude that recent findings in neuroscience fundamentally disturb conventional notions <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> belief, since beliefs do not reflect the reconstructive processes episodic and autobiographical memories go through...|$|R

In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, primarily because <b>of</b> <b>memories</b> of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which had caught the authorities off-guard.

5|$|Development {{plans for}} Kingdom Hearts II began around the {{completion}} of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One such obstacle was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more, which required Disney's approval. The game was developed by Square Enix's Product Development Division-1, {{with most of the}} original staff from the first game. The game was originally supposed to have been released after Kingdom Hearts. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> was developed. To explain the loss of all the abilities from the first game at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura had Sora's memories scrambled in Kingdom Hearts: Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is without}} {{question}} that our memory system evolved {{through a process}} of natural selection. However, basic research into the evolutionary foundations <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> has begun in earnest only recently. This is quite peculiar as the majority, perhaps even all, <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> research relates to whether memory is adaptive or not. In this Special Issue <b>of</b> <b>Memory</b> we have assembled a variety of papers that represent the cutting edge in research on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> These papers are centred on issues about the ultimate and proximate explanations <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> the development <b>of</b> the adaptive functions <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> as well as the positive consequences that arise from the current evolutionary form that our memory has taken. In this introductory article we briefly outline these different areas and indicate why they are vital for a more complete theory <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> Further we argue that, by adopting a more applied stance {{in the area of the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> one <b>of</b> the many future directions in this field could be a new branch of psychology that addresses questions in evolutionary legal psychology...|$|R

5|$|The card-based {{gameplay}} of Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> {{would later}} serve to inspire the gameplay of Jupiter's next game, The World Ends with You; originally, the team envisioned a similar card game-based system {{taking place on}} the lower screen of the Nintendo DS, but eventually this morphed to a battle system taking place on both screens, with a card game controlled on the upper screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} an {{intermediary}} title was developed after director Tetsuya Nomura {{and his team}} {{had already begun to}} develop ideas for the second Kingdom Hearts game, which he had intended to be set a year after the original. Originally titled Kingdom Hearts: Lost Memories, Nomura changed the name to match the overall outline of the story, while still reflecting the theme <b>of</b> <b>memories.</b> Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> was developed {{to bridge the gap between}} Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Like most sequels, Kingdom Hearts II was planned to have the character start from the beginning, ability-wise. To explain the loss of abilities gained in the previous game, Nomura had the story revolve around Sora's memories getting corrupted and implemented the card battle system to symbolize Sora's various memories.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum.

A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories.</b> The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E
