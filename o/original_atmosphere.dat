500|$|The {{music for}} Persona {{was written by}} Hidehito Aoki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Misaki Okibe and Shoji Meguro. Persona was Tsuchiya and Meguro's first major work, with Meguro {{beginning}} shortly before he officially joined Atlus' internal staff. Meguro worked on the title for approximately a year, composing ten to {{twenty percent of the}} score. The first piece composed by Meguro was [...] "The Aria of the Soul", the theme for the Velvet Room, originally commissioned by Aoki. [...] "The Aria of the Soul" [...] would become a mainstay in future Persona titles. For the PSP re-release, Meguro composed new music alongside remixing original tracks. While he kept the <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> he also used the experience and musical techniques gained from his work on Persona 3 and 4. He also tried some new techniques, such as with the opening theme, which began with a pop motif before transitioning into heavy metal, along with changing the important lyrics from English to Japanese.|$|E
500|$|According to {{designer}} Ben Schneider, {{the basic}} story was {{built around the}} recurring motif in multiple mythologies where a younger generation of deities defeat older primal beings, with the main premise being that victory being overturned. They stayed within their mythological subject matter rather than straying into historical events: {{this was due to}} an incident during the release of Age of Empires where the developers needed to cut a scenario showing Korean people coming under attack from invading Japanese due to potential political and popular backlash in both countries. The game's story and script were written by Randall Wallace, a screenwriter who had written recent successful films Braveheart and Pearl Harbor. Titan Quest was his first time writing for a video game. Together with Iron Lore staff, Wallace created a story where humans and the Olympians faced both the Titans and the mythical beasts allied with them that had retreated to the forgotten parts of the world. According to Wallace, Iron Lore wanted story to be a priority in contrast to most other video games, with the player experience focusing on growing their character and learning the world's lore from NPCs. Speaking about his experience writing for the game compared to his work on films, he needed to work within more rigid guidelines and the need to make the story fit in with the gameplay and content. This meant that some scenarios needed to be cut either due to budget limitations or some sequences working so well that they were extended. A major change from his writing for films was that it was the side characters rather than the main character that drove the story forward, so he needed to make them entertaining and important to furthering the plot. The team wanted a world with a scope beyond the main story, with material covering all of its locations. They also included NPC storytellers that would relate local legends and myths to the player in a similar way to storytellers of the time. Later, lead gameplay designer Arthur Bruno faulted the presentation as unappealing compared to the version of Greek mythology portrayed by God of War series, saying that the <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere</b> [...] "was seriously lacking a sense of dread and mystery".|$|E
50|$|Initial {{atmospheric}} composition is generally {{related to the}} chemistry and temperature of the local solar nebula during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases. The <b>original</b> <b>atmospheres</b> started with the radially local rotating gases that collapsed to the spaced rings that formed the planets.

2500|$|Several liberties {{were taken}} in {{adapting}} Tolkien's weaponry and armour to the screen. While plate armour {{is used in the}} films, it is unmentioned in any of the author's writings (except for vambraces), where scale and especially mail predominate. Some swords, like the broken royal sword Narsil, are also interpreted as two-handed longswords. These design choices help evoke the Late Medieval and Renaissance periods, whereas Tolkien's <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is generally more akin to the Early Medieval period. In a private letter he compared Middle-earth clothing and war gear to that of Dark Age Europe and the Bayeux Tapestry. Weta also invented Elvish inscriptions for weapons like the spear Aeglos and the swords Sting and Narsil. In some cases Tolkien writes about runes on sword blades but does not give them in detail. The Elves use curved swords, whereas the author mostly assigns such swords to Orcs and enemy Men (he writes about one Elf bearing a curved sword in very early writings). The designers {{went so far as to}} invent new weapons, such as the Elvish sword Hadhafang, used by Arwen; while the design is original the name is derived from Tolkien's [...] "Etymologies" [...] in The Lost Road.|$|E

40|$|It was {{suggested}} that heating and/or vaporization of accreting carbonaceous-chondrite-type planetestimals {{could result in}} the release of their volatile components. Modeling of this process strongly suggests that substantial atmospheres/hydrospheres could develop this way. During most of the accretionary process, impact velocities generally differed from the escape velocity of the growing proto-planet because most of the collisions were between bodies in nearly matching orbits. Toward the end of accretion, however, collisions were rarer but more energetic, involving large planetestimals and higher impact velocities. Such impacts result in a net loss of atmosphere from a planet, and the cumulative effect impacts during the period of heavy bombardment might have dramatically depleted the <b>original</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Models developed to study atmospheric erosion by impacts on Mars and the interaction of the vapor plume produced by KT impactor on Earth are applied to the case of the evolution of Earth's atmosphere...|$|R

50|$|One {{mechanism}} for sequestration is chemical; for example, {{most of the}} carbon dioxide of the Earth's <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere</b> has been chemically sequestered into carbonate rock.

40|$|It is now {{admitted}} that very large impacts {{may have played}} an important role in the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The size-frequency distribution of these impacts fits the formal definition of a catastrophic process: the mass and momentum added by a rare large impact is larger than that added by all the more frequent small impacts combined. The effects of such large impacts on the thermal states of growing planets is discussed. At a later stage of planetary evolution, the smaller impacts during late heavy bombardment may have {{played an important role}} in stripping the <b>original</b> gaseous <b>atmospheres</b> of the planets and in segregating condensible substances from volatile ones...|$|R

50|$|The {{park was}} deeded {{to the city}} in 1870 by {{prominent}} citizen George F. Comstock. Walnut Park is itself a three-block long park. The long sides of the park are bordered on the west by Walnut Place, on the east by Walnut Avenue. Cross streets are Harrison Street, Adams Street, Marshall Street, and Waverly Avenue from north to south. The park was originally landscaped with shade trees, but the Dutch Elm disease wiped out that overall effect in the 1950s. In 1972, new trees were planted. These trees have reached maturity and restored some of the <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to the park.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} way {{to exchange}} {{the atmosphere of}} a Schlenk flask is to use one or more [...] "vac-refill" [...] cycles, typically using a vacuum-gas manifold, {{also known as a}} Schlenk line. This involves pumping the air out of the flask and replacing the resulting vacuum with an inert gas. For example, evacuation of the flask to 1 mm and then replenishing the atmosphere with 760 mm inert gas leaves 0.13% of the <b>original</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (1/760 &times; 100%). Two such vac-refill cycles leaves 0.000173% (i.e. 1/7602 &times; 100%). Most Schlenk lines easily and quickly achieve a vacuum of 1 mm Hg.|$|E

5000|$|By the 19th century, Luwu {{had become}} a backwater. James Brooke, later Rajah of Sarawak, wrote in the 1830s that ‘Luwu is the oldest Bugis state, and the most decayed ... Palopo is a miserable town, {{consisting}} of about 300 houses, scattered and dilapidated ... It is {{difficult to believe that}} Luwu could ever have been a powerful state, except in a very low state of native civilisation.’ In the 1960s Luwu was a focus of an Islamic rebellion led by Kahar Muzakkar. Today the former kingdom is home to the world’s largest nickel mine and is experiencing an economic boom fueled by inward migration, yet it still retains much of its <b>original</b> frontier <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All these bands had {{achieved}} critical acclaim in many underground quarters, since their releases were distributed from inception {{in the late}} 1980s in Europe, USA, {{and as far as}} New Zealand. So STCA became an experimental band, using instruments that were never featured, or had little prominence in the other bands, but most distinctively, the total lack of electric guitars and standard drum sets. Heavily relying on keyboards and varied percussion, and bass as a leading improvisational force, the band released first eponymous album in 1996. They succeeded in sounding totally different from previous recordings, creating <b>original</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and landscapes with an acoustic twist. Though some fans felt that Beltran and Basurto had lost direction, the album did gain them a new following. At the same time Humus and Frolic Froth continued active with the preparation of follow up albums for both bands, in their own unique psychedelic and heavy styles. It was during a European tour of Humus in 1997 that Victor Basurto settled in the Netherlands, but that wasn't and hasn't been an impediment for both musicians to continue collaborating, recording and releasing albums, with the constant mail-exchange of tapes. It was through this fashion that all their records since then have been produced, including a second album by STCA recorded in 1999 named Animated Weigtlessness (released 2002), which went even farther than the first in the difficult task of trying to categorize it. The album got rave reviews in yet new international quarters, many of them not even linking STCA to Beltran and Basurto's other [...] "established" [...] acts. Animated Weightlessness was released in own independent label Nuggetphase.|$|R

50|$|All {{vestiges of}} old {{architecture}} have been wiped {{off in the}} adjoining session chamber by renovations in 1879-1910. The chamber is dominated by two large canvases, the work of painter Václav Brožík. One represents Master Jan Hus's courageous defence before the Council of Constance in 1415 and the second one the election of Jiří of Podebrady in 1458. More interesting and historically valuable is the adjoining Jiřík hall in the late-Gothic style with remnants of the wall paintings dating {{from the end of}} the 15th century. The work of restoration carried out by P.

Today the resort mixes wealthy family villas, luxury hotels and seaside apartment buildings, creating an <b>original</b> and unique <b>atmosphere</b> of social diversity. The nearby region has long been an area of contact and conflict between Breton culture and that of the neighbouring Loire valley, and consequently is rich with historic places, castles (Nantes castle), walled cities (Guerande), not to mention 19th century seaside resorts, such as Quiberon, and many typical Breton fishing villages (Le Croisic, Pornichet).|$|R
500|$|When {{developing}} Shadow Dragon, {{the team}} {{did not see}} it as a simple remake, but rather a [...] "renewal" [...] of the original on a new platform with new and updated mechanics. The most difficult part was balancing this with maintaining the <b>original</b> version's <b>atmosphere.</b> Numerous features were added to the experience, such as displays for movement and attack range, the ability to change classes and unit recruitment if too many of the original army fell in battle. Expanded difficulty options and tutorials were also added to help ease newcomers into the series. The by-then well established Weapon Triangle was also introduced, replacing the unbalanced systems from the original. The addition of a single mid-battle save was intended to help ease newcomers into the series, so they would not need to restart the entire battle if a key unit fell. The dual screen display of both map and unit placement and status was indirectly inspired by the original version, which allowed players to view character stats without dropping out of the map.|$|R
