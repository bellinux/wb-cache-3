5|$|After its {{removal from}} <b>Operation</b> Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was <b>Operation</b> Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the <b>operation</b> would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the <b>operation</b> once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} <b>operation.</b> Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. <b>Operation</b> Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the <b>operation</b> got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the <b>operation</b> was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. <b>Operation</b> Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The <b>operation</b> was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E
