25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and <b>our</b> <b>need</b> to think for ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Stratton {{also contributed}} to the {{psychological}} study of religion. Along with other founders of the psychology of religion, he saw religion as including both personal faith and historical traditions. He used religious texts as supporting data. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he explored the epics and sacred texts of a large set of ethnicities to understand the traditions and rituals symbolizing the concrete parts of faiths to understand the goals and concept of religion as a whole. [...] His psychology sought to explain how <b>our</b> <b>need</b> to grasp, accept and live with conceptual opposites such as the sublime and the devilish, the humble and the proud, and the docile and the energetic, led us in the direction of religion. He also tied human emotions, especially anger and pugnacity, to religious faith. To understand the linkage, Stratton collected data on religious writings and the rites and traditions of civilizations then considered not as advanced. In Anger: Its Religious and Moral Significance he listed exhaustively and studied the major religions of the world and classified them into three categories. The combative religions, such as Islam, per him, glorified anger, while those such as Buddhism were [...] "unangry". Christianity he saw as an example of an anger-supported-love based religion. He concluded Western civilization was trending toward denying rage as good and accepting love and goodwill as desirable, but cautioned anger was at times needed to fight evil.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode {{and gave it}} an A. He applauded {{the fact that it}} [...] "lets Scully be flawed" [...] and allowed her to be [...] "far more human" [...] than usual on the show. Handlen concluded that the episode was a success because it illustrated [...] "the way <b>our</b> <b>need</b> to connect with others makes us vulnerable". He was, however, critical of Mulder's actions in the episode, calling him a [...] "spoiled ass" [...] and noted that there was a [...] "little boy ignored feel to his dialogue at the end". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "one of the best character studies of the entire series". He concluded that [...] "Much of Scully’s underlying psychology is explored in this episode, and in keeping with what has been revealed about Mulder, it’s not pretty. The final act doesn’t quite match the intensity of the third, but it’s rather clear what the writers were trying to convey." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com wrote positively of the episode and noted that [...] "t is fortunate, I think, that the Super Bowl forced the change in sequence." [...] She argued that, had “Leonard Betts” not aired before [...] "Never Again", the audience would have been forced to [...] "read her actions as reactions to Mulder and Mulder alone" [...] rather than against the fact that she has cancer.|$|E

[...] In the famous poem [...] "Carmel Point," [...] Jeffers called on humans to [...] "uncenter" [...] themselves. In [...] "The Double Axe," [...] Jeffers explicitly described inhumanism as [...] "a shifting of emphasis and significance from man to notman; the rejection of human solipsism and recognition of the trans-human magnificence. ... This manner of thought and feeling is neither misanthropic nor pessimist. ... It offers a reasonable detachment as rule of conduct, instead of love, hate and envy ... it provides magnificence for the religious instinct, and satisfies <b>our</b> <b>need</b> to admire greatness and rejoice in beauty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{violence}} and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen {{in light of the}} short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature [...] "religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor." [...] Discussing [...] "the connection between violence and redemption," [...] Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers [...] "of the powerful force of evil in the world and of <b>our</b> <b>need</b> for grace," [...] Tarantino [...] "seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything {{we have seen in the}} film— all {{the violence}}, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior— grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits." ...|$|E

She and the director, Alice Reagan, held salons where people could share their own personal stories of reunion as part of The Tuesday Following. The play follows Maia who was saved by her mother’s sacrifice in a Tsunami and how she reunited with her father who was distraught by her mother’s death.

2500|$|A {{protectionistic}} {{measure for}} improving the GLONASS user segment was proposed by Vladimir Evtushenkov main shareholder of JFSC Sistema. In a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Evtushenkov called for an import ban on all the GPS-capable devices unless these devices support Glonass as well. Evtushenkov claimed that Russian authorities had already started negotiations with major vendors like Nokia, Siemens and Motorola. [...] Vladimir Putin agreed that [...] "It is good that our partners understand <b>our</b> <b>need</b> to protect our national interests and promote our product". According to Russian experts, {{it was possible that}} mobile devices like smartphones would be effectively banned as well. Some producers claimed that if additional expenses to add GLONASS were too high, they may consider turning off satnav feature in devices for Russian market to avoid import ban.|$|E

Riccitiello stated that Criterion Games, {{developers}} of EA's own Burnout series, {{was working on}} a [...] "revolutionary" [...] addition to the Need for Speed franchise, stating: [...] "We don't have a plan right now for a separate major launch on Burnout, because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on Need for Speed." [...] The title was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June 2009, where he stated: [...] "We've taken the Burnout team and combined it with <b>our</b> <b>Need</b> for Speed franchise. So we now have that in our favor because that Burnout team {{is probably one of the}} more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion." [...] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, expressed his delight to work with Criterion Games, stating that it would be a [...] "great team to work with on that stuff," [...] referencing the development of Need for Speed. [...] It was reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010. EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer. According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.|$|E
