He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we think of <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E

[...] Marcotte noted that the [...] "Resistance" [...] is lead, for the audience, by two women in Johnson and Simmons, reflecting the 2017 Women's March, and also that Hydra gained power using fear of Inhumans just as [...] "Trump was able to ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into power". She also highlighted Simmons' warning to a young boy that all Hydra agent are Nazis, calling this a warning [...] "to the audience, reminding them not to forget exactly what kind of authoritarian monster has been put in the White House." [...] Michal Schick of Hypable noted that the political commentary had been running throughout the season, with Nadeer and the Humans First movement, but that [...] "in the face of murderous demons with combustable craniums and body-swapping LMD’s, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. largely kept the commentary in the background. That changed—drastically—as the show entered" [...] the final pod. Schick highlighted the fact that [...] "for all of the clear allusions to Trump’s America, the president himself remains unparodied. The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to imagine a more different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida. But an element of individual responsibility burns through, both in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> and in this fiction." ...|$|E

Such involvement of the ‘consumer’ is generally claimed to provide a counter-narrative to the psychiatric and medical paradigm of illness. Taking a critical and reflexive standpoint, we find ourselves asking: Is there a dark side to employing person-centred approaches and potential loss and risk to participants themselves? To explore these questions further we undertook a condensed critique of the current mental health, health and social care policy arena. We then move to methodological concerns about ways in which person-centred research, including <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> can inadvertently reproduce the neoliberalist agenda. To conclude, we offer <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> experiences as a cautionary tale. We also posit that a post-Foucauldian governmentality framework can assist researchers to avoid contributing to the very problems we wish to resolve...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives?</b> Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time.

2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, however, a few critics {{were willing to}} {{consider}} Marston as a writer who {{was very much in}} control of the world he creates. T. S. Eliot saw that this [...] "irregular demesne" [...] was a part of Marston's world and declared that [...] "It is … by giving us the sense of something behind, more real than any of the personages and their action, that Marston establishes himself among the writers of genius". [...] Marston's tragic style is Senecan and although his characters may appear, on Eliot's own admission, [...] "lifeless", they are instead used as types to convey their [...] "theoretical implications". Eliot in particular admired Sophonisba and saw how Marston's plays, with their apparently stylised characters and bitter portrayal of a world where virtue and honour only arouse [...] "dangerous envy" [...] (Sophonisba; Act 1, scene 1, line 45) in those around them, actually bring to life [...] "a pattern behind the pattern into which the characters deliberately involve themselves: the kind of pattern which we perceive in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> only at rare moments of inattention and detachment".|$|E
2500|$|Just as Tyler is {{difficult}} to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her “style without a style” manages to pull the reader into the story: “So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.” [...] The San Francisco Chronicle made a similar point: “One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading {{into a kind of}} transport.” [...] Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: “You’re involved before you ever notice you were paying attention.” Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of The Amateur Marriage, perhaps described the phenomenon best: “When the realistic novel works its magic, you won’t simply have read about the experiences of ﬁctitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; your knowledge of their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time. The experience of reading such ﬁction when it’s carefully composed can be breathtaking, like being given the magical power of reliving passages of <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> indecipherable at the time of being lived.” ...|$|E

40|$|In this article, we problematize {{a common}} {{assumption}} (embodied in everyday practices of schooling) that learning (standard) English {{as a second}} language corresponds to acquiring a new code. Rather, by drawing on various literatures (poetry, postmodern writing, and [sociological] phenomenology) and <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> experience of learning English later in life, we show how acquiring a new language leads to changing experiences of Self and Other. Because some research has shown that speakers of non-standard English experience clashes (symbolic violence) when they confront the standard registers of English at school, we extend our analysis to non-standard English as primary language. We call for a notion of literacy that allows students to negotiate dialects, registers, and with it, their constructions of Self and Other. You ask me what I mean by saying I have lost my tongue. I ask you, {{what would you do if}} you had two tongues in your mouth, and lost the first one, the mother tongue...|$|R

We use the interrelationship between different feminisms in the context of our lived experiences as a mother and daughter whose experience of the academy has crossed, in the language of waves that of second wave feminism into third wave. It also bridges the mainstreaming of women’s studies in many universities, and claims of post feminism. By focusing upon trajectories of change both within the specificities of <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> experience and the wider terrain of social change, albeit often marked more by continuities than transformation, we examine the particularities of life in higher education in the different roles than we have performed and which we each still have. There have been significant demographic, cultural and legislative shifts, for example within the culture and practice of equal opportunities, but our conversations demonstrate the endurance of imbalances of power and the continuing need for a feminist politics of difference which can engage with contemporary life in the academy with its intersecting axes of inequality...|$|R
