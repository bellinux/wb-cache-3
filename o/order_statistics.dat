40|$|Soft {{decision}} decoding {{of linear}} block codes based on <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics</b> {{is discussed in}} the context of multilevel coding with multistage decoding. Analytical expressions on the <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics</b> and the associated bit error probability have been derived. The result shows tradeoffs between error performance and decoding complexity in multilevel signaling including BPSK modulation formats as a special case. Keywords: linear block codes, <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics,</b> soft decision decoding, multistage decoding, bit error probability 1 I. Introduction BPSK modulation is commonly assumed in evaluating the peroformance of error correcting codes over AWGN/fading channels. However, for higher transmission rate, multilevel signaling like PSK or QAM modulation formats is an indispensable transmission technique over bandwidth limited channels. In this paper, we extend the soft decision decoding algorithm based on <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics</b> [1] to two levels of signaling {{in the context of}} multilevel coded mo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for efficiently determining the unwanted interfering samples in the reference window, for the <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics</b> constant false alarm rate detector, based on {{the application of the}} information theoretic criteria principle. The proposed processor termed as Forward Automatic <b>Order</b> Selection <b>Ordered</b> <b>Statistics</b> Detector (FAOSOSD) does not require any prior information about the number of interfering targets. The proposed design aims to improve the <b>Ordered</b> <b>Statistics</b> Constant False Alarm Rate detector performance under severe interference situations. The number of interfering targets is obtained by minimizing the information theoretic criteria. Simulation results that illustrate the performance of the proposed method versus the classical OS-CFAR, the AND-CFAR and the OR-CFAR detectors are presented and discussed. 1...|$|R

The algorithm combines the iterative decoding with <b>ordered</b> <b>statistics</b> decoding (OSD), where the CRC code and the turbo code are regarded as an integrated whole in the OSD process. Moreover, we propose an effective error detecting method based on normalized Euclidean distance {{to compensate for the}} loss of error detection capability which should have been provided by CRC.
