[1] Apparently inspired by a failed same-sex attachment and its psychological aftermath, 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 was neglected for forty years after Bowers reassembled the sequence from Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s surviving manuscripts for the 1860 Leaves. But it {{became the subject of}} critical and editorial controversy in the 1990 s, when Alan Helms printed the sequence from the revised 2 ̆ 2 Calamus 2 ̆ 2 versions of the twelve poems and Hershel Parker reprinted Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s edition from the manuscript, with both proponents defending their versions in the journal Nineteenth-Century Literature. [2] In that exchange, Parker 2 ̆ 7 s argument for the manuscript version prevailed, and Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s editorial approach has since become the standard model for reprintings—most recently Betsy Erkkila 2 ̆ 7 s version of the poems alongside photo-facsimile reproductions of the manuscript leaves (see note 1). Yet Erkkila 2 ̆ 7 s unqualified reference to the leaves as 2 ̆ 2 clean and elegantly handwritten 2 ̆ 2 (xii) typifies an ongoing failure by editors adequately to consider the state of the 2 ̆ 2 Live Oak 2 ̆ 2 manuscript. Whereas his initial inscription of this work can indeed be described as clean and elegant, Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s clear and present revisions to the leaves raise significant questions about the form of the sequence and his evolving intentions for its twelve poems. As I will demonstrate in this essay, Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s editorial focus on the final versions of the sundered manuscripts was not well suited for 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and it resulted in his incorporation of changes that Whitman made to the poems after breaking the sequence apart. Along with detailing the transmission of the sequence in manuscript, this essay concludes with an edition of 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 that restores the sequence to its original, integrated state. The restorative edition more accurately conveys the themes and intentions that inform 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and more clearly illustrates its significance in the development of Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s thought...|$|R

Whitman composed the 12 -poem 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 sequence in the late 1850 s, apparently {{in response to a}} failed same-sex attachment, and not with the intent to publish it. Yet that act of private commemoration prompted a major creative impulse that produced the 45 -poem 2 ̆ 2 Calamus 2 ̆ 2 cluster, thematically devoted to male comradeship, and his combination of old and new poems that would make up 2 ̆ 2 Children of Adam 2 ̆ 2 (originally 2 ̆ 2 Enfans d 2 ̆ 7 Adam), devoted to sex, procreation, and love of men for women. Whereas both of the larger clusters were printed in the third (1860) edition of Leaves of Grass, 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 was never published intact by Whitman, who instead dispersed and shuffled its 12 poems among the 33 other poems of 2 ̆ 2 Calamus, 2 ̆ 2 eliminating its narrative of love, loss, and resolution. In dismantling the shorter sequence Whitman canceled the most complex and moving account of love and heartache that had yet emerged within American literature.

40|$|Chloroatranol and atranol are {{degradation}} products of chloroatranorin and atranorin, respectively, and {{have recently been}} identified as important contact allergens in the natural fragrance extract, <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute. <b>Oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute is widely used in perfumery and {{is the cause of}} many cases of fragrance allergic contact dermatitis. Chloroatranol elicits reactions at very low levels of exposure. In <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute, chloroatranol and atranol are present together and both may contribute to the allergenicity and eliciting capacity of the natural extract. In this study, 10 eczema patients with known sensitization to chloroatranol and <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute were tested simultaneously to a serial dilution of chloroatranol and atranol in ethanol, in equimolar concentrations (0. 0034 - 1072 mu M).

Both substances elicited reactions at very low levels of exposure.

Recently, chloroatranol, a hitherto unknown fragrance allergen, was identified in <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute. The objective was to assess the clinical importance of chloroatranol as a fragrance allergen by characterizing its elicitation profile. 13 patients previously showing a positive patch test to <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute and chloroatranol were included, together with a control group of 10 patients without sensitization to either of the 2 materials. A serial dilution patch test was performed on the upper back with concentrations ranging from 200 to 0. 0063 p. p. m. of chloroatranol in ethanol. Simultaneously, the participant performed an open test simulating the use of perfumes on the volar aspect of the forearms in a randomized and double-blinded design. A solution with 5 p. p. m. chloroatranol was used for 14 days, and, in case of no reaction, the applications were continued for another 14 days with a solution containing 25 p. p. m. All test subjects (13 / 13) developed an allergic reaction at the site of application of the solution containing chloroatranol. Among them, 12 / 13 (92 %) gave a positive reaction to the 5 p. p. m. solution and 1 to 25 p. p. m. None of the controls reacted (P < 0. 001). The use test was terminated at median day 4. The dose eliciting a reaction in 50 % of the test subjects at patch testing was 0. 2 p. p. m. In conclusion, the hidden exposure to a potent allergen widely used in perfumes has caused a highly sensitized cohort of individuals. Judged from the elicitation profile, chloroatranol is the most potent allergen present in consumer products today...|$|E

It was also known locally as Jackson's, Plant's or Woodall's Moss, and {{was part of the}} Manor of Withington. In 1867, the area was given its own postcode by the post office - 'Manchester SW 16'. In 1894, the area north of the Black Brook was incorporated into the newly formed Stretford Urban District. With the sale of Manley Hall in 1905, a contiguous strip of land was added to the south and west of the estate for house building, formerly being a part of the parish of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Because all of this land was covered in peat from a thickness of eighteen inches to three feet, Samuel Brooks drained it, and initially built villas for wealthy businessmen such as himself. He was born near Whalley, Lancashire, after which he named his own home Whalley House, which may be the origin of the area's name. A toll gate guarded this exclusive area and this place (where Chorlton Road and Withington Road meet) is still called Brooks's Bar (pron. Brooks Bar). The toll-gate was first removed to the junction with Wood Road, and then the charging of tolls came to an end on 10 June 1896.|$|R
