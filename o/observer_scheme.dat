40|$|There are {{different}} schemes based on observers {{to detect and}} isolate faults in dynamic processes. In the case of fault diagnosis in instruments (FDI) there {{are different}} diagnosis schemes {{based on the number}} of observers: the Simplified <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (SOS) only requires one observer, uses all the inputs and only one output, detecting faults in one detector; the Dedicated <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (DOS), which again uses all the inputs and just one output, but this time there is a bank of observers capable of locating multiple faults in sensors, and the Generalized <b>Observer</b> <b>Scheme</b> (GOS) which involves a reduced bank of observers, where each observer uses all the inputs and m- 1 outputs, and allows the localization of unique faults. This work proposes a new scheme named Simplified Interval Observer SIOS-FDI, which does not requires the measurement of any input and just with just one output allows the detection of unique faults in sensors and because it does not require any input, it simplifies in an important way the diagnosis of faults in processes in which it is difficult to measure all the inputs, as in the case of biologic reactors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Advanced control schemes {{can be used}} to {{optimize}} energy production and cost of energy in modern wind turbines. These control schemes most often rely on wind speed estimations. These designs of wind speed estimators are, however, not designed to be fault tolerant towards faults in the used sensors. In this paper a fault tolerant wind speed estimator is designed based on a set of unknown input observers, each designed to the different sets of nonfaultysensors. Faultsintherotor,generatorandwindspeedsensorsareconsidered. Thedesigned wind speed estimator is passive tolerant towards faults in the wind speed sensors, and faults in the generator and rotor speed sensors are accommodated by an active fault tolerant <b>observer</b> <b>scheme</b> in which the faults are detected and identified, and the observer corresponding to the non-faulty sensors are used. The potential of the scheme is shown by applying the proposed wind speed estimator to a simulation model of a wind turbine.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} solve the fault {{detection}} and isolation problem, a diagnostic procedure is used. This procedure is composed of two steps: residuals generation followed by their evaluation within decision functions. Many ways {{have been developed to}} generate residuals. Among them, we quote the well known parity space approach and the observer based approach. These methods are known to produce structural equivalent residuals. As a consequence, one wonders which method to use in order to design a more robust on-line detection system. Besides, unknown input observers are known to be helpful, within Generalised <b>Observer</b> <b>Schemes,</b> to improve robustness with respect to systems uncertainties.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose {{a number of}} {{relevant}} engineering applications that exhibit both a continuous and a discrete evolution, and are therefore suitably described by a recent formalism for hybrid dynamical systems.

In the context of dynamical systems, we analyze the properties of these applications in terms of asymptotic stability through Lyapunov functions tailored for hybrid systems. Instead of the standard Lyapunov conditions, we prove asymptotic stability through weaker, or relaxed, conditions that are compensated by additional (structural) properties that may be easier to verify...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a functional observer based fault detection method. The fault detection is achieved using a functional observer based fault indicator that asymptotically converges {{to a fault}} indicator that can be derived based on the nominal system. The asymptotic value of the proposed fault indicator is independent of the functional observer parameters and also the convergence rate of the fault indicator can be altered by choosing appropriate functional observer parameters. The advantage of using this new method is that the observed system is not necessarily needed to be observable; therefore, the proposed fault detection technique is also applicable for systems where state observers cannot be designed; moreover, the functional <b>observer</b> fault detection <b>scheme</b> is always of reduced order in comparison to a state <b>observer</b> based <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{nonlinear}} optimal controller and <b>observer</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on}} a θ-D approximation approach for surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). By applying the θ-D method in both the controller and observer designs, the unsolvable Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations are switched to an algebraic Riccati equation and statedependent Lyapunov equations (SDLEs). Then, through selecting the suitable coefficient matrices, the SDLEs become algebraic, so the complex matrix operation technique, i. e., the Kronecker product applied in the previous papers to solve the SDLEs is eliminated. Moreover, the proposed technique not only solves the problem of controlling the large initial states, but also avoids the excessive online computations. By utilizing a more accurate approximation method, the proposed control system achieves superior control performance (e. g., faster transient response, more robustness under the parameter uncertainties and load torque variations) compared to the state-dependent Riccati equation-based control method and conventional PI controlmethod. The proposed observer-based control methodology is tested with an experimental setup of a PMSM servo drive using a Texas Instruments TMS 320 F 28335 DSP.
