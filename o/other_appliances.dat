The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth.

25|$|While the {{traditional}} {{characteristic of a}} fire appliance {{was a lack of}} water pumping or storage, many modern TLs have a water pumping function built in (and some have their own on-board supply reservoir), and may have a pre-piped waterway running the length of the ladder which directs a stream of water to the firefighters at the top. In some cases, there may also be a monitor {{at the top of the}} ladder for ease of use. <b>Other</b> <b>appliances</b> may simply have a track-way which will hold a manually-run hose reel securely, and prevent it from falling to the ground.|$|E
25|$|In January 1858 Charles Pierre Melly, a Liverpool philanthropist (an {{ancestor}} {{of the late}} George Melly, musician and entertainer, and Andrée Melly film actress) applied to purchase a piece of corporation land {{for the purpose of}} transforming it into a free recreative ground, and fitting it up with a gymnasium and <b>other</b> <b>appliances</b> {{for the use of the}} local working-class people.

25|$|Beginning in July 1974, Kallinger and his 15-year-old son Michael {{went on a}} crime spree {{spanning}} Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. Over {{the next}} six weeks, they robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused four families and murdered three people, gaining entrance to each house by pretending to be salesmen. On January 8, 1975, they continued their spree in Leonia, New Jersey. Using a pistol and a knife, they overpowered and tied up the three residents. Then, when others entered the home, {{they were forced to}} strip and bound with cords from lamps and <b>other</b> <b>appliances.</b> This culminated in the killing of 21-year-old nurse Maria Fasching, the eighth person to arrive, when she reprimanded Kallinger and he responded by slitting her throat. Finally, another of the residents, still bound, managed to get outside and cry for help. Neighbors saw her and called the police, but by the time they arrived the Kallingers had fled, using the city bus as their getaway vehicle and dumping their weapons and a bloody shirt along the way.|$|E

25|$|Income {{grants are}} argued to be vastly more {{efficient}} in extending basic needs {{to the poor}} than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and <b>other</b> <b>appliances,</b> the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that {{the money spent on}} in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.|$|E

[...] Because these devices removed the fear of conception, they were said to foster a [...] "positive invitation to illicit intercourse."
