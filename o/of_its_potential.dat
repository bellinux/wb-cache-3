5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E

5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major advocate {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda {{was adapted}} from a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} similar to a stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at silat (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich {{to give to the}} poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E
5|$|Three Amylostereum {{species are}} {{symbionts}} of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through {{the formation of}} asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A.areolatum–Sirex woodwasp (S.noctilio) symbiont complex has been studied extensively because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions.|$|E

5|$|Preceded by the {{publication}} of the re-mastered editions of their first four albums, Girlschool released the studio album Believe in July 2004. The wish to explore new territories is obvious in some tracks of the album, which is the first one entirely composed by the new line-up at Chambers’ home studio. The changed line-up brought a new balance in the band, with Chambers involved in the composition of all songs. Moreover, the chance to use again two lead singers led to improvements in the vocal and choral parts. Unfortunately, the album was poorly distributed and remained unknown to large parts <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> audience. In 2005, the band re-released Believe in a new package with a DVD containing footage taken from concerts of the 2000s and sold it through their official website. A US and European tour followed Believe first release, but the project for releasing in 2004 a live DVD tentatively titled Girlschool Live at the Garage never materialised. In June 2005, Girlschool did a UK tour with Vixen and another one in November–December with old pals Motörhead, celebrating Lemmy's band 30th anniversary. During the same year, they were also on stage at summer festivals in the Netherlands and England and opened for Alice Cooper in Spain.|$|E

By skipping second strand synthesis scAAV allows for rapid expression in the cell. Otherwise, scAAV carries many characteristics of its AAV counterpart.|$|E

25|$|However, {{unless a}} team can {{appropriately}} utilize the full capacity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential,</b> effectiveness can suffer. One {{factor in the}} effectiveness of team negotiation {{is a problem that}} occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.|$|E

A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point {{energy is}} {{fundamentally}} {{related to the}} Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative {{at a point in}} space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the potential well.|$|E

The company initiated an ambitious construction program, building the Bersimis-1, Bersimis-2, Carillon and the third phase of the Beauharnois generating stations to keep up. After commissioning the Beaumont generating station in 1958, the Shawinigan Water & Power Company had exhausted most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> for the significant expansion of hydropower on the Saint-Maurice River and turned to Hydro-Québec to secure additional supplies.
