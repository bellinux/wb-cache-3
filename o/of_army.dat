5|$|Following a {{visit of}} the {{commander}} of the Panzerjagdverbände (tank-hunting detachment) <b>of</b> <b>Army</b> Group Vistula, Oberst Ernst-Wilhelm Freiherr Gedult von Jungenfeld, all of the Panzerjagdverbände were to be centralized under Strachwitz' command.

Strachwitz deployed his men in small combat groups, sometimes operating behind Allied lines, which lured Soviet tanks into traps and attacked them with Panzerfausts. Combat reached its peak in April 1945, and some of his men were credited with more than ten enemy tanks destroyed each. The German front line <b>of</b> <b>Army</b> Group Centre at the time was in mid-Silesia along the Zobten, and via Schweidnitz and Jauer to Lauban. The main Soviet thrust was towards Berlin and Dresden, threatening the German troops in Silesia with encirclement. Strachwitz and his men fought under the command of Schörner until the German capitulation on 8 May 1945.|$|E
