Whale gathered as many of those as he could who had been involved in one production <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> the musical, including Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, Charles Winninger, Sammy White, conductor Victor Baravalle, orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett, and, as Magnolia, Irene Dunne, who believed that Whale was the wrong director for the piece. The 1936 version of Show Boat, faithfully adapted from the original stage production, {{is believed to be the}} definitive film version of the musical by many critics. but became unavailable following the 1951 remake. Warner's has remastered the 1936 version and is presently offering stamped DVDs for a limited time; thereafter, this version will be available on a DVD-on-demand basis using DVD-Rs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about {{three weeks after the}} Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E

25|$|Until the Second Vatican Council the Psalms {{were either}} recited on a one-week or, less {{commonly}} (as {{in the case}} of Ambrosian rite), two-week cycle. Different one-week schemata were employed: most secular clergy followed the Roman distribution, while Monastic Houses almost universally followed that of St Benedict, with only a few congregations (such as the Benedictines of St Maur) following individualistic arrangements. The Breviary introduced in 1974 distributed the psalms over a four-week cycle. Monastic usage varies widely. Some use the four-week cycle of the secular clergy, many retain a one-week cycle, either following St Benedict's scheme <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> their own devising, while others opt for some other arrangement.|$|E
25|$|After {{reaching}} the United States, Zenzo Tagawa was rapidly Americanized to Charlie Tagawa {{and soon after}} he was discovered by numerous restaurant patrons {{as well as other}} banjo players in the area. Tagawa played regularly at Sakura Gardens and its successor restaurant, Imperial Gardens, for fifteen years. On many evenings, one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> Tagawa's banjo or gutbucket-playing friends would drop in to listen or to jam with him. As word traveled of Tagawa's playing skill, he was asked to join the Cupertino Banjo Band. He did so and became their leader in 1966. He has remained so for all but two of the subsequent forty-six years. After taking up residence in Cupertino, Tagawa became a banjo teacher that specialized in teaching young children and teenagers to play the 4-string banjo.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{had many}} involvements in South India, {{including}} {{their support of}} the Paravars in a trade battle {{over control of the}} pearl fisheries of Malabar, but in the Nair kingdoms their principal interest was to obtain control of the trade in pepper. In this they followed the Muslim Arabs, whom they eventually marginalised; and they were in turn followed by the Dutch in 1683. The British and French were also active in the region now known as Kerala, the former from 1615 and the latter from 1725. These various European powers combined with one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> the Nair rulers, fighting for control. One notable alliance was that of the Portuguese with the Kingdom of Cochin, with whom they sided in order to work against the power of the Zamorins of Calicut. Although Calicut remained the most significant of the kingdoms until the 1730s, its power was eroded and the rulers of Cochin were freed from being vassals of the Zamorins.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there is}} no extant music that can be {{positively}} identified with Nero, {{there is a possibility}} that some of it may have been used in later works. John E. Sawyer, in his analysis of Agrippina, reveals that this work, composed five years after Nero with similar characters, [...] "contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero. According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera Rodrigo (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> the lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to Nero. A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1956, Wolters feared {{the effect that}} {{disclosure}} of the GBI's eviction of Jewish tenants might have on Speer.

[...] And this is the point to which the defense should direct itself..." [...] In 1964, Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the Chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release. [...] Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire Chronik, leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. [...] Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes, to leave out extraneous matters, and [...] "above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. [...] The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight." ...|$|E
500|$|The play {{had a good}} initial run, {{although}} Horner's trick and {{the notorious}} china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, The Plain Dealer (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife [...] "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll go see The Country Wife anyway: [...] "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> the same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." [...] Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the [...] "beastly author" [...] of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much {{to put up with}} the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original Country Wife took place in 1931.|$|E
