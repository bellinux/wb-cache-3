5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, {{supporters}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> {{decided on a}} campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.

5|$|Calomiris was {{recruited}} by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA, gaining access to a membership roster. She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant.

She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government, and that the CPUSAacting on instructions from Moscowhad attempted to recruit members working in key war industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1628, an ecclesiastical case {{related to}} a game at East Lavant, near Chichester in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday.

5|$|Separate Virginia {{charges against}} all four {{defendants}} in the dog-fighting case were brought following indictments by the Surry County grand jury when it met on September 25, 2007.

Vick {{was charged with}} two class-6 felonies, which each carried a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|While admitting none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were {{involved}} in the bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all.|$|E
5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were {{sentence}}d to life imprisonment, four to fifteen years in prison, {{two to five years}} and one to two years. After they protested loudly when the sentence was read, they were forcibly removed from the court. Amnesty International concluded that an appeal session on 6 September had heard no evidence to support charges. The military appeal court hearing on 28 September took a few minutes before the court upheld all the convictions. In November, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry asked for a retrial in civilian courts, because they were convicted in military courts.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December {{the poster}} bearing Gardstein's picture {{was seen by}} his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false {{passports}} and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At {{the end of the}} day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{announced}} {{the arrest of}} 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, {{on a variety of}} drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The Allied powers {{organised}} {{war crimes}} trials, {{beginning with the}} Nuremberg trials, held from November 1945 to October 1946, of 23 top Nazi officials. They were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity—in violation of international laws governing warfare. All but three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death. The victorious Allies outlawed the NSDAP and its subsidiary organisations. The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags, swastikas or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria and other restrictions, mainly on public display, apply in various countries. See Swastika § Post–World War II stigmatization for details.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mainstream}} US {{print media}} outlet {{to cover the}} matter was the Chicago Tribune, whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20. Witt had received {{a summary of the}} situation from Alan Bean, a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice. The group sent its document to other reporters and bloggers. In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> occur. Britain's The Observer also featured an article on the case on May 20.|$|E
5|$|The seven-week trial {{included}} {{the testimony of}} 366 witnesses. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were {{sentenced to life in}} prison. Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson affirmed <b>the</b> {{judgment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower court.

This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|R

5|$|In 1993, Croatian {{authorities}} charged Marcel Dusper, Tomo Čačić, Jovo Kuprešanin, Bogdan Odanović, Relja Tomić, Duško Bajić, Dane Drakula, Mićo Vasić, Goce Koneski, Slobodan Dotlić, Dragoljub Lazarević, Radovan Radenković, Bratislav Milojković, Stevo Milošević and Miloš Bogdanović, 15 former JNA officers, {{posted in}} Gospić garrison in 1991 with war crimes against a civilian population. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> except Drakula were tried in absentia. Drakula was acquitted, while Dusper, Tomić and Bajić were {{convicted and sentenced}} to 20 years in prison each while the remaining defendants were sentenced to 15 years. The rulings were upheld by the Supreme Court of Croatia in 1994. Dotlić was arrested on 18 October 2013 after he visited his parents living in Croatia. Prior to his arrest, Dotlić had requested a new trial, but after his arrest the charges against him were changed to armed insurrection but this was later dropped following the General Amnesty Act.|$|E
5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, the defendants called a number of expert witnesses, including medical experts.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} further {{research}} into <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> facial stereotypes on juridic judgments, we investigated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> face/offence congruency on such judgments, {{taking into account}} <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case against <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and <b>the</b> maturity and attractiveness attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> face. Each participant (N = 169) read a fictitious case file that: (1) established <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt with either {{a high degree of}} ambiguity or with a low degree of ambiguity; (2) included a photo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> that was congruent with the offence or not congruent with the offence. Participants were asked to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt (in a dichotomous manner and on a continuous scale), to state their degree of confidence in their decision, to recommend a sentence, and to rate the attractiveness and maturity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> face. <b>The</b> results show that participants' judgments were affected by face/offence congruency and that this influence was not dependent on <b>the</b> ambiguity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case or on the maturity or attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face...|$|R
50|$|Competency {{to stand}} trial is {{generally}} determined via a pretrial evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> overall mental status and mental state at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examination. This evaluation aims to provide sufficient information to allow a judge to rule on <b>the</b> competency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> should a motion to that effect be made by either the prosecutor or defense attorney. A judge may also directly rule a defendant incompetent {{to stand trial}} without receiving a motion to that effect from counsel.|$|R
