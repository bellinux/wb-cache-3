5|$|By 1911, two dams {{had been}} {{constructed}} on Glen Brook (a subtributary of Briar Creek) in Briar Creek Township two {{miles north of}} Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number <b>One,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> capacity of 15 million gallons. The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million gallons. In 1911, a third dam was under construction several hundred feet downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million gallons.|$|E
5|$|Season <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cast of {{four main}} actors. MacFarlane voiced Peter Griffin, a blue-collar worker and {{the patriarch of}} the Griffin family. The family's evil-genius baby Stewie and their anthropromorphic pet dog Brian, were also voiced by MacFarlane. Other {{members of the family}} include Peter's {{responsible}} but rebellious wife Lois Griffin, voiced by Alex Borstein; their self-loathing goody two-shoes teenage daughter Meg, voiced by Lacey Chabert; and their socially-awkward teenage son Chris, voiced by Seth Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private staircase.|$|E

He was released on 21 February 2010, but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against foreign military operations abroad, including leaving Singapore– illegally, if necessary– to do so.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was that no <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting {{with a number of}} the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, {{possibly}} in a belated {{bid for the}} mass market, a stripped down basic version, the Panhard 24 BA was offered.

The Year of The French was one of the many co-productions that RTÉ produced during the 1980s, it was co-produced with the UK's Channel 4 and France's FR2.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission antenna system. <b>One</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E

25|$|Gein {{admitted}} to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain {{as to whether}} the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they exhumed two of the graves and found them empty (<b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crowbar in place of the body), thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (60 cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar, and most of the body was gone from the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.|$|E
25|$|The Arab invasions {{and loss}} of {{territory}} was not all that bore heavily upon the Emperor's mind. It was rumoured that the incestuous marriage to his niece had incurred the wrath of God— of the nine children that he had, four had died in infancy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> twisted neck and one was deaf and dumb. Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} Empire was not even considering the Arab threat as a danger. The religious controversies once again emerged when the Patriarch of Constantinople Sergius proposed monothelitism as a compromise to the Chalcedonian Christians and the Monophysites. Heraclius agreed to the proposal. However, it received much criticism {{from both sides of the}} theological debate of Christ's true nature. When Sophronius, a major critic of monothelitism was elected as Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Empire began once again to tear itself apart. To some in the Empire the Arabs' promise of religious freedom seemed preferable to the other, seemingly blasphemous politically motivated proposals. At his death bed on 11 February 641, Heraclius died whispering that he had lied; he was reluctant to support monothelitism. It appears that unity was all that he sought.|$|E
