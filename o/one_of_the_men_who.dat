5|$|Family {{tradition}} {{holds that}} Johnson broke off an early marital engagement {{when he was}} about sixteen years old because of his mother's disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother's interference. Despite the fact that the engagement was broken off, a daughter named Celia was born. She was raised by the Johnson family and later married to Wesley Fancher, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> served in Johnson's regiment at the Battle of the Thames.|$|E

5|$|When Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, {{was hiding}} from the Nazis in the Kraków Ghetto in 1942, he {{accepted}} a kvitel from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{was assigned to}} protect him. As {{the names of the}} man's children were read aloud, the Rebbe continually stopped the reader when he reached a certain child's name and asked him to begin reading the kvitel again. This happened several times. Later the man learned that this son had died suddenly during the war, but the rest of his family survived.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, {{he founded}} the Bank of New York which {{became one of the}} longest {{operating}} banks in American history, it stayed in business for over 220 years before it merged with another bank in 2007. Hamilton was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Mawson and Mertz's {{illnesses}} remains {{in part a}} mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.|$|E

5|$|The film {{opens with}} Lígia, a barmaid who is {{fed up with}} her grueling routine and who is forced to {{routinely}} turn down the sexual propositions of the bar's customers. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> hits on Lígia is Isaac, a necrophiliac who enjoys sodomizing corpses and drinking their blood. He lives at the Texas Hotel, where Dunga, a gay man, works as a handyman. Dunga is attracted to Wellington, a butcher who delivers meat to the hotel. Wellington, however, is married to Kika, {{a woman who is}} proud to be an evangelical Christian. However, Wellington cheats on his wife with a woman named Dayse. Dayse tires of being Wellington's mistress and tells Dunga about the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each room had one door and one window. When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> did {{not turn}} up to the fateful meeting at Greco's estate was Salvatore Contorno. He sensed trouble and soon went into hiding when the Mafia War broke out. He {{narrowly}} escaped death during an ambush by a Corleonesi hitman, Michele's nephew Pino Greco. While in hiding from both the authorities and the Corleonesi, Contorno sent anonymous letters to the police, revealing to the authorities information on the Mafia, its members, the various factions and the violent turmoil it was undergoing. Contorno was eventually arrested in 1983 and became an informant the following year, following Tommaso Buscetta's example.|$|E
