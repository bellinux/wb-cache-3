40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{experimental study of}} the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> in a loop heat pipe (LHP) which has two parallel evaporators and two parallel condensers. In a single evaporator LHP, {{it is well known}} that the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> is a function of the heat load, the sink temperature and the ambient temperature. The objective of the present study emphasizes on the stability of the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> and parameters that affects the loop operation. Tests results show that the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> is a function of the total system heat load, sink temperature, ambient temperature, and beat load distribution between the two evaporators. Under most conditions, only one compensation chamber (CC) contains two-phase fluid and controls the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the other CC is completely filled with liquid. Moreover, as the test condition changes, control of the loop <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> often shifted from one CC to another. In spite of complex interactions between various components, the test loop has demonstrated very robust operation even during fast transients...|$|R
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures,</b> potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E

40|$|Loop {{heat pipes}} (LHPs) are {{versatile}} two-phase heat transfer devices that have gained increasing acceptance for space and terrestrial applications. The <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> of an LHP {{is a function}} of its operating conditions. The LHP usually reaches a steady <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> for a given heat load and sink <b>temperature.</b> The <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> will change when the heat load and/or the sink temperature changes, but eventually reaches another steady state in most cases.

25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures</b> (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures</b> are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed.
