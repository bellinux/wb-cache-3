Enrollment later increased to 4,756 for the fall semester of 2007, an increase of 14.7% from the year prior. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> enrollment was due to increases in students obtaining college credit in high school, and by partnering with area businesses and industries for workforce training courses.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic {{population}} of Liverpool increased dramatically. About {{half a million}} Irish, who were predominantly Catholic, fled to England to escape the famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the Catholic population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (18141872), saw {{the need for a}} cathedral. The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward's College on St.Domingo Road, Everton.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the Barroso Commission.

As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led {{to the use of}} closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{eighteen}} years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half; three-quarters of this growth came in the 1960s and early 1970s. During {{the second half of}} Brezhnev's reign, average income per head grew by one-quarter. In {{the first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth than what it had been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev's reversal of most of Khrushchev's policies. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.|$|E

5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
