5|$|Sheffield teams {{created the}} first goals with solid crossbars. Heading, throw-ins, corner kicks and {{awarding}} free kicks for fouls were also conceived in Sheffield games. One of the most enduring rules of the Sheffield game prevented a goal from being scored directly from a free kick <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> in/kick in. This was present in every version of the Sheffield Rules and was later adopted within the FA rules. It was later refined by the International Football Association Board into the modern-day indirect free kick.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a young pickpocket named Jiminy desires {{the chance}} to be a good person, but is forced by his father (Harry Groener) and mother (Carolyn Hennesy) to {{participate}} in their cons. After he finishes collecting some stolen goods, Jiminy tells them that he desires to leave the family business. Unfortunately, as years go by, the now-adult Jiminy (Raphael Sbarge) is still aiding his parents, who come up with excuses to keep him from leaving. He runs into a young boy who tells him to follow his conscience. One night, Jiminy pays a visit to see Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and is given a tonic that will set him free from his parents and is told to either have them drink it <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> it over them.|$|E

25|$|Submission-Seeking is a {{reference}} to the strategy of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> and then applying a submission hold, forcing the opponent to submit. While grapplers will often work to attain dominant position, some may be more comfortable fighting from other positions. If a grappler finds themselves unable to force a takedown, they may resort to pulling guard, whereby they physically pull their opponent into a dominant position on the ground.|$|E
25|$|In most {{trumpets}} and cornets, {{the compensation}} {{must be provided}} by extending the third valve slide with {{the third or fourth}} finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see Trigger <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations. On the trumpet and cornet, these valve combinations correspond to low D, low C, low G, and low F, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.|$|E

25|$|A {{character}} can be positioned {{in one of}} three stances: standing, crouching, or prone; each affecting the character's rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage, as there are no armor or health powerups. When the character has taken damage, the edges of the screen glow red and the character's heartbeat increases. If the character stays out of fire, the {{character can}} recover. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player in deciding whether to flee <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> it back at the enemy.|$|E

25|$|Once transformed, Tuxedo Mask {{displays}} additional powers. In the anime shows {{these as}} mainly physical, while the manga depicts them as rare and magical. His iconic mainstay in the anime {{involves the use}} of roses, thrown like darts to injure or distract enemies. He can also twirl them <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> a wide array to block attacks, or can throw many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in most any material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask's roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion's are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight's are white.|$|E

25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart.

An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry <b>or</b> <b>throw</b> it within the goals.
