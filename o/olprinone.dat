40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>olprinone</b> on neuromuscular {{blockade}} caused by vecuronium. Thirty women undergoing nitrous oxide-oxygen-isoflurane anesthesia were randomly divided into <b>olprinone</b> (n= 15) or control group (n= 15). In the <b>olprinone</b> group, the patients received an intravenous initial loading dose of <b>olprinone</b> {{at a rate of}} 2 microg/kg/minute for 5 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of <b>olprinone</b> at 0. 3 microg/kg/minute. In the control group, the patients received normal saline. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusion of <b>olprinone</b> or normal saline, vecuronium (0. 1 mg/kg) was administered. The degree of neuromuscular blockade was monitored electromyographically at the adductor pollicis muscle. The time to the onset of neuromuscular blockade, and to the return of the first, second, third, or fourth response in train-of-four (TOF; T 1, T 2, T 3, or T 4, respectively), and the time course of recovery of T 1 /control did not differ significantly between the groups. After 50 - 70 minutes of vecuronium, the TOF ratio (T 4 /T 1) in the <b>olprinone</b> group was significantly higher than in the control group. During this period, the mean TOF ratios in the control and <b>olprinone</b> groups were 0. 15 - 0. 39 and 0. 40 - 0. 57, respectively. In conclusion, <b>olprinone</b> accelerates the recovery of the TOF ratio, and the quickening effect of <b>olprinone</b> on the recovery of the TOF ratio may be apparent 50 - 70 minutes after vecuronium in anesthetized patients receiving vecuronium...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The authors {{examined}} whether <b>olprinone,</b> a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor, or isoflurane, {{a volatile}} anesthetic, could protect the heart against myocardial infarction in {{type 2 diabetic}} rats and whether the underlying mechanisms involve protein kinase C (PKC), mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (m-K(ATP)) channels, or the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -Akt pathway. METHODS: All rats underwent 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Wistar rats received isoflurane or <b>olprinone</b> before ischemia {{with or without the}} PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (CHE), the m-K(ATP) channel blocker 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid (5 HD), or the PI 3 K-Akt inhibitor LY 294002 (LY). Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were randomly assigned to receive isoflurane or <b>olprinone.</b> In another group, GK rats received LY before the <b>olprinone.</b> RESULTS: In the Wistar rats, both isoflurane (38 +/- 11 %) and <b>olprinone</b> (40 +/- 11 %) reduced infarct size as compared to the control group (59 +/- 8 %). In the GK rats, <b>olprinone</b> (41 +/- 9 %) but not isoflurane (53 +/- 11 %) reduced infarct size as compared to the GK control group (58 +/- 14 %). The beneficial effects of <b>olprinone</b> were blocked by LY (58 +/- 14 %). In the Wistar rats, CHE, 5 HD, and LY prevented isoflurane-induced reductions of infarct size. On the other hand, LY but not CHE or 5 HD prevented olprinone-induced reductions of infarct size. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Olprinone</b> but not isoflurane protects the heart against myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic rats. The olprinone-induced cardioprotective effect is mediated by the PI 3 K-Akt pathway but not PKC or m-K(ATP) channels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: In a {{previous}} study, <b>olprinone</b> {{was found to}} be more effective than milrinone in improving hypercapnic depression of diaphragmatic contractility in dogs. Objective: The purpose of this experimental study was to assess the doserelated effects of <b>olprinone</b> on hypercapnia-induced impairment of diaphragmatic contractility. Methods: This study was conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan. Hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [C 02] in arterial blood 80 - 90 mm Hg) was induced in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs by adding 10 % C 02 to their inspired gas. When hypercapnia was established, the dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: (all dogs were administered a bolus dose of <b>olprinone</b> 10 mg/kg) group 1 was maintained with <b>olprinone</b> 0. 1 μg/kg · min- 1; group 2 was maintained with <b>olprinone</b> 0. 3 μg/kg · min- 1; group 3 was maintained with <b>olprinone</b> 0. 5 μg/kg min- 1; and group 4 received no study drug. The study drug was administered IV for 60 minutes. Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). The study investigator was not blinded to treatment assignment. Results: Twenty-four healthy adult mongrel dogs were used in the study; 6 dogs were assigned to each treatment group. In the presence of hypercapnia in each group, Pdi (mean [SD], cm H 2 O) at low-frequency (20 -Hz) and high-frequency (100 -Hz) stimulation significantly decreased from baseline (all, P = 0. 001). During study drug administration in groups 1, 2, and 3, Pdi at both stimuli levels increased significantly from hypercapnia-induced values (all, P = 0. 001); in group 4, Pdi to each stimulus did not change significantly from hypercapnia-induced values. There was a significant correlation between <b>olprinone</b> dose and Pdi at both stimuli (all, P = 0. 001). The regression equations were: Pdi at 20 -Hz stimulation (cm H 2 O) = 24. 97 × <b>olprinone</b> dose (μg/kg · min- 1) + 13. 54 (r = 0. 887; n = 24) and Pdi at 100 -Hz stimulation (cm H 2 O) = 29. 18 × <b>olprinone</b> dose (μg/kg · min- 1) + 20. 55 (r = 0. 911; n = 24). Conclusion: <b>Olprinone</b> was associated with a dose-dependent improvement of hypercapnia-induced impairment of diaphragmatic contractility in these pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Little {{research}} {{has been reported to}} date on the usefulness of <b>olprinone</b> in pediatric cardiac surgery, and no standard pediatric infusion protocol is currently established. Our study sought to confirm that the regimen described herein rapidly achieves the requisite plasma <b>olprinone</b> concentrations. Methods: For the purposes of our study, we enrolled 13 patients: 7 biventricular repair candidates and 6 Fontan-type operation candidates. We administered a continuous infusion of <b>olprinone</b> to our study subjects at 0. 3 μg/kg/min with no loading dose starting approximately 30 minutes (min) before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We performed blood sampling at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the start of infusion and at the same elapsed intervals after separation from CPB. We measured plasma <b>olprinone</b> concentrations using ultra-fast liquid chromatography. Results: We observed effective plasma olpri- none concentrations (> 20 ng/ml) at 30 min after weaning from CPB, or at 60 min after the start of infusion.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesOur study {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>olprinone</b> on hemodynamics and oxygen delivery on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and to compare the effects of <b>olprinone</b> and milrinone. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 50 pediatric patients administered either <b>olprinone</b> or milrinone on weaning from CPB during cardiac surgery. At 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes (min) after separation from CPB, we collected data on hemodynamics and oxygen delivery. At the same time points, we also recorded the doses of cardiovascular-acting drugs used concomitantly. We analyzed differences among measurement points by one-way ANOVA and differences between two agents groups by two-way ANOVA. ResultsOlprinone increased systolic blood pressure (sBP) at 120 min in biventricular repair (BV) and from 90 min in Fontan-type operation (FO). <b>Olprinone</b> produced significant stepwise tapering of dopamine from 60 min and dobutamine from 90 min in BV. For BV, <b>olprinone</b> significantly increased central venous oxygen saturation from 30 min; oxygen excess factor at 30 and 120 min; and cerebral tissue oxygen index from 30 min, except at 60 min. Except for {{a significant increase in}} sBP and significant tapering of DOA dose at 120 min in BV, milrinone had no effect on any parameters in either type of operation. Comparisons of the two agent groups showed no significant difference in any parameters. ConclusionOlprinone stabilizes circulation and improves oxygen delivery during BV pediatric cardiac surgery.

30|$|We used a {{modification}} of the VIS described by Gaies et al. (2010). We expanded this formula to include the inotrope <b>olprinone,</b> which is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor widely used in Japan; we chose 25 as its coefficient because the ratio of maintenance infusion of milrinone (0.25  µg/kg/min) was {{compared with that of}} <b>olprinone</b> (0.1  µg/kg/min) in a previous report (Orime et al. 1999). Additionally, Milrila®K (Astellas, Tokyo, Japan) specifies a maintenance dose range of 0.25 – 0.75  µg/kg/min, whereas Coretec® (Eisai, Japan) lists the range as 0.1 – 0.3  µg/kg/min; therefore, we concluded that a coefficient for <b>olprinone</b> 2.5 times that of milrinone was appropriate.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Olprinone</b> {{hydrochloride}} is a {{newly developed}} compound that selectively inhibits PDE type III and {{is characterized by}} several properties, including positive inotropic effects, peripheral vasodilatory effects, and a bronchodilator effect. In clinical settings, <b>olprinone</b> is commonly used to treat congestive cardiac failure, due to its inotropic and vasodilating effects. The mechanism of these cardiac effects is attributed to increased cellular concentrations of cAMP. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the pharmacological action of <b>olprinone</b> on the secondary damage in experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Traumatic SCI is characterized by an immediate, irreversible loss of tissue at the lesion site, as well as a secondary expansion of tissue damage over time. Although secondary injury should be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with SCI. Spinal cord trauma was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T 5 -T 8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, and production of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, apoptosis, and locomotor disturbance. <b>Olprinone</b> treatment (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly reduced: (1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), (3) nitrotyrosine formation, (4) pro-inflammatory cytokines, (5) NF-kappaB expression, (6) p-ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 expression and (7) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, FAS ligand, Bax and Bcl- 2 expression). Moreover, <b>olprinone</b> significantly ameliorated the recovery of hind-limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that <b>olprinone</b> treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} vasodilatation induced by <b>olprinone,</b> a phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor, were investigated in smooth muscle of the rabbit coronary artery. Isometric force and membrane potential were measured simultaneously using endothelium-denuded smooth muscle strips. Acetylcholine (ACh, 3 [*]μM) produced a contraction with a membrane depolarization (15. 2 ± 1. 1 [*]mV). In a solution containing 5. 9 [*]mM K+, <b>olprinone</b> (100 [*]μM) hyperpolarized the resting membrane and (i) caused the absolute membrane potential level reached with ACh {{to be more}} negative (but did not reduce the delta membrane potential seen with ACh, 15. 2 ± 1. 8 mV) and (ii) attenuated the ACh-induced contraction. In a solution containing 30 [*]mM K+, these effects were not seen with <b>olprinone.</b> Glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) blocked the olprinone-induced membrane hyperpolarization. 4 -AP (0. 1 [*]mM) significantly attenuated the olprinone-induced resting membrane hyperpolarization but TEA (1 [*]mM) had no such effect. Glibenclamide (10 [*]μM), TEA (1 [*]mM) and 4 -AP (0. 1 [*]mM), given separately, all failed to modify the inhibitory actions of <b>olprinone</b> on (i) the absolute membrane potential level seen with ACh and (ii) the ACh-induced contraction. It is suggested that <b>olprinone</b> inhibits the ACh-induced contraction through {{an effect on the}} absolute level of membrane potential achieved with ACh in smooth muscle of the rabbit coronary artery. It is also suggested that glibenclamide-sensitive, ATP-sensitive K+ channels do not {{play an important role in}} the olprinone-induced inhibition of the ACh-induced contraction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground:Diaphragmatic fatigue might {{contribute}} to the development of respiratory failure. In particular, the spontaneous, natural rate of phrenic nerve discharge occurs mainly in low-frequency ranges making low-frequency fatigue clinically important in both humans and animals. <b>Olprinone,</b> a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, improves contractility in fatigued diaphragm, but is also associated with hypotension. Dopamine might be used concomitantly for treating related hypotension. Objective:The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of olprinoneplus dopamine on diaphragmatic fatigue in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Methods:This nonblinded study was conducted at the Department ofAnesthesiology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Tsukuba, Japan. Diaphragmatic fatigue (assessed by a decrease in diaphragmatic contractility) was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 minutes. Immediately after the fatigue-producing period, groups 2, 3, and 4 received an initial 10 μg/kg dose of <b>olprinone.</b> Group 2 then received maintenance <b>olprinone</b> of 0. 3 μg/kg · min; group 3 received maintenance <b>olprinone</b> 0. 3 μg/kg · min plus dopamine 2 μg/kg · min; and group 4 received maintenance <b>olprinone</b> 0. 3 μg/kg · min plus dopamine 5 μg/kg · min. Group 1 received no study drug. <b>Olprinone</b> and dopamine were administered IV for 30 minutes. Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by measuring the maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated by test stimuli after airway occlusion at functional residual capacity. Hypotension induced by the study drugs was defined as a > 10 mm Hg decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), calculated by diastolic pressure plus ⅓ pulse pressure, from baseline. Results:Twenty-eight mongrel dogs (18 males and 10 females, weighing 10 - 15 kg) were used in the study; 7 dogs were randomly assigned to each treatment group. When fatigue was established in each group, mean (SD) Pdi at low-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation decreased significantly from baseline in all groups (group 1 : 15. 6 [2. 2] vs 11. 7 [2. 4] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 008; group 2 : 15. 4 [1. 5] vs 11. 6 [1. 3] cm H 2 O, P= 0. 005; group 3 : 15. 5 [2. 0] vs 11. 6 [1. 8] cm H 2 O, P= 0. 006; group 4 : 15. 7 [1. 4] vs 12. 0 [1. 4] cm H 2 O, P= 0. 008), while no significant change existed in Pdi at high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation (P = NS). After study drug administration, Pdi in groups 2, 3, and 4 increased significantly from fatigued values at both 20 Hz stimulation (group 2 : 11. 6 [1. 3] vs 21. 8 [2. 0] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 001; group 3 : 11. 6 [1. 8] vs 22. 2 [1. 8] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 001; group 4 : 12. 0 [1. 4] vs 25. 9 [1. 9] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 001) and 100 Hz stimulation (group 2 : 22. 0 [2. 2] vs 29. 0 [1. 9] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 002; group 3 : 22. 1 [2. 0] vs 29. 3 [2. 2] cm H 2 O, P = 0. 002; group 4 : 21. 8 [2. 2] vs 31. 7 [2. 4] cm H 2 O, P= 0. 001). The increase in Pdi was significantly larger in group 4 compared with the other 3 groups (all, P < 0. 05). Hypotension was not observed in group 4. MAP did not change significantly in group 1 or group 4 compared with baseline or fatigued MAP values (P = NS). Groups 2 and 3 had significant decreases in MAP with treatment compared with values in group 1 and with baseline and fatigued MAP values (all, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Background—Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDEIII-Is) {{improve the}} hemodynamic status {{of heart failure}} via inotropic/vasodilatory effects {{attributable}} {{to the increase in}} intracellular cAMP level. Direct cardioprotection by PDEIII-Is and its underlying mechanisms, however, have not been identified. We tested the infarct size–limiting effect of PDEIII-Is and the roles of cAMP, protein kinase (PK) A, PKC, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families in open-chest dogs. Methods and Results—Milrinone, <b>olprinone</b> (PDEIII-Is), or dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) was injected intravenously 30 minutes before 90 -minute ischemia, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. <b>Olprinone</b> was also examined with an intracoronary cotreatment with a PKA inhibitor (H 89), a PKC inhibitor (GF 109203 X), an extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD 98059), or a p 38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) throughout the preischemic period. Either PDEIII-Is or db-cAMP caused substantial hemodynamic changes, which returned to control levels in 30 minutes. Collateral flow and percent risk area were identical for all groups. Both PDEIII-Is and db-cAMP increased myocardial p 38 MAPK activity during the preischemic period, which was blocked by H 89, but not by GF 109203 X.

Methods:This experimental study was conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Tsukuba, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Tsukuba, Japan. Hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [CO 2] in arterial blood 80 – 90 mm Hg) was induced by adding 10 % CO 2 to the inspired gas. When hypercapnia was established, group 1 received no study drug, group 2 was infused with milrinone (50 g/kg initial dose plus 0. 5 g/kg · min− 1 thereafter), and group 3 was infused with <b>olprinone</b> (10 g/kg initial dose plus 0. 3 g/kg · min− 1 thereafter). Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). Results:Twenty-four, healthy, adult mongrel dogs were used in the study; 8 dogs were assigned to each treatment group. In the presence of hypercapnia, in each group, Pdi (mean [SD], cm-H 2 O) at low-frequency (20 Hz) and highfrequency (100 Hz) stimulation significantly decreased from baseline (group 1 : 20 Hz, 15. 1 [2. 4] vs 13. 3 [2. 7]; 100 Hz, 23. 1 [2. 7] vs 20. 6 [2. 5], both, P = 0. 001; group 2 : 20 Hz, 15. 2 [2. 0] vs 13. 2 [2. 5]; 100 Hz, 23. 0 [2. 5] vs 20. 5 [2. 5], both, P = 0. 001; group 3 : 20 Hz, 15. 0 [2. 2] vs 13. 2 [2. 1]; 100 Hz, 23. 0 [2. 5] vs 20. 5 [2. 7], both, P = 0. 001). In group 1, the change in Pdi with regard to each stimulus was not significant when compared with the hypercapnia-induced values. In groups 2 and 3, during study-drug administration, Pdi increased significantly in response to both stimuli compared with hypercapnia-induced values (group 2 : 20 Hz, 13. 2 [2. 5] vs 18. 8 [2. 2]; 100 Hz, 20. 5 [2. 5] vs 27. 7 [2. 3], both, P = 0. 001; group 3 : 20 Hz, 13. 2 [2. 1] vs 22. 3 [3. 5]; 100 Hz, 20. 5 [2. 7] vs 30. 8 [2. 2], both, P = 0. 001). The increase in Pdi with both stimuli was significantly greater in group 3 than in group 2 (20 Hz, 22. 3 [3. 5] vs 18. 8 [2. 2], P = 0. 035; 100 Hz, 30. 8 [2. 2] vs 27. 7 [2. 3], P = 0. 046).

40|$|Background]: The {{ambulatory}} {{treatment of}} advanced heart failure (HF) with intermittent infusions of inotropes or natriuretic peptide chosen immediately before each infusion {{has not been}} described. [Methods]: Between May 2005 and July 2009, we treated 11 patients presenting with advanced HF, who received a total of 369 infusions of carperitide, <b>olprinone,</b> dopamine, or dobutamine, once or twice weekly. The pharmaceutical was selected before each infusion based on the systolic blood pressure (BP). [Results]: Carperitide, <b>olprinone,</b> and catecholamines were administered to 8 (73 infusions of 0. 030 ± 0. 004 μg/kg/min for 3. 3 ± 0. 8 h), 4 (18 infusions of 0. 070 ± 0. 017 μg/kg/min for 3. 3 ± 0. 5 h), and 6 patients (278 infusions of 3. 6 ± 1. 9 μg/kg/min for 2. 8 ± 1. 0 h), respectively. No adverse effect requiring cessation of infusion was observed. Over a mean follow-up of 29. 3 ± 28. 8 months (range 2 – 104), 4 patients died, all from cardiac causes. The Kaplan–Meier cumulative survival rate was 69. 3 % at 20 months (median follow-up). Compared with the pre-infusion period, the duration and number of hospitalizations for management of HF were decreased by 73. 9 % (p = 0. 017), and 51. 9 % (p = 0. 007), respectively, during the treatment period, and the overall medical costs by 56. 9 % (p = 0. 021). [Conclusions]: In this study population, intermittent drug infusions selected from inotropes or natriuretic peptide based on the baseline systolic BP significantly decreased the length and number of hospitalizations and costs, without increasing mortality.

With the high availability of commercial reagents and great efficiency in expanding molecule diversity, this methodology is superior to the existing procedures for {{the synthesis of}} 2, 3 -diarylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines analogues. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines are extremely popular amongchemists and medicinal chemists due to their remarkable biological and pharmacological activities 1 such as anticancer, 2 anti-inflammatory, 3 antibacterial, 4 antiprotozonal, 5 antiviral, 6 antiulcer, 7 and antifungal. 8 Within the imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine family, several products have progressed to market, including alpidem (anxiolytic), 9 necopidem (anxiolytic), 10 saripidem (anxiolytic), 11 zolpidem (insomnia), 12 <b>olprinone</b> (cardioton-ic), 13 minodronic acid (bisphosphonate), 14 divalpon (anxio-lytic), 15 and zolimidine (antiulcer). 16 The imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine derivatives, 2, 3 -diarylimidazo-[1, 2 -a]pyridines also exhibit {{a wide range of}} biologica...|$|E
30|$|There {{were some}} {{limitations}} to this study. First, {{the number of}} patients was relatively small. We conducted a power analysis to determine the minimum number required for each group. Because no previous studies comparable to ours have been conducted, we empirically designated the difference in the VIS means as eight. The variance of VIS was computed based on the VIS variance of the first 20 patients. Although we conducted a power analysis, {{it is possible that the}} ideal sample size is larger than presented here because of the empirical process. Second, this study was retrospective and the accuracy of chart documentation cannot be guaranteed. Besides, we cannot eliminate the other multiple factors affecting vasodilatory responses other than ECMO, including multi-organ failure, use of IABP, mechanical ventilation, possibly intraoperative blood loss or dosage of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Third, the coefficient of <b>olprinone</b> in modified VIS may be inaccurate because it was defined based on the study with small number of patients. Finally, this was a single-center study, and thus our findings may not be generalizable to other patient populations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 47 -year-old Japanese {{woman was}} transported to our {{hospital}} due to acute heart failure (AHF). She {{had been diagnosed}} with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and undergone parathyroidectomy 3 months previously. Chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly and severe pulmonary congestion, and transthoracic echocardiography indicated both left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction, complicated with extensive massive myocardial calcification and no LV hypertrophy. Computed tomography also showed massive myocardial calcification in the posterior wall of the LV and the interventricular septum. After treatment with furosemide, <b>olprinone,</b> and carperitide under Swan-Ganz monitoring, LV ejection fraction was almost normalized. However, cardiac catheterization in the chronic phase indicated that LV diastolic dysfunction still existed, which might be affected by myocardial calcification. We followed this patient using spironolactone (25 mg/day), perindopril (8 mg/day), and bisoprolol (1. 25 mg/day), with no further episode of heart failure for at least 6 months. Here, we report a rare case of AHF complicated with massive myocardial calcification possibly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. <Learning objective: This is the first case report of acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, complicated with massive myocardial calcification, “porcelain heart”, possibly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. ...|$|E
40|$|Drugs such as necopidem, saripidem, alpidem, zolpidem, and <b>olprinone</b> contain nitrogencontaining bicyclic, condensed-imidazo 1, 2 -Î±pyridines as {{bioactive}} scaffolds. In this work, {{we report}} a high-yield one pot synthesis of 1 -(2 -methyl- 8 -aryl-substitued-imidazo 1, 2 -Î± pyridin- 3 -yl) ethan- 1 -onefor the first-time. Subsequently, we performed in silico mode-ofaction analysis and {{predicted that the}} synthesized imidazopyridines targets Phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). In vitro analysis confirmed the predicted target PLA 2 for the novel imidazopyridine derivative 1 -(2 -Methyl- 8 -naphthalen- 1 -yl-imidazo 1, 2 -Î±pyridine- 3 -yl) -ethanone (compound 3 f) showing significant inhibitory activity towards snake venom PLA 2 with an IC 50 value of 14. 3 Î¼M. Evidently, the molecular docking analysis suggested that imidazopyridine compound was able to bind to the active site of the PLA 2 with strong affinity, whose affinity values are comparable to nimesulide. Furthermore, we estimated the potential for oral bioavailability by Lipinski's Rule of Five. Hence, it is concluded that the compound 3 f could be a lead molecule against snake venom PLA 2.

40|$|Background]Donor {{safety is}} a major concern in living-donor liver transplantation. However, partial grafts do not meet the {{functional}} demands of recipients and lead to small-for-size syndrome (SFSS). In a previous study, we showed that <b>olprinone</b> (OLP), a selective phosphodiesterase ІІІ inhibitor, up-regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase level in the liver and attenuates shear stress, sinusoidal endothelial cell injury, and hepatocyte apoptosis after excessive liver resection in a rat model. We aimed to examine whether OLP treatment has beneficial effects on SFSS in a rat model of partial liver transplantation (PLT). [Methods]We performed experiments in a rat model of 30 % PLT. In the OLP group, we inserted an osmotic pump with OLP into the peritoneal cavity 48 h before liver graft sampling. Recipient rats were not treated with OLP. We examined the liver microstructure by electron microscopy and biochemical examination, and determined the 7 -d survival of recipients. [Results]In the OLP group 1 h after PLT, the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver were well preserved and we observed few vacuolar structures in hepatocytes. The total serum bilirubin level 1 wk after PLT tended to be lower in the OLP group than in the controls, and the liver microstructures were also well preserved in the OLP group. The probability of survival in the OLP group (100 %; 14 of 14 rats) was significantly higher than that in the control group (75 %; 15 of 20 rats). [Conclusions]Olprinone treatment was demonstrated to have therapeutic potential to overcome SFSS...|$|E
40|$|Some {{anti-inflammatory}} medications reduce {{alcohol consumption}} in rodent models. Inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) increases cAMP and reduces inflammatory signaling. Rolipram, an inhibitor of PDE 4, markedly reduced ethanol intake and preference in mice and reduced ethanol seeking and consumption in alcohol-preferring fawn-hooded rats (Hu et al., 2011;Wen et al., 2012). To determine if these effects were specific for PDE 4, we compared nine PDE inhibitors with different subtype selectivity: propentofylline (nonspecific), vinpocetine (PDE 1), <b>olprinone,</b> milrinone (PDE 3), zaprinast (PDE 5), rolipram, mesopram, piclamilast, and CDP 840 (PDE 4). Alcohol intake {{was measured in}} C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice using 24 -hour two-bottle choice and two-bottle choice with limited (three-hour) access to alcohol. Only the selective PDE 4 inhibitors reduced ethanol intake and preference in the 24 -hour two-bottle choice test. For rolipram, piclamilast, and CDP 840, this effect was observed after the first 6 hours but not after the next 18 hours. Mesopram, however, produced a long-lasting reduction of ethanol intake and preference. In the limited access test, rolipram, piclamilast, and mesopram reduced ethanol consumption and total fluid intake and did not change preference for ethanol, whereas CDP 840 reduced both consumption and preference without altering total fluid intake. Our results provide novel evidence for a selective role of PDE 4 in regulating ethanol drinking in mice. We suggest that inhibition of PDE 4 may be an unexplored target for medication development to reduce excessive alcohol consumption...|$|E
40|$|Excessive portal flow {{to a small}} remnant liver or small-for-size graft is {{a primary}} factor of small-for-size syndrome. We {{demonstrated}} that <b>olprinone</b> (OLP), a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, had a hepatoprotective effect in a rat extended hepatectomy model and a small-for-size liver transplantation model through a modification of the portal venous pressure (PVP). To identify the appropriate dose and duration of treatment for clinical applications, we conducted experiments with a swine partial hepatectomy model. Twenty microminipigs were divided into 4 groups that received the following treatments: (A) saline (control group), (B) OLP at 0. 3 μg/kg/minute (preoperative and postoperative administration), (C) OLP at 0. 1 μg/kg/minute (preoperative administration), and (D) OLP at 0. 3 μg/kg/minute (preoperative administration). The pigs underwent 70 % partial hepatectomy. Hemodynamic changes, including changes in PVP, were examined. Liver biopsy was performed 1 and 3 hours after hepatectomy. Blood samples were collected until postoperative day 7 (POD 7). In comparison with group A, PVP elevations, periportal edema, and sinusoidal hemorrhaging were attenuated after left Glisson's ligation in groups C and D. Pretreatment with OLP in groups C and D preserved the microstructure of sinusoids and improved the prothrombin activity 1 and 3 hours after hepatectomy. These animals showed better recovery of the remnant liver volume and the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green on POD 7. In contrast, group B showed exacerbation of liver damage. Measurements of the serum OLP concentration showed that 10 ng/mL OLP was appropriate for a hepatoprotective effect. In conclusion, pretreatment with OLP shows hepatoprotective effects in a swine partial hepatectomy model. OLP may {{have the potential to}} ameliorate patients' outcomes after hepatectomy or liver transplantation...|$|E

Uemoto. 2009. A phosphodiesterase III inhibitor protects rat liver from sinusoidal obstruction syndrome through heme oxygenase- 1 induction. Annals of Surgery 249, (5) : 806 - 813. "OBJECTIVE:: The aim of study was to investigate pharmacological treatment for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). BACKGROUND:: SOS is associated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases. Patients with SOS have increased postoperative morbidity after major hepatectomy, but a method for effective prevention of SOS has not been established. METHODS:: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) or <b>olprinone</b> (OLP), a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, and hepatic HO- 1 expression and HO enzymatic activity were determined. Monocrotaline (MCT) was given to rats to induce SOS, and blockage of SOS by CoPP or OLP-induced hepatic HO- 1 was examined in these rats. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), a competitive HO inhibitor, was given to MCT-treated rats together with OLP to clarify the mechanism of protection against SOS. We also examined if OLP preserved remnant liver function after 70 % hepatectomy in MCT-treated rats. RESULTS:: OLP up-regulated hepatic HO- 1 protein expression and HO enzymatic activity, and activated Akt protein. Administration of ZnPP to OLP-treated rats resulted in inhibition of HO activity and inactivation of Akt. Induction of HO- 1 by pretreatment with CoPP led to amelioration of SOS in histologic findings and blockage of elevation of serum liver enzymes. Pretreatment with OLP gave a similar result and preserved remnant liver function, as indicated by improved survival after hepatectomy. ZnPP completely abolished the protective effects of OLP. CONCLUSIONS:: Protection of the liver from drug-induced injury by prior up-regulation of HO- 1 using OLP may have potential as a therapeutic strategy for prevention of SOS...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{protocols}} involving easy handling process, atom economy, ambient reaction conditions, short reaction times, {{inexpensive and}} less hazardous catalyst {{always have been}} attractive. Multi-component reaction is a chemical reaction, in which three or more starting materials react to form the product in an atom economy manner and ease of access to complex molecules in one-pot certainly belong to this class. A contemporary challenge {{in the world is}} environmental pollution. Multi component reactions are certainly one of the solutions for this problem due to the less release of chemical wastage compared with classical bicomponent reaction protocols and it is being considered as one of the green technology. I have also tried to use water as a reaction solvent to synthesize heterocyclic compounds because water is cheaper, green solvent and highly abundant in nature. I have synthesized various valuable heterocyclic compounds using multicomponent reactions. Compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone have been used to control the cell proliferation in breast cancer and p 38 kinase inhibitors. Wang Le et. al., also have reported molecules having pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone as BRD 4 receptor inhibitors to control breast cancer. Considering the importance of these molecules, we have demonstrated an efficient, mild and multicomponent protocol for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone by using Ugi four component reaction and post condensation of Ugi adduct. This method offers several advantages such as easy handling procedure, atom economy, short reaction time and huge molecular library can be synthesized by changing the substituents on four independent starting materials. In previous reported methods for pyrrolo[2, 3 - c]pyridones, expensive metal catalysts were used, where as in present method we used inexpensive PTSA catalyst. Various anilines substituted with Iodo, bromo, chloro, methyl, methoxy at different positions on aniline were used in Ugi 4 CR. And also phenyl glyoxylic acids substituted with methoxy, ethoxy, methyl and chloro were used in combinations with t-butyl and cyclohexyl isocyanides. In all cases the reaction proceeded smoothly and yielded the corresponding pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone derivatives in good to excellent yields. Considering these advantages we hope this methodology will be useful for medicinal chemists in drug discovery process. All the products were characterized by using NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and FAB mass. One of the products was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. Coumarin analogs having both coumarin and furan heterocycles have gained the considerable attention of researchers due to their significant properties as anti-leishmania panamensis, dyes and fluorescent sensors. Coumarin analogs with furan heterocycle isolated from the plants origin such as microminutin, micromelin, psoralen, 8 -methoxypsoralen have important properties in medicinal chemistry and bio photochemistry. It is well documented that by introducing a heteroaromatic substituent at 3 -position the absorption and emission maxima of coumarin scaffold can be improved because of extended πconjugation and consequently their optoelectronic properties can be improved. Based on this phenomenon a variety of 3 -heteroaryl coumarin derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their optoelectronic properties. Considering the broad range of applications of furyl coumarin derivatives, we have demonistrated an efficient and facile synthesis of 3 -furyl coumarin derivatives by reaction of 4 - chloro- 3 -formylcoumarin, secondary amines, dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and diversely substituted isocyanides using four component one pot reaction. All the products were isolated as yellow color fluorescent solids by column chromatography in quantitative yield and characterized with 1 H NMR, C 13 NMR, IR and FAB mass. Spiro compounds having dipyrrole namely Amathaspiramide A, Mytraginine psuedoindoxyl as shown below was proven to have prominent antiviral and anticancer properties. Very few reports were there in the literature for the synthesis of spiro [indole- 2, 2 ’- pyrroles] bearing spiro carbon at C- 2 position. Considering this as an opportunity, we have developed an efficient and facile method for the synthesis of novel spiro[indole- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -pyrroles] from N-methyl- 3 -isatin imines, t-butyl isocyanide and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate has been achieved by [3 + 2] cyclo addition reaction. The notable advantages of this protocol are operational simplicity, easily available starting materials, available diversity of each component, catalyst free and easy work procedure employed. We believed in this protocol will help in developing novel spiro heterocyclic compounds using C- 2 carbon atom of isatin. All the products were purified by column chromatography as yellow solids and confirmed with 1 H NMR, 13 CNMR, FAB mass, IR. One of the compound was further confirmed with X-ray analysis. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines have been valuable to organic and medicinal chemists due to the interesting structure and numerous applications in pharmaceutical Industry. The molecules possessing imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine core structure have been used as anticancer, antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antiprotozonal and antiviral agents. Additionally, they were also used for the treatment of gastric disease and heart disease. They have been found in drug candidates such as Minodronic acid used for the treatment of osteoporosis, Zolpidem used for the treatment of insomnia and some brain disorders, Zolmidine used for the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastro esophageal reflux disease and <b>Olprinone</b> used for the treatment of acute heart failure. Considering these applications, New coumarin derivatives having imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine heterocycle moiety were synthesized by the condensation of 4 -morpholino- 3 -formyl coumarin, diversely substituted 2 -amino pyridine and isocyanides under catalyst free, water mediated reaction conditions. All the products were characterized by using IR, NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and HRMS spectrometry. Product 4 b was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. All the products have showed UV-Visible absorbance in between 234 nm to 248 nm and emissions were observed in between 412 nm to 544 nm. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 436 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.
