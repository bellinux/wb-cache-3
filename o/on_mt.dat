5|$|VK3RTV is an {{experimental}} Amateur Television repeater located <b>on</b> <b>Mt</b> Dandenong {{to the east}} of Melbourne. In late September 2009 the former single analog channel was converted to a 2 channel digital system. The output of the transmitter is on 446.5MHz which can be received on some set top boxes and digital televisions. Both channels are transmitted in standard definition.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries <b>on</b> <b>Mt.</b> Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
5|$|At the split, MD 4 heads {{northwest}} on four-lane divided Southern Maryland Boulevard while MD 2 heads northeast on two-lane undivided Solomons Island Road. Shortly after splitting from MD 4, {{the route}} intersects the eastern terminus of MD 262 (Lower Marlboro Road) before heading into woodland with areas of residences and businesses. Another section of MD 765 called Wayside Drive loops {{to the west}} of MD 2 for a distance before MD 765 loops again to the east <b>on</b> <b>Mt.</b> Harmony Lane. MD 765 returns to MD 2 past this intersection and MD 778 then loops to the east of the route on Old Solomons Island Road. The route continues north to an intersection with MD 260 (Chesapeake Beach Road) near Owings.|$|E
40|$|Metallothioneins (MTs) are metal-chelating {{proteins}} {{occurring in}} animals, plants and prokaryotes, involved in detosification and immunity. They {{do not constitute}} a monophyletic protein family, but rather a superfamily of heterogeneous, low molecular weight, cysteine-rich peptides. Current knowledge <b>on</b> <b>MTs</b> comes mainly from vertebrate molecules which are composed of approximately 60 amino acids, including 20 cysteine residues, and folded into two independent domains when coordinating divalent metal ions. Up to now, there are no descriptions of MTs in invertebrate Chordates althought {{it seems that the}} vertebrate structure is maintained also in other deuterostomes such as the echinoderms. In this study, we present some data <b>on</b> <b>MTs</b> of the solitary urochordate Ciona intestinalis. We have cloned the transcript and characterized the gene of a new MT, codifying for 39 amino acids, including 12 cys residues (30...|$|R
40|$|Hyperphosphorylated {{forms of}} the {{neuronal}} microtubule (MT) -associated protein tau are major components of Alzheimer’s disease paired helical filaments. Previously, we reported that AB�C, the dominant brain isoform of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), is localized <b>on</b> <b>MTs,</b> binds directly to tau, and is a major tau phosphatase in cells. We now describe direct interactions among tau, PP 2 A, and MTs at the submolecular level. Using tau deletion mutants, we found that AB�C binds a domain on tau that is indistinguishable from its MT-binding domain. AB�C binds directly to MTs through a site that encompasses its catalytic subunit and is distinct from its binding site for tau, and AB�C and tau bind to different domains <b>on</b> <b>MTs.</b> Specific PP 2 A isoforms bind to MTs with distinct affinities in vitro, and these interaction...|$|R
