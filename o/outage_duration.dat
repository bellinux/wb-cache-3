From this data we observed that DGD varies slowly over time but rapidly over wavelength. This data showed good agreement with a Maxwellian distribution. The frequency-averaged mean DGD varied by about 10 % or less during the periods that included significant temperature swings. Outage analysis showed that for system tolerances of three times the mean DGD, outages will occur typically every 3 to 8 years with mean <b>outage</b> <b>durations</b> ranging from about one to two hours. From this analysis we conclude that high-DGD episodes are spectrally localized and will be exceedingly rare and short lived...|$|R

40|$|Reliability worth {{assessment}} {{is an important}} factor in power system planning and operation. An equally important issue is how to use customer costs of electric supply interruptions as surrogates to appropriately quantify reliability worth. Postal or in-person surveys of electric customers are often used to determine interruption costs. The results obtained from the surveys are transformed into customer damage functions which are applicable to individual customer classes and sectors. Standard customer damage functions use aggregate or average customer costs for selected <b>outage</b> <b>durations.</b> This paper develops a practical alternative to the customer damage function method of describing the interruption cost data. The alternate technique, which is designated as the probability distribution approach, is capable of recognizing the dispersed nature of the data.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the thermal hydraulic analysis performed {{to provide a}} technical basis in support of consolidation of tank C- 106 waste into tank AY- 102. Several parametric calculations were performed using the HUB and GOTH computer codes. First, the current heat load of tank AY- 102 was determined. Potential quantities of waste transfer from tank C- 106 were established to maintain the peak temperatures of consolidated sludge in tank AY- 102 to remain within Operating Specification limits. For this purpose, it was shown that active cooling of the tank floor was essential and a secondary ventilation flow of 2, 000 cfm should be maintained. Transient calculations were also conducted to evaluate the effects of ambient meteorological cyclic conditions on sludge peak temperature, and loss of ventilation systems. Detailed calculations were also performed to estimate the insulating concrete air channels cooling effectiveness and the resulting peak temperatures for the consolidated sludge in tank AY- 102.

Our key technique is for clients to invoke an association change based on (i) joint use of channel quality measurements and AP quality scores that reflect long-term differences in AP performance and (ii) controlled measurement and hand-off time scales to balance the need for the instantaneously best association against performance penalties incurred from spurious handoffs due to channel fluctuations and marginally improved i associations.

40|$|Abstract—The outage {{probability}} {{is an important}} performance measure for cooperative diversity schemes. However, in mobile en-vironments, the {{outage probability}} does not completely describe the behavior of cooperative diversity schemes since the mobility of the involved nodes introduces variations in the channel gains. As a result, the capacity outage events are correlated in time and second-order statistical parameters of the achievable information-theoretic capacity such as the average capacity outage rate (AOR) and the average capacity <b>outage</b> <b>duration</b> (AOD) are required to obtain amore complete description of the properties of cooperative diversity protocols. In this paper, assuming slow Rayleigh fading, we derive exact expressions for the AOR and the AOD of three well-known cooperative diversity protocols: variable-gain amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and selection decode-and-for-ward relaying. Furthermore, we develop asymptotically tight high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations, which offer important insights into the influence of various system and channel param-eters on the AOR and the AOD. In particular, we show that on a double-logarithmic scale, similar to the outage probability, the AORasymptotically decays with the SNRwith a slope {{that depends on the}} diversity gain of the cooperative protocol, whereas the AOD asymptotically decays with a slope of independent of the di-versity gain.

40|$|In is {{expected}} that electrical energy storage facilities will be installed for improving load factor. Although there are no constraints for places to install, ordinarily, a site is considered as a possibility if it is one where transmission loss is minimized or where voltage or frequency can he easily controlled by setting up storage facilities. If storage facilities are installed at load buses, electric power would be maintained by supply from the storage facilities to the loads, even when outage should occur at the power source side of the buses in question. In this paper, the authors propose a method to determine the arrangement of storage facilities, {{for the objective of}} minimizing the cost of interruption of electrical service, assuming that the facilities are installed at load buses. The problem is formulated and solved by using the dynamic programming method. From the examples, it is confirmed that we can reduce the cost of interruption by the ratio of (maximum output) /(interrupted load), if the corresponding maximum capacity is 2 〜 5 times larger than the mean <b>outage</b> <b>duration</b> time, and also it is confirmed that it is better to install larger storage facilities for larger capacity loads and for loads with larger mean <b>outage</b> <b>duration</b> time...|$|E

The purpose of the analysis was to establish {{a relationship between the}} length of a power outage and its yearly frequency.

The information was developed from data contained in unusual occurrence reports (UORs) spanning a continuous period of 19. 75 years. The average frequency of power loss calculated from the UOR information is 1. 22 events per year. The mean of the power loss duration is 32. 5 minutes an the median duration is 2 minutes. Nine events resulted in loss of power to both 200 East and 200 West areas simultaneously. Seven events (not necessarily the same events that resulted in loss of power to both 200 areas) resulted in <b>outage</b> <b>durations</b> exceeding 5 minutes.

By {{becoming more and more}} dependent on the voltage sensitive electronic equipment, the industry sector is the one which is affected the most by voltage disturbances.

40|$|Fast {{restoration}} of critical loads and non-black-start generators can {{significantly reduce the}} economic losses caused by power system blackouts. In a parallel power system restoration scenario, the sectionalization of restoration subsystems plays {{a very important role}} in determining the pickup of critical loads before synchronization. Most existing research mainly focuses on the startup of non-black-start generators. The {{restoration of}} critical loads, especially the loads with cold load characteristics, has not yet been addressed in optimizing the subsystem divisions. As a result, sectionalized restoration subsystems cannot achieve the best coordination between the pickup of loads and the ramping of generators. In order to generate sectionalizing strategies considering the pickup of critical loads in parallel power system restoration scenarios, an optimization model considering power system constraints, the characteristics of the cold load pickup and the features of generator startup is proposed in this paper. A bi-level programming approach is employed to solve the proposed sectionalizing model. In the upper level the optimal sectionalizing problem for the restoration subsystems is addressed, while in the lower level the objective is to minimize the <b>outage</b> <b>durations</b> of critical loads. The proposed sectionalizing model has been validated by the New-England 39 -bus system and the IEEE 118 -bus system. Further comparisons with some existing methods are carried out as well...|$|R
