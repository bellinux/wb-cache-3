5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection beyond the realm of race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud <b>of</b> <b>his</b> yellow <b>skin,</b> a Japanese <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brown <b>skin,</b> and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured.

I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|R
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed}} to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine {{that he was a}} nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{the rest of}} 1985 and early 1986 competing for New Japan Pro Wrestling, Snuka resurfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), replacing Jerry Blackwell as Greg Gagne's partner, to defeat Bruiser Brody and Nord the Barbarian in a tag team cage match at WrestleRock 86. Snuka split his time between the AWA and Japan throughout 1986 and 1987. His most notable feud in the AWA during that time was with Colonel DeBeers, who portrayed a racist and looked down on Snuka because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> color. This led {{the way for a}} series of grudge matches in 1987.|$|E
25|$|On February 10, 1993, Winfrey {{sat down}} with Michael Jackson for {{what would become the}} most-watched {{interview}} in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as vitiligo when asked about the change in the color <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.|$|E

25|$|Hart played {{football}} for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1937 to 1939 as a centre {{and was considered}} a standout performer at the time. He coached a women's fastball team in Edmonton during the late 1930s {{as well as being}} the captain of a popular baseball team called Hart's All Stars. The players of Hart's All Stars consisted of sheet-metal workers from Edmonton. On Christmas Eve 1941 Hart was almost killed from a bicycle accident which broke both his elbows and thumbs and hurt his back severely. The injuries risked ending Hart's athletic career. The accident had happened while he was on the way to his father Edward to celebrate Christmas with the family when a fire truck drove behind him and forced Hart to swerve to the side where he was hit by another car which propelled him thirty feet foreword on the road and scraped off a large portion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> in the process. He spent several months at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton recovering. In the spring, still hospitalized, Hart was visited by Al Oeming, a young neighbor who had been drafted into the Canadian Navy for World War II and after being released from the hospital Hart decided to enlist. Hart enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy and was appointed the position of Director of Athletics.|$|E
25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{wrote the}} opera's libretto, {{in the process}} cutting almost half of Wilde's play, {{stripping}} it down and emphasizing its basic dramatic structure. The structural form of Strauss's libretto is highly patterned, notably {{in the use of}} symmetry and the hierarchical grouping of events, passages, and sections in threes. Examples of three-part structure include Salome's attempt to seduce Narraboth, in order to get him to let her see Jochanaan. She tries to seduce him three times, and he capitulates on the third. When Jochanaan is brought before Salome he issues three prophecies, after which Salome professes love for Jochanaan three times—love <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> his hair, and his lips, the last of which results in Jochanaan cursing her. In the following scene Herod three times asks Salome to be with him—to drink, eat, and sit with him. She refuses each time. Later Herod asks her to dance for him, again three times. Twice she refuses, but the third time Herod swears to give her whatever she wants in return and she accepts. After she dances and says she wants Jochanaan's head on a platter, Herod, not wanting to execute the Prophet, makes three offers—an emerald, peacocks, and finally, desperately, the Veil of the Sanctuary of the Holy of Holies. Salome rejects all three offers, each time more stridently insisting on Jochanaan's head. Three-part groupings occur elsewhere on both larger and smaller levels.|$|E

500|$|Invincible is {{dedicated}} to the fifteen-year-old Afro-Norwegian boy Benjamin [...] "Benny" [...] Hermansen who was stabbed to death by a group of neo-Nazis in Oslo, Norway, in January 2001. The reason for this tribute was partly {{due to the fact that}} another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen. The dedication in the album reads, [...] "Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': This album {{is dedicated}} to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen. May we continue to remember not to judge man by the color <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> but the content of his Character. Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace."

500|$|The episode {{featured}} a few early character designs. Moe Szyslak has black hair in this episode, which was later changed to grey. Barney Gumble has yellow hair, which was later changed to brown {{in order to}} differentiate the character's hair color from that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> Because of the delayed airing, {{there are also a}} few continuity errors. Santa's Little Helper, for example, does not appear in this episode, despite being introduced in [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". Hank Azaria was at the time credited as a guest star for portraying Moe Szyslak. In this episode Moe was originally voiced by Christopher Collins, but when Azaria came with his version, they decided to overdub Collins' voice. Azaria became a regular cast member in the second season.|$|E
