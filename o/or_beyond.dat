5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided {{south of}} Hadrian's Wall in earnest in 342, 360, and 365 and they participated with the Attacotti in the Great Conspiracy of 367. Rome fought back, {{mounting}} a campaign under CountTheodosius in 369 which reëstablished a province which was renamed Valentia {{in honor of}} the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was mounted in 384, but both were short-lived successes. Rome had fully withdrawn from Britain by 410, never to return.|$|E
5|$|Between 27 and 34 RAF {{fighters were}} destroyed. A {{specialist}} {{source of the}} battle indicated the figure to be 31 destroyed <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> repair. Of these, 25 fell to German fighters, two to return fire from the bombers. One was shot down by British ground fire in error {{and the loss of}} the remainder cannot be established. Some 26 of the fighters lost were Hurricanes, and five were Spitfires. Personnel losses for the RAF amounted to 10 British fighter pilots killed on the day, and another who died of wounds. Around 19 pilots were wounded, 11 so seriously that they did not take part {{in the rest of the}} battle.|$|E

However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} first {{heard in the}} District Court. The appellants contended {{by way of a}} {{preliminary}} objection that Order 123 was ultra vires, <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> the powers, of the UPA and contravened Article 15(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which enshrines the right to freedom of religion. The trial judge dismissed the preliminary objection, holding that Order 123 was valid and constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for possession of the banned publications. They appealed to the High Court against the trial judge's decision.|$|E
5|$|Wander's horse, Agro, plays a {{large role}} in the game. In {{addition}} to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.|$|E

5|$|The Fountain is a 2006 American epic magical realism romantic drama {{film that}} blends {{elements}} of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. It {{is directed by}} Darren Aronofsky, and stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. The film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines—interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs—reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality.|$|E
5|$|The final island {{platform}} is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 {{is used by}} most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare <b>or</b> <b>beyond.</b> Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 {{that used to be}} the In/Out Road for Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot. This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding, the latter is often used to stable Mark 1 carriages between Torbay Express duties in the summer months. The Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys talamancae is a medium-sized, {{brightly colored}} rice rat. It {{is similar to}} T.bolivaris and the two are often confused. They are about as large, but in T.talamancae the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter. Both species share uniquely long vibrissae, with both the mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae {{extending}} to <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but those in T.bolivaris are substantially longer. H.alfaroi, a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador, is also similar. It is smaller and darker, but young adult T.talamancae are similar in color to adult H.alfaroi and often misidentified. Hylaeamys megacephalus, with which T.talamancae was synonymized for some decades, is similar in body size, but is not known to overlap with T.talamancae in range.|$|E

5|$|The Report to the Minister for Defence on the Collins class {{submarine}} {{and related}} matters (commonly {{referred to as}} the McIntosh-Prescott Report) was compiled in ten weeks, and released on 1 June 1999. This report concluded that the Collins class was incapable of performing at the required level for military operations. Although the report highlighted several elements of the submarine design that performed to <b>or</b> <b>beyond</b> expectations, and acknowledged that many of the publicised problems had been or {{were in the process of}} being fixed, it presented the propulsion system, combat system, and excessive noise as ongoing problems across the class. After identifying the combat system as the central problem, McIntosh and Prescott recommended that it be scrapped entirely and replaced with a system based on commercially available equipment and software. They also claimed that these problems were caused by poor design and manufacture; inappropriate design requirements; deficiencies in the structure of the contract, particularly with regards to modifying the contract to meet changing requirements; and problems between the various parties involved in the construction of the submarines, with a lack of overall direction and conflicts of interest causing avoidable hostility and uncooperativeness. Despite the report being promoted by the government as 'ground-breaking', many people involved with the Collins-class project later claimed that large sections of the report could have been copied from reports previously submitted by the RAN or ASC.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, <b>or</b> <b>beyond,</b> its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
