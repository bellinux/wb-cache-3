For instance, Elmer Davis, {{who wanted to}} “see that the American people are truthfully informed,” clashed with the military that withheld information for “public safety”. Further, OWI employees grew evermore dissatisfied with “what they regarded as a {{turn away from the}} fundamental, complex issues of the war in favor of manipulation and stylized exhortation”. On April 14, 1943, several OWI writers resigned from office and released a scathing statement to the press explaining how they no longer felt they could give an objective picture of the war because “high-pressure promoters who prefer slick salesmanship to honest information” dictated OWI decision-making.

50|$|In effect, Bundy had {{the first}} and last words on policy. He worked in close {{proximity}} to the President who valued highly his competence and opinions; he served on most major ad hoc committees and the Executive Committee, and he attended the occasional formal meetings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Security Council. It is possible to overemphasize Bundy's substantive skewing of Presidential policy formulation. Most observers credited him with being scrupulously fair in presenting <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> to <b>the</b> President, even when they conflicted with his own. He offered his views to Kennedy only when specifically asked. Bundy's influence was oblique rather than direct. Essentially, he served an administrative function and did not seek to advance a personal overview of American security and foreign policy. The most significant aspect of Bundy's tenure as Kennedy's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs was that he headed an aggressive Presidential staff that believed its job was to protect the President's interests, provide him with independent advice, and lead a recalcitrant bureaucracy toward his policies. In addition, Bundy was an effective channel to the President for his activist staff.|$|R

40|$|In the west, {{producers}} {{often find}} themselves working with a federal agency {{in some sort of}} partnership. In public land areas, the most common relationship revolves around United States Forest Service (USFS) or Bureau of Land Management (BLM) grazing permits.

Maximum water level at <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected bridges is determined under extreme conditions of a Category 5 Hurricane making landfall on the island. The maximum wave height and wave period are estimated theoretically {{based on the}} highest water level. Several different scenarios are considered for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected bridges. The wave loads on the bridges are calculated by use of several theoretical methods. One is based on Euler’s equations coupled with <b>the</b> Volume <b>of</b> Fluid method, for which OpenFOAM, an open access computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package is used to perform the computations, and another one {{is based on the}} Green-Naghdi (Level I) nonlinear shallow water wave equations, and is applied to the cases in which the bridge is fully submerged. Existing theoretical and empirical relations, including the Long-Wave Approximation for a fully submerged bridge, developed based on the linear potential theory, and the empirical relations for an elevated bridge deck are also used.

40|$|Objective: Recently, {{a vaccine}} with the {{capacity}} to protect against serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease received a positive <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Medicines <b>Agency.</b> Previously, such a vaccine {{was estimated to be}} cost-effective. However, since then, the MenB disease incidence has declined drastically in the Netherlands. Therefore, we re-assessed the potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating infants in the Netherlands with a MenB vaccine. Methods:A cohort of 185, 000 Dutch newborns was followed in a Markov model to compare routine vaccination against MenB disease with no vaccination. The ICER was estimated for different disease incidences. The study was performed from a societal perspective. Results:Routine infant vaccination (2, 3, 4 + 11 mo) could prevent 39 cases of MenB disease in a single birth cohort, corresponding to a total gain of 133 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective if the vaccine costs Euro 40 per dose (Euro 243, 778 per QALY). At a disease incidence of 5. 7 per 100, 000 person-years or a vaccine price of Euro 10 per dose including administration costs, the ICER becomes more acceptable and remains below a threshold of Euro 50, 000 per QALY. Conclusions:At the current low level of disease incidence, introduction of routine infant vaccination, following a 2, 3, 4 + 11 mo schedule, against MenB disease is unlikely cost-effective in the Netherlands. If the MenB disease incidence increases or the vaccine price is substantially lower than Euro 40, routine infant vaccination {{has the potential to be}} cost-effective. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to develop and test an {{instrument}} to measure client satisfaction among families who are clients of a child protective services <b>agency.</b> With <b>the</b> growing numbers <b>of</b> families coming into contact with CPS <b>agencies,</b> <b>the</b> burgeoning numbers <b>of</b> children in foster care, and the increasing attention to <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> services within this population, client feedback is one approach that has been largely ignored by CSP administrators. The basic problem this dissertation addressed is <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> obtaining feedback from the involuntary client, such as the family in a child abuse case. Specifically, this dissertation addressed the following four research questions: 1. Can a client satisfaction instrument be developed for CPS clients largely through <b>the</b> input <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clients? 2. What are <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> satisfaction that are applicable to CPS families? 3. How much involvement do the CPS families feel that they have in the planning and decision-making in their cases? What impact does this have on their overall level of satisfaction? 4. What are the relationships among <b>the</b> various domains <b>of</b> satisfaction and <b>the</b> overall level <b>of</b> satisfaction? Two rounds of interviews were held with families who had been clients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CPS <b>agency</b> serving <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Oregon, Children 2 ̆ 7 s Services Division. These interviews served as <b>the</b> major source <b>of</b> information for <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> satisfaction domains and for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a closed-ended instrument to measure these domains. The responses to the interviews were content analyzed and four specific domains of client satisfaction were identified.
