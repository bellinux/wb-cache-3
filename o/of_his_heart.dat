White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. {{at the age of}} 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The medical {{certification}} of White's death stated the cause <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> failure was due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E

5|$|With 35 shotgun pellets {{still in}} his body, {{including}} three in the lining <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. He missed the Tour {{for the second year}} running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E

25|$|The {{story is}} set in a 19th-century-like England, in a small town called Draftingshire-Upon-Topsmart. An {{orphaned}} Pip {{is on his way to}} visit his parents' grave. While there, an escaped convict appears and threatens Pip. Pip, out of the goodness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> aids the convict by giving him food and cutting the convict's handcuffs. He then goes home, where his sister's husband Joe reads an advertisement about a Miss Havisham seeking a boy to play with her daughter. Pip goes and meets the daughter, Estella, who constantly insults him. Miss Havisham hires Pip and throughout their playtimes he eventually falls in love with Estella.|$|E

Spurred by the fan's recognition of him and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition. However, Randy explains to her that he belongs in the ring with the fans who, unlike the rest of society, love him.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reports of}} Savage's death {{indicated}} {{that he had been}} killed in the collision, when, in fact, {{he and his wife had}} been wearing seatbelts and suffered only minor physical injuries in the crash. An autopsy performed by the medical examiner's office found that he had an enlarged heart and advanced coronary artery disease (more than 90% narrowed). The drugs found in his system included a prescription painkiller and a small amount of alcohol. Savage had never been treated for heart problems and there was no evidence that he was aware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition. The cause of death was officially ruled as atherosclerotic heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{after failing}} to take {{antibiotics}} to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed an overwhelming systemic infection (sepsis). This further weakened his body and affected one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> valves. On December 11, he checked himself into Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971. On the evening of December 19, a five-man surgical team worked for over six hours to repair his damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended {{in the early morning}} hours of December 20, 1973, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was 37 years old.|$|E
25|$|That Susan was Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs is truly a love story. Love is not the subject of Citizen Kane.|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of World War II, Garfield {{immediately}} attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition. Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress Bette Davis were the driving forces behind {{the opening of the}} Hollywood Canteen, a club offering food and entertainment for American servicemen. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several bond selling tours and starred in a string of popular, patriotic films like Air Force, Destination Tokyo and Pride of the Marines (all box office successes). He was particularly proud of the last film, based on the life of Al Schmid, a war hero blinded in combat. In preparing for the role, Garfield lived for several weeks with Schmid and his wife in Philadelphia and would blindfold himself for hours at a time.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> the Doctor found himself {{locked in a}} desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One – the Big Bang – that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating {{a plan that would}} effectively wipe out free will itself.|$|E
25|$|Queen Beatrice was widowed in 1272. The {{couple had}} no children. Her husband was buried {{next to his}} second wife, Sanchia of Provence, but Beatrice may have {{organised}} the burial <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> at the Franciscan church at Greyfriars, Oxford. She led an extremely low-profile life, almost disappearing from historical records. Her brother-in-law, King Henry III of England, sent her gifts in 1272, as did her nephew, King Edward I, in 1276. She was at odds with her stepson, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, over part of his mother Sanchia's dower, but that was settled in February 1276. A portrait of Beatrice in stained glass, the oldest undamaged still existing donor portrait, was made by Norwich Greyfriars and {{is now part of}} the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. It was thought to originate from the Franciscan church in Oxford, which would have indicated that Beatrice was a significant benefactress to the order. This is the only indication that Beatrice donated to the Church. She died aged 23 on 17 October 1277. She was buried at Greyfriars, Oxford, as queen of Germany.|$|E

25|$|On , John {{returned}} from the Hieronymites Monastery where he had lunched and retired to Bemposta Palace feeling poorly. He was racked for several days by symptoms including vomiting and convulsions. He appeared to be getting better, but by way of prudence designated his daughter, the infanta Isabel Maria, as regent. On the night of 9 March, he took {{a turn for the}} worse and died at approximately 5 a.m. on the 10th. The infanta immediately assumed the internal government of Portugal, and Pedro was recognized as the legitimate heir as Dom Pedro IV of Portugal. Doctors could not definitively determine a cause of death, but it was suspected that he had been poisoned. His body was embalmed and buried in the mausoleum of the kings of Portugal, the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora. In the 1990s, a team of investigators exhumed the Chinese ceramic pot that contained his bowels. Fragments <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> were rehydrated and submitted to an analysis that detected enough arsenic to kill two people, confirming longstanding suspicions of assassination by poison.|$|E
500|$|The text, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and {{professor}} of Philosophy, is particularly beautiful {{in the way it}} describes the self-realized man who [...] "feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with God (Shiva, highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
