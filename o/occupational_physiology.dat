For the effect of walking, datasets could be merged and a single prediction equation produced (r 2 = 0. 91). For the effect of wind, and interaction of movement and wind, separate equations were required for regular workwear (r 2 = 0. 93) and cold-weather clothing (r 2 = 0. 97). Differences were mainly due to the different amounts of nude surface area. An interaction between wind and walking effects was present (the size of the combined effects is less than the sum of the separate effects), and for cold-weather clothing an effect of clothing air permeability (p) was present (high p→bigger effect). The resulting prediction equations will be proposed for inclusion in European and ISO standards on protective clothing to assist the user in determining the real-life clothing insulation value...|$|E

Despite all technological and physiological advances, limited research has been performed addressing the translation of standardized, relevant laboratory tests into the field and consequently into “real world” cycling (i. e.. (i. e. González-Haro et al., 2007 : British Journal of Sports Medicine, 41 (3), 174 – 179; Quod et al., 2010 :InterInternational Journal of Sports Medicine, 31 (6), 397 – 401; Nimmerichter et al., 2010 : International Journal of Sports Medicine, 31 (3), 160 - 166). For continuous activities between approximately 2 and 30 minutes, the assessment of Critical Power (CP) is one such relevant test. Compromising ecological validity, to date CP testing is mostly constrained to the laboratory. Purpose: To investigate a novel CP road testing protocol. Methods: Laboratory determined CP values using a 30 min intra-trial recovery period (Bishop & Jenkins, 1995 : European Journal of Applied Physiology and <b>Occupational</b> <b>Physiology,</b> 72 (1 - 2), 115 - 120) were compared with those determined in the field, i. e. on the road.

The aim {{of the study was}} to conduct a scoping review of studies into the application of or attitudes towards ehealth amongst allied health professionals conducted in Australia. Methods Studies meeting inclusion criteria published from January 2004 to June 2015 were reviewed. Professions included were audiology, dietetics, exercise <b>physiology,</b> <b>occupational</b> therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, social work, and speech pathology. Terms for these professions and forms of ehealth were combined in databases of CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (1806 – Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid) and AMED (Ovid). Results Forty-four studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarised. They were either trials of aspects of ehealth service delivery, or clinician and/or client use of and attitudes towards ehealth. Trials of ehealth were largely from two research groups located at the Universities of Sydney and Queensland; most involved speech pathology and physiotherapy. Assessments through ehealth and intervention outcomes through ehealth were comparable with face-to-face delivery. Clinicians used ICT mostly for managing their work and for professional development, but were reticent about its use in service delivery, which contrasted with the more positive attitudes and experiences of clients. Conclusion The potential of ehealth to address allied health needs of Australians living in rural and remote Australia appears unrealised. Clinicians may need to embrace ehealth as a means to radicalise practice, rather than replicate existing practices through a different mode of delivery.

40|$|Clinical {{experience}}, {{or experience}} in the ‘real world’ of practice, is a fundamental component of many health professional courses. It often involves students undertaking practical experience in clinical workplace settings, typically referred to as clinical placements, {{under the supervision of}} health professionals. Broadly speaking, the role of clinical supervisors, or teachers, is aimed at assisting students to integrate the theoretical and skills based components of the curriculum within the context of patient/client care (Erstzen et al 2009). Clinical experience also provides students with the opportunity to assimilate the attitudes, values and skills which they require to become appropriately skilled professionals in the environments in which they will eventually practise. However, clinical settings are particularly challenging learning environments for students. Unlike classroom learning, students in the clinical setting frequently find themselves involved in unplanned and often complex activities with patients and other health care providers, being supervised by a variety of clinical staff who have very different methods and styles of teaching, and negotiating bureaucratic or hierarchical structures in busy clinical workplaces where they may only be spending a limited amount of time. Kilminster et al (2007) also draw attention to tensions that may exist between the learning needs of students and the provision of quality care or need to prevent harm to the patient (e. g. Elkind et al 2007). All of these factors complicate the realisation of clinical education goals and underscore the need for effective clinical teaching practices that maximise student learning in clinical environments. This report provides a summary of work that has been achieved in relation to ALTC projects and fellowships associated with clinical teaching, and a review of scholarly publications relevant to this field. The report also makes recommendations based on issues identified and/or where further work is indicated. The projects and fellowships reviewed cover a range of discipline areas including Biology, Paramedic Practice, Clinical Exercise <b>Physiology,</b> <b>Occupational</b> Therapy, Speech Pathology, Physiotherapy, Pharmacy, Nursing and Veterinary Science. The main areas of focus cover issues related to curriculum, particularly in relation to industry expectations of ‘work-ready’ graduates and the implications for theoretical and practical, or clinical preparation; development of competency assessment tools that are nationally applicable across discipline-specific courses; and improvement of clinical learning through strategies targeting the clinical learning environment, building the teaching capacity of clinical supervisors and/or enhancing the clinical learning/teaching process...|$|R

Purpose To characterise the acute impact of two common HIT protocols on EE and post-exercise oxygen consumption (11 h EPOC). Methods Oxygen consumption (l min− 1), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and EE were measured in nine healthy, lean males over 12 h under three conditions: control (CON), HIT 1 (10 × 1 min high-intensity cycling bouts followed by 1 min rest) and HIT 2 (10 × 4 min high-intensity cycling bouts followed by 2 min rest). Results Total exercise period EE during HIT 1 (1, 151 ± 205 kJ) (mean ± SD) was significantly lower than HIT 2 (2, 788 ± 322 kJ; p < 0. 001). EE within the 60 min after exercise was significantly albeit marginally higher after HIT 1 (388 ± 44 kJ; p = 0. 02) and HIT 2 (389 ± 39 kJ; p = 0. 01) compared with CON (329 ± 39 kJ), with no difference between exercise conditions (p = 0. 778). RER during this period was significantly lower in HIT 1 (0. 78 ± 0. 06; p = 0. 011) and HIT 2 (0. 76 ± 0. 04; p = 0. 004) compared with CON (0. 87 ± 0. 06).

A parallel study was conducted to determine the possibility of measuring IL- 6 in sweat using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and investigate the relationship between plasma- and sweat-derived measures of IL- 6. Methods: Twelve male participants were recruited for the measurement of IL- 6 at rest and during exercise (study 1). An additional group of five female participants was recruited for the measurement of IL- 6 in venous blood versus sweat at rest and following exercise (study 2). In study 1, venous and capillary blood samples were collected at rest and in response to exercise. In study 2, venous and sweat samples were collected following exercise. Results: Mean plasma IL- 6 concentration was not different between venous and capillary blood sampling methods either at rest (4. 27 ± 5. 40 vs. 4. 14 ± 4. 45 pg ml− 1), during (5. 40 ± 5. 17 vs. 5. 58 ± 6. 34 pg ml− 1), or in response to exercise (6. 95 ± 6. 37 vs. 6. 99 ± 6. 74 pg ml− 1). There was no IL- 6 detectable in sweat either at rest or following exercise. Conclusion: There are no differences in the measurement of plasma IL- 6 using either venous or capillary blood sampling methods. Capillary measurement represents a minimally invasive way of measuring IL- 6 and detecting changes in IL- 6, which are linked to fatigue and overtraining...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] The original publication is available at www. springerlink. comSeveral studies investigating the effect of caffeine on immune function following exercise have used one large bolus dose of caffeine. However, this does not model typical caffeine consumption. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether small repeated doses of caffeine ingested throughout the day would elicit a similar response as one large bolus dose ingested 1 h prior to exercise on antigen-stimulated NK cell CD 69 expression following strenuous intermittent exercise. In a randomized cross-over design, 15 healthy males completed six 15 min blocks of intermittent running consisting of maximal sprinting interspersed with less intense running and walking. Participants had ingested either 0 (PLA), 2 mg kg− 1 body mass (BM) caffeine on three separate occasions during the day (3 × CAF) or one dose of 6 (1 × CAF) mg kg− 1 BM caffeine, 1 h before exercise. At 1 -h post-exercise, the number of antigen-stimulated CD 3 −CD 56 + cells expressing CD 69 was lower on 1 × CAF compared with PLA [P < 0. 05; PLA: 42. 0 (34. 0) × 106 cells L− 1, 1 × CAF: 26. 2 (25. 0) × 106 cells L− 1], with values on 1 × CAF at this time point remaining close to pre-supplement. 1 × CAF tended to attenuate the exercise-induced increase in geometric mean fluorescence intensity of CD 69 expression on antigen-stimulated CD 3 −CD 56 + cells 1 -h post-exercise [P = 0. 055; PLA: 141 (28) %, 1 × CAF: 119 (20) %]. These findings suggest that although one large bolus dose of caffeine attenuated the exercise-induced increase in antigen-stimulated NK cell CD 69 expression 1 h following strenuous intermittent exercise, this attenuation at no point fell below pre-supplement values and caffeine does not appear to depress NK cell CD 69 expression...|$|E
