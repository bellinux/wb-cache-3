Historically, the term [...] "album" [...] was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format.

Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound).

Panasonic introduced P2 cameras. These recorded a DVCPro signal on interchangeable flash memory media. Several other data storage device recording systems were introduced, notably XDCAM from Sony. Sony also introduced SxS (S-by-S), a flash memory standard compliant to the Sony and Sandisk-created ExpressCard standard.

Moreover high signal-to-noise ratio can be reached as well as high resolutions. We present the results obtained by pulsed holographic interferometry obtained with photorefractive crystals. First experiments showing the potentiality of photorefractive crystals for such applications will be reviewed. Some limitations were pointed out and led us to consider new developments under the frame of an European-funded project. The PHIFE European project (Pulsed Holographic Interferometer {{for the analysis of}} Fast Events) aims at developing a full field measurement system at a high repetition rate, based on a double-pulse YAG Q-switch laser. This device will be used for the analysis of vibrations and for aerodynamic studies. Different crystals are considered which are adapted to the fundamental line of the YAG (AsGa or CdTe crystals) or after frequency doubling at 532 nm (Bi/sub 12 /SiO /sub 20 /). Different crystal configurations and recording geometries are compared. Also different innovative phase quantification techniques are studied and take into account some special properties of the PRCs.

40|$|Abstract: Combining the {{advantages}} of hard-disk magnetic recording and magneto-optical recording, hybrid recording is regarded as promising candidate for extremely-high density recording technology beyond Tera bits/in 2.
