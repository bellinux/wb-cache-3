25|$|Dylan's {{historical}} stature, {{as well as}} his renewed {{critical acclaim}} following Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> and Love and Theft, helped to make Modern Times a highly anticipated release. As with Love and Theft in 2001, Sony held a listening event for critics far in advance, but those invited were forbidden from disclosing details or opinions about what they heard prior to the official release.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} Dylan's May 1997 health scare, {{a number of}} columnists, {{including}} Dylanologist A.J. Weberman, speculated that the songs on Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> were inspired by an increased awareness of his own mortality. This was {{despite the fact that}} all of the songs were completed, recorded, and even mixed before he was hospitalized. In interviews following its release, Dylan dismissed these speculations.|$|E

25|$|By late 1984, Models {{relocated}} to Sydney and Duffield– with his crucial {{influence on the}} band's sound– was forced out under acrimonious circumstances {{to be replaced by}} Roger Mason (ex- James Freud's Berlin) on keyboards and James Valentine on saxophone. In early 1985, Models started recording material for their next album, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind,</b> Out of Sight, produced by Mark Opitz, Reggie Lucas and Nick Launay. In October 2010, The Pleasure of Your Company was listed in the top50 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.|$|E
25|$|For {{some fans}} and critics, the album marked Dylan's artistic {{comeback}} after {{he appeared to}} struggle with his musical identity throughout the 1980s; he had not released any original material for seven years, since Under the Red Sky in 1990. Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> is hailed as one of Dylan's best albums, and it {{went on to win}} three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year in 1998. It was also ranked number 408 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Spark In The Dark was {{published}} by Thin Man Press. This first collection of Constable's poetry ranges from satirical Burlesques to lyrical Spirit Songs. In Mrs God the poet draws on his Welsh Borders upbringing in a “burlesque” that comically subverts {{the image of a}} Divine patriarch. The book also features two experimental prose-poems. Winchester Cathedral:Time <b>Out</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Mind,</b> written during an Arts Council residency at Winchester Cathedral, evokes the misadventures of a medieval monk troubled by visions of the future. Wennefer is “a cautionary tale”, a visceral retelling of the Isis-Osiris myth set in south London club culture.|$|E

25|$|Back in Los Angeles, Australian singer Glenn Shorrock (ex-Little River Band) {{asked her}} to provide backing vocals on his solo album Villain of the Peace (1982) and to join him on his {{subsequent}} six-week tour of Australia in 1983. Matthews decided to stay in Sydney at the tour's completion and found herself in demand as a session vocalist and singing jingles. She sang on albums by Jimmy Barnes, Richard Clapton, Tim Finn and Icehouse. After singing backing vocals on Models' 1985 album <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind,</b> Out of Sight, she became a regular vocalist for the band. Matthews and Models' guitarist and vocalist, Sean Kelly, had an 11-year personal relationship. Other backing singers for Models included Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne, both members of I'm Talking – the two bands often toured together. In 1986, Matthews joined Peter Blakeley and The Resurrection, with Blakeley (ex-Rockmelons) on lead vocals, Chris Abrahams on bass guitar and piano (ex-The Benders), Jim Benjamin on drums and Mark Punch on guitar (Renée Geyer Band). Her second album with Models, Models' Media appeared in December which reached the top30.|$|E
500|$|In September Dylan {{released}} the new Lanois-produced album, Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind.</b> With its bitter assessment {{of love and}} morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: [...] "the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years." [...] This collection of complex songs won him his first solo [...] "Album of the Year" [...] Grammy Award.|$|E
500|$|On August 29, 2006, Dylan {{released}} his Modern Times album. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing {{on the album}} as [...] "a catarrhal death rattle") most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> and [...] "Love and Theft". Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire. The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times {{and the work of}} the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.|$|E

500|$|In the World Tonight, a {{film about}} {{the making of the}} album, was {{broadcast}} in the UK on ITV, and on VH1 in the US, around the release of the album. Also broadcast was an hour-long radio show about the album on 5 May 1997 on BBC Radio 2. It received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, although Bob Dylan won the award with his back-to-form album Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind.</b> [...] "Young Boy" [...] and [...] "The World Tonight" [...] appeared in the 1997 Ivan Reitman comedy Fathers' Day. The title Flaming Pie (also given to one of the album's songs) is a reference to a humorous story John Lennon told in a story in Mersey Beat in 1961 on the origin of The Beatles' name: [...] "It came in a vision – a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them, 'from this day on you are Beatles with an A.'

2500|$|Some critics criticized Lanois' {{production}} on Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind.</b> Allmusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, [...] "...Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> has a grittier foundation—by and large, {{the songs are}} bitter and resigned, and Dylan gives them appropriately anguished performances. Lanois bathes them in hazy, ominous sounds, which may suit {{the spirit of the}} lyrics, but are often in opposition to Dylan's performances." [...] Michael Gray writes, [...] "The sound is elsewhere unhelpful too on Time <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind.</b> Some tracks have Dylan so buried in echo that there is no hope of hearing the detailing in his voice that was once so central and diamondlike a part of his genius." ...|$|E
