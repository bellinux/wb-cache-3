500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Eather, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by sappers of the 2/1st Field Company carrying Bangalore torpedoes— pipes packed with ammonal—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a Bangalore torpedo, resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at [...] intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their failure}} to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other {{radicals}} sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the melee. He was among the arrested, and the [...] "Boston riot" [...] received national press coverage. [...] Trotter later claimed {{that there was no}} plan to break up the meeting. Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimké, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity. After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.|$|E

Deep lines {{appeared}} on his forehead; for it is an awful thing for a football enthusiast to be compelled to applaud, in the very middle of the Cup-ties, purely by means of facial expression. In this time of affliction he found Isabel an ever-increasing comfort to him. Side by side they would sit, and the old man's face would lose its drawn look, and light up, as her clear young soprano pealed out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> urging this player to shoot, that to kick some opponent in the face; or describing the referee {{in no uncertain terms}} as a reincarnation of the late Mr Dick Turpin.|$|E

Early records of shipboard fifes and drums confirm this proven method of delivering orders <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle. The sea chantey united the voices as it coordinated the efforts of the crew. There were special varieties for specific tasks from hoisting the mainsail to weighing anchor. After-hours entertainment featured the chantey in sentimental thoughts of home and often humorous speculation about their next adventure.|$|E

5000|$|In 1529 Johannes Wnorowius (Jan Wnorowski) {{became the}} first Polish-speaking preacher at the Steindamm church. Seclucianus (Jan Seklucjan) {{translated}} the New Testament into Polish there during the 1540s. Lithuanian-speaking preachers included Bartholomeus Willentius (Wilentis, died 1587) in 1554 and his successor, Johann Bretke. Sharing of the church caused disputes between the Poles and Lithuanians, however, and the pastors could sometimes not hear themselves <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> After the death of Bretke in 1602, the Poles increased their efforts to control the church. In 1603 the Protestant Lithuanians received St. Elizabeth's Church in Sackheim for themselves, after the Catholic Jesuits had become interested in the situation.|$|E
5000|$|Cornstalk's forces {{attacked}} Lewis's {{camp where}} the Kanawha River joins the Ohio River, hoping to trap him along a bluff.

Cornstalk's voice was reportedly heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the battle, urging his warriors to [...] "be strong." [...] Lewis sent several companies along the Kanawha and up a nearby creek to attack the Indians from the rear, which reduced {{the intensity of the}} Shawnee offensive. Captain George Mathews was credited with a flanking maneuver that initiated Cornstalk's retreat. At nightfall, the Shawnees quietly withdrew back across the Ohio. The Virginians had held their ground, and thus are considered to have won.|$|E

5000|$|The {{homecoming}} for the Wexford senior team {{along with}} their intermediate colleagues on Monday Sept 12th was in two stages, to Enniscorthy and Wexford town.

50|$|It {{was also}} {{believed}} that efficient heat transfer between {{the sides of the}} planet necessitates atmospheric circulation of an atmosphere so thick as to disallow photosynthesis. Due to differential heating, it was argued, a tidally locked planet would experience fierce winds with permanent torrential rain at the point directly facing the local star, the subsolar point. In the opinion of one author this makes complex life improbable. Plant life would have to adapt to the constant gale, for example by anchoring securely into the soil and sprouting long flexible leaves that do not snap. Animals would rely on infrared vision, as signaling by calls or scents would be difficult <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the planet-wide gale. Underwater life would, however, be protected from fierce winds and flares, and vast blooms of black photosynthetic plankton and algae could support the sea life.|$|E
5000|$|After Missie again {{fails to}} rescue Jacob, Belinda runs away with {{him into the}} stormy night. Everyone joins a desperate search for them. Amid the lightning-laden thunderstorm, Zach prays. He then hears a voice <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> and follows it to the {{abandoned}} mine where the children have sought shelter. Zach tells Missie it was God’s miracle that guided him in the wilderness, but as she later admits to her father, she doesn’t know how to [...] "let go" [...] of her late husband. Clark tells her love doesn’t die when a person passes away; it stays in a person's heart forever as she moves on to a new life with a new chance for happiness. Missie takes that chance by marrying Zach. They adopt Jacob as well and begin their lives as a family of five.|$|E

5000|$|Located {{near the}} center of the Promenade area, the Tunnel of Fun was a [...] "dark boat ride", where patrons were beckoned by the voice of a {{mechanical}} Red Devil to board and ride, unrestrained, a small wooden boat at the base of a large, wooden, functional waterwheel, which forced a steady stream of water that slowly propelled the boats through a mostly dark, quiet, meandering tunnel. At various stages of the trip, the passing boat would trigger lighted scenes of [...] "fright" [...] and sound intended to surprise and startle the travelers, eliciting many shrieks and laughter which could sometimes be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the waterwheel by the waiting or passing crowd outside. The beckoning Red Devil was situated in a glass covered pocket high up in the wall, to the observer's left of the large waterwheel, and for a time, was accompanied by a [...] "Laffing Sam" [...] who occupied a similar niche on the right side of the wheel.

60|$|Hour by {{hour the}} waves {{increased}} {{in size and}} violence, and often poured in <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sides. The number of men on board was too great for all to work effectively.

Wulf preferred working to lying still, for as the craft rolled <b>the</b> water washed <b>over</b> them, while <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of <b>the</b> waves striking the ship's side, and the cataracts of spray falling on to the canvas above were deafening, and it was impossible to get a moment's sleep. All were glad when morning broke, although the scene that met their eyes was the reverse of comforting. Small as was the amount of sail the vessel tore through the water under the pressure of the following wind. Great waves with white crests pursued her, and as they neared her stern it seemed to Wulf that they must inevitably fall over and crush her. The spray torn from the crest by the wind filled the air. The wind shrieked in the cordage, and the vessel creaked and groaned as she rolled from side to side.|$|R
5000|$|InApril 1916 - Everything {{is being}} hurried up.

5000|$|Early in {{development}} the Heer {{settled on the}} concept of the tank having a commander who was in radio communication with his superiors. Thus the basic design of the main battle tanks called for a larger turret that would house the tank commander, gunner and loader, while a driver and a machine gunner were down in the hull. Guderian insisted on the tank commander being in radio communication with both his platoon and with the members of his own tank crew. Thus the tanks had both a high frequency radio and an intercom system to allow communication <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle. Though the Panzer III was conceived as the main battle tank of the Wehrmacht, the Wehrmacht did not anticipate being at war with Europe's major powers in 1939, and few were available {{at the start of the}} war. [...] Excluding Czech built tanks, on 1 September 1939 the invasion of Poland was undertaken with the German armoured force of 3,195 tanks evenly split between the Pz I training tank and the Pz II light tank, with 1,145 Pz Is, 1,226 Pz IIs. Of the main battle tanks, only 98 Pz IIIs were in service during the invasion of Poland, along with 211 Pz IVs, with 215 tanks of various models also available as command tanks after being modified by having their main armament removed and extra communications equipment installed.|$|E
50|$|Most fife {{and drum}} traditions trace {{back to the}} Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and {{it is known that}} by the early 16th century, each company of {{infantry}} soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player. These two musicians would march {{at the head of the}} company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.As time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level. They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.|$|E
5000|$|After such a {{powerful}} negative reaction, Veloso was unsure whether {{to appear in the}} second round on 15 September, but his manager convinced him to go on, and this chaotic performance was recorded live and later released as a single. The students in the audience began hissing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, even before he had even taken the stage. Wearing the same green costume (minus the wires and necklaces), Veloso came on with Os Mutantes amid a storm of catcalls, and the group launched into a provocative new song Veloso had written for the occasion, [...] "É Proibido Proibir" [...] ("It is Forbidden to Forbid"), the title of which he had taken from a photo of a Parisian protest poster, which he had seen reproduced in a local magazine. The booing and jeering was soon so loud that Veloso struggled to be heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> and he again deliberately taunted the leftists with his sexualised stage actions. Within a short time the performers were being pelted with fruit, vegetables, eggs and a rain of paper balls, and a section of the audience expressed their disapproval by standing up and turning their backs to the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to respond in kind by turning their backs on the audience. Infuriated by the students' reaction, Veloso stopped singing and launched into a furious improvised monologue, haranguing the students for their behaviour and denouncing what he saw as their cultural conservatism. He was then joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support for Veloso, and as the tumult reached a crescendo, Veloso announced he was withdrawing from the competition, and after deliberately finishing the song out of tune, the Tropicalistas defiantly walked offstage, arm-in-arm.|$|E
