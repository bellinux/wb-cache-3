5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation <b>of</b> <b>creative</b> solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E

Through observations and recording changes at integrating a creative movement in the classroom, positive effects <b>of</b> a <b>creative</b> movement on a hypoactive student were noticed. The results show positive effects on the student behavior and cooperation in the classroom. ...|$|R
