5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack <b>of</b> <b>simple</b> connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack <b>of</b> <b>simple</b> connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

40|$|The {{modified}} method <b>of</b> <b>simplest</b> {{equation is}} {{powerful tool for}} obtaining exact and approximate solutions of nonlinear PDEs. These solutions are constructed {{on the basis of}} solutions <b>of</b> more <b>simple</b> equations called simplest equations. In this paper we study the role <b>of</b> the <b>simplest</b> equation for the application of the modified method <b>of</b> <b>simplest</b> equation. We follow the idea that each function constructed as polynomial of a solution <b>of</b> a <b>simplest</b> equation is a solution of a class of nonlinear PDEs. We discuss three simplest equations: the equations of Bernoulli and Riccati and the elliptic equation. The applied algorithm is as follows. First a polynomial function is constructed on the basis <b>of</b> a <b>simplest</b> equation. Then we find nonlinear ODEs that have the constructed function as a particular solution. Finally we obtain nonlinear PDEs that by means of the traveling-wave ansatz can be reduced to the above ODEs. By means of this algorithm we make a first step towards identification of the above-mentioned classes of nonlinear PDEs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification <b>of</b> <b>simple</b> Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations <b>of</b> <b>simple</b> Lie algebras, the path that will be followed here, was completed by Élie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935–38 {{largely responsible for the}} {{development of}} the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.|$|E
