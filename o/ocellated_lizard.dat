25|$|Lizards turn up {{with some}} {{regularity}} as prey {{in some of the}} hotter, drier portions of the golden eagle's range. In Europe, lizards made up to 13% of the prey remains in the French Pyrenees and 12.7% in the Italian Apennines. Fairly large lizards, including the monitor lizard, make the most significant contribution to the golden eagle diet. The most important lizard prey in Europe is the Lacerta genus, i.e. the <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta lepida). Spiny-tailed lizards of the genus Uromastyx are also of particular note in the golden eagle's diet; they are reportedly the single most important prey for golden eagles in Northeast Africa. In the particularly sparse Negev Desert of Israel, the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard (Uromastyx aegyptia) apparently comprised 89% of the diet, the most a single species has been reported to dominate a golden eagle's diet locally.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} in {{association}} with a woodchat shrike (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The woodchat shrike perches {{near the top of}} a tree, ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the scrub robin perches on a bush or lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizards</b> and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed scrub robin can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ocellated</b> flat <b>lizards</b> eat beetles {{and plant}} matters (flowers, leaves, and seeds). They lay two eggs in October or November which are laid communally with other females within {{cracks in the}} rocks. The {{compressed}} shape of their bodies allows them to shelter in cracks in rocks and other crevices. They are gregarious and {{can be seen in}} groups. However males engage in competition over space and access to females and display by exposing their brightly colored bellies by tilting sideways, or lift the head and shoulders up on stiffened front legs, showing off the bright colours of the throat and chest.|$|R
50|$|El Torcal {{supports}} {{an impressive}} array of wildflowers including rock-dwellers like Linaria anticaria, Saxifraga biternata, Linaria oblongifolia, Viola demetria, Saxifraga reuterana, Polypodium australe, and other plants like lilies, nazarenes, red peonies, wild rose trees and thirty varieties of orchid. The many species of reptiles include the Montpellier snake and <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard,</b> both endemic to El Torcal. Other life includes the Griffon vulture, the Spanish Ibex (Andalusian mountain goat), and nocturnal mammals such as badgers, weasels and rodents.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} species of lizard {{in the nature}} reserve, six snakes and an amphisbaenian. This last is a small, {{subterranean}} reptile that has no legs and no eyes. The most common lizard is the small green or brown Iberian wall lizard. The larger Algerian sand racer and the mainly nocturnal Moorish gecko are also common. Rarer lizards are the Turkish gecko and the <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard.</b> Snakes include the horseshoe whip snake, Montpellier snake, southern smooth snake, false smooth snake, grass snake and ladder snake.|$|E
50|$|In the park, over a {{thousand}} major plants and around thirty plant communities have been catalogued; including forests of Aleppo pines and nut pines, evergreen oaklands, riverside copses, maquis and scrublands, brush, and savannah grasslands. This diversity allows {{for the existence of}} a rich, varied wildlife; including wild boar, genets, stone marten, badger, rabbit, and squirrel; blue tits, whitethroats, treecreepers, woodpeckers, bee eaters, doves, goshawks, sparrow hawks, and rat-catching eagles; salamanders, newts, green tree frogs, the small southern frog, toads, the small spotted toad, the Mediterranean turtle, the giant turtle, the <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard,</b> snakes, and so on.|$|E
50|$|There are 28 {{species of}} trees. The lake's easily visible {{wildlife}} include birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, and mammals. Reptiles {{found in the}} park include the Iberian emerald lizard, the <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard,</b> and Mediterranean pond turtles. Mammals that reached it were the southwestern water voles and weasels. Common and easily visible birds are mallards, Egyptian geese, great cormorants, domestic geese and swans, much of which bred in the park. Other common species include blackbirds, the moorhen, the coot, the black-winged stilt, the magpie, and several other species. Making it a spot for birdwatchers who photograph other species such as the squacco heron, the cattle egret, the hoopoe, the gadwall, the northern shoveler, the wryneck, and the tufted duck.|$|E

50|$|In a few cases, {{northern}} goshawks {{have been}} recorded hunting and killing prey beyond birds and mammals. In some of the warmer drier extensions of their range, reptiles may be available to them to hunt. Only one species of snake is recorded from their diet, the small innocuous grass snake (Natrix natrix), at 66 g; however about a half dozen lizards are recorded in their diet, primarily from the Iberian peninsula {{but also from the}} Ural mountains and the American southwest. The only known location in the northern goshawk’s range where reptiles were taken in large numbers was Sierra de Guadarrama, Spain, where the 77 g <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard</b> (Timon lepidus) was the second most numerous prey species. Amphibians are even rarer in the diet, only recorded more than singly in one study each from Spain and from England. Fish are similarly rare in the diet, recorded twice each in Bavaria and Belarus. A few pellets have included remains of insects, much of which may be ingested incidentally or via the stomachs of birds that they have consumed. However, there is some evidence they at times will hunt large ground-dwelling insects such as dung beetles.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard,</b> also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard</b> (. Timon lepidus), which {{reaches its}} eastern range limit in Italy, is {{distributed}} along the coastal areas of Liguria. A field survey from 1999 to 2002, verified {{the status of}} the Italian populations. The observation of this species is very difficult in Liguria because of the scattered populations and their scarce density. Some new localities were discovered both in the Imperia and Savona provinces, and others were confirmed. An analysis of previous known records was also carried out. T. lepidus is distributed in this area from sea level to about 670 m a. s. l. in several primary or derived Mediterranean habitats such as maquis, pine open woodland and olive groves. The species has a wide phenology, and sightings have been recorded from January to November, though it is particularly active from April to September. The conservation status of the sites and their ecological suitability for the specie...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRefuges {{are crucial}} for most animal species as they offer {{essential}} protection against predators and provide buffered environmental conditions to their occupants. Our {{data show that}} northern populations of the threatened <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard</b> (Timon lepidus) depend {{on the availability of}} the burrows excavated by the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In the last decade, a severe decline in rabbit populations has had a disastrous effect on lizard numbers. To compensate for the lack of refuges, artificial shelters were constructed in autumn 2005 and 2007 and were monitored the following years (2006 – 2009). Most of the artificial refuges were rapidly occupied by lizards, notably juveniles, suggesting that this technique was successful to improve lizard habitat. Because other factors such as food resources might be also crucial, further assessments are required to determine if artificial refuges are sufficient to stem population decline. These results nonetheless provide an encouraging option to maintain and/or to restore threatened populations, for instance through a buffering of rabbit burrow fluctuations. More generally, the availability of suitable refuges (e. g. natural or artificial) {{is likely to be a}} central component for the conservation of many reptile species. The combination of empirical and experimental data further demonstrates that great attention must be paid to the structure and distribution of the refuges and that simple practical actions can effectively improve habitat quality for threatened species...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{behavioural}} thermoregulation and {{its consequences}} is a central topic in ecology. In this study, a spatial explicit model was developed to simulate the movement and thermal habitat use of lizards in a controlled environment. The model incorporates a lizard's transient body temperatures with a cellular automaton (CA) algorithm and links the physiology knowledge of the animal with the spatial utilization of its microhabitat. The model assumed that a lizard tries to maintain its preferred body temperature in a dynamic thermal environment by continuously selecting positions with different thermal conditions. The sequence of chosen positions formed a chain defining the individual's path, to be later aggregated into a map of thermal habitat use. An experiment was designed to test the model. An <b>ocellated</b> <b>lizard</b> (Timon lepidus) was kept in a terrarium with controlled dynamic thermal environment, and the thermal environment {{as well as the}} movement of the lizard were recorded by a variety of sensors. The model was tested to predict the spatial utilization of a lizard's thermal habitat in the terrarium based on three categories: high, moderate and low occupancy. The simulated results were compared with observations from the animal experiment. The predicted overall pattern of the micro-habitat occupancy of the lizard within 4 days matched the observation, at an overall accuracy of 75. 7 %. The results suggest that thermal habitat use by lizards in a controlled environment may be predicted by the integrated model of the lizard's body temperature and the CA algorithm...|$|E
