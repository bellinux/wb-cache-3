5|$|Various {{stories have}} been told about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E

5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Rudi Dornbusch (1998) and <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> income rises {{can change}} the ratio of demand for goods and {{services}} (tradable and non-tradable sectors).

25|$|Though {{the reason}} for {{establishing}} the small railroad is argued by historians, it is apparent to some {{that there was a}} need to provide some sort of public passenger service between the two communities. <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was the whimsy of two particular, wealthy Altadenans to provide themselves with the refined means of a daily train ride to get themselves from home to office and back home in a style grander than that of a horse and buggy.|$|E
25|$|Compared to east African {{countries}} like Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, {{the history of}} Islam in Rwanda is relatively modern. While a few written sources are available regarding its origins, it is claimed that Islam came through Arab merchants who first entered the country in 1901. <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Islam came when Europeans brought in Muslim clerks, administrative assistants, and merchants, from the Swahili-speaking coast of Tanzania. Islam was also bolstered by Muslim merchants from India, who married local Rwandans. Rwandans built their first mosque in 1913. This mosque {{is known as the}} al-Fatah mosque.|$|E
25|$|Scrying {{has been}} practised in many {{cultures}} {{in the belief that}} it can reveal the past, present, or future. Some practitioners assert that visions that come when one stares into the media are from the subconscious or imagination, while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they come from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice. There is neither any systematic body of empirical support for any such views in general however, nor for their respective rival merits; individual preferences in such matters are arbitrary at best.|$|E

25|$|For the {{cantilevered}} floors, Wright and {{his team}} used upside-down T-shaped beams integrated into a monolithic concrete slab which formed both {{the ceiling of the}} space below and provided resistance against compression. The contractor, Walter Hall, also an engineer, produced independent computations and argued for increasing the reinforcing steel in the first floor’s slab. Wright refused the suggestion. While some sources state that the contractor quietly doubled the amount of reinforcement, <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Kaufman's consulting engineers – at Kaufman's request – redrew Wright's reinforcing drawings and doubled the amount of steel specified by Wright.|$|E
25|$|Walter Whitehead {{was born}} on 12October 1840 at Haslam Hey, between Lowercroft and Walshaw in Bury, Lancashire. He was a son of John Whitehead and Eliza Ellen (née Allanson).

25|$|In the United States, legislators, {{health experts}} and {{consumer}} advocates are considering levying higher {{taxes on the}} sale of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption. <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> taxes should help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption. The food and beverage industry holds considerable clout in Washington, DC, as it has contributed more than $50 million to legislators since 2000.|$|E
