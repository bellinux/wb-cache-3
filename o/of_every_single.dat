5|$|Two {{years after}} his playing career ended with the Crusaders, Hammett was back with the Crusaders, working as a {{forwards}} coaching adviser for the 2006 Super 14 season. He went on to fulfill the same role for Canterbury in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup. He was later appointed as the new Crusaders assistant coach in November 2006 {{as a replacement for}} Vern Cotter who departed to France. Hammett remained as assistant coach from 2007 to 2010, and was not appointed as Crusaders' head coach when Robbie Deans left to coach Australia in 2008; Todd Blackadder was given the head coach role instead. During his time at the Crusaders, he helped guide the team to the semi-finals <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> season he was at the franchise, before securing their sixth and seventh title in 2006 and 2008. In later 2010, he was appointed coach of the Wellington-based Hurricanes ahead of the 2011 Super Rugby season. After the 2011 Super Rugby season – his first season in charge – Hammett decided controversially not to renew the contracts of All Blacks Ma'a Nonu and then Hurricanes' captain Andrew Hore. In the three years at the helm in Wellington, the Hurricanes failed to progress to the knock-out phase of the competition, only getting as high as seventh on the table; in 2014 Super Rugby season. In April 2014 Hammett indicated he would not be seeking to renew his contract when it expired {{at the end of the}} 2014 season.|$|E
25|$|Part II was {{originally}} supposed {{to concentrate on}} policy recommendations stemming from the analysis in Part I. However, the Sudanese government so strongly attacked {{the findings of the}} first part that the writers instead took the opportunity to back up the original publication. Part II thus consists of the listing <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> government official counted in the first part, with their regional and clan affiliation.|$|E

25|$|In early 1970 it {{was decided}} to change the planned name of the film and the {{associated}} album from Get Back to Let It Be, matching the group's March 1970 single release. The final version of the film was blown-up from full-frame 16mm to 35 mm film for theatrical release, which increased the film's graininess. To create the wider theatrical aspect ratio, {{the top and bottom of}} the frame was cropped, necessitating the repositioning <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> shot for optimal picture composition.|$|E
25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|Local {{community}} groups actively {{are working to}} gain individual and district landmark designations for the East Village to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. One such group is the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP). It has undertaken a complete survey of the East Village, documenting the history <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> building in the area. In the spring of 2011, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) proposed two East Village historic districts: one small district covering the block of East 10th Street known as Tompkins Square North, and one larger district focused around lower Second Avenue that would encompass 15 blocks and 330 buildings. The original proposal for the larger district excluded buildings such as the Pyramid Club and the Russian Orthodox Cathedral on East 2nd Street. As {{a result of the}} efforts made by local {{community groups}} such as GVSHP, the Lower East Side Preservation Initiative, East Village Community Coalition, and Historic Districts Council, however, the proposed district now includes these buildings.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E

Heyman stated that [...] "this [...] didn't happen because of me and it didn't happen because of Vince McMahon.

500|$|Following the privacy-based {{approach}} {{most commonly}} used post-Katz, the four-justice minority are instead {{of the opinion that}} the continuous monitoring <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> movement of an individual's car for 28 days violated a [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy", and thus constituted a search. Alito explained that before GPS and similar electronic technology, month-long surveillance of an individual's every move would have been exceptionally demanding and costly, requiring a tremendous amount of resources and people. [...] As a result, society's expectations were, and still are, that such complete and long-term surveillance would not be undertaken, and that an individual would not think it could occur to him or her.|$|E

500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E
500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaling {{cast her}} own mother and father, a doctor and an {{architect}} respectively, as the parents of her character. Kaling was proud of their acting, though she admitted that their presence on set was at first [...] "mortifying." [...] She commented, [...] "Of course I sort of lapsed back into that pre-teen attitude <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> thing my parents do embarrasses me. But they were great about it. They were such pros – they had all these scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it would be wonderful. But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E

500|$|Mackendrick {{assumed that}} Odets would need {{only two or}} three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The {{director}} recalled, [...] "We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern". The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success: [...] "What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy". This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, [...] "So we cut the script there on the floor, with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time".|$|E
500|$|In {{those cases}} {{they did not}} manage to conceal, however, the GDR's media was subject to {{stringent}} controls by the Stasi {{as well as the}} Socialist Unity Party of Germany, using Neues Deutschland, the GDR's second largest daily newspaper, as their zentralorgan. Through its own television station, the GDR government controlled the content shown in television broadcasting as well. The GDR border troops‘ actions were being portrayed as legitimate border defense and the people who were killed while trying to escape were defamed both in official statements as well as in reports of the state-controlled media. In 1962, East German journalist Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler commented on the death of Peter Fechter in the television program Der schwarze Kanal: [...] "The life <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one of our brave boys in uniform is worth more than the life of a lawbreaker to us. Staying away from the border, you can save yourself blood, tears and screams." [...] SED newspaper Neues Deutschland claimed Fechter was driven into suicide by [...] "front city bandits" [...] as well as accusing him of being homosexual. [...] In similar fashion, Günter Litfin was falsely depicted as being a homosexual, a prostitute as well as a criminal. In 1966, the Berliner Zeitung depicted Eduard Wroblewski as antisocial and being wanted as a Foreign Legionnaire for serious crimes in the district of Halle. These cases were exemplary of representatives of the press constructing false allegations in order to defame killed escapees.|$|E
500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through paperless ticket delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips. The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and {{do a better job of}} it?' It was important to us to address the issue of demand. We thought that <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> option that was available out there, this was a really viable option, to go with the paperless ticketing." [...] As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour, one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.|$|E

500|$|While on tour, {{the band}} started working out {{compositions}} between gigs {{for their next}} album, which would become Pawn Hearts (October 1971). The intention was to release a double album, and the band recorded the material; however, for economic reasons, the released recording was a single album containing three tracks – [...] "Lemmings", [...] "Man-Erg", and the 23 minute concept piece [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers". Reflecting on this, Hammill said: [...] "Charisma Records felt that it wasn't appropriate for us to release a double album and they vetoed the live studio recordings and the solo tracks by Guy, David, and Hugh." [...] The master tape of the recording sessions has been lost. Fripp again provided a cameo appearance on guitar. While [...] "Man-Erg" [...] had already been performed on stage, [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] evolved in the studio, recorded in small sections and pieced together during mixing. According to producer John Anthony, the track features a lot more studio experimentation than on previous albums, saying [...] "we pushed the facilities at Trident to the limit and had involved the use <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> tape machine in Trident at some stage." [...] The experiments included tape manipulation and Banton playing Mellotron and synthesizer. According to Jackson, one section of it features the entire band overdubbed 16 times. The album was not a success in the U.K, but proved highly successful in Italy, topping the chart there for 12 weeks. The following single, [...] "Theme One", reached number one in Italy, too. [...] "Theme One" [...] was an instrumental piece, originally written by Beatles producer George Martin as a fanfare for the BBC radio station Radio 1, later to appear on US pressings of Pawn Hearts.|$|E
