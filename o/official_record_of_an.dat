50|$|The Culper Ring {{provided}} {{valuable information}} to General Washington, {{including the fact}} that the British planned a surprise attack on the newly allied French forces under Lieutenant General Rochambeau at Newport, Rhode Island, before the French could fully recover and set up defenses after their arduous sea journey to America. They also reported that the British planned to counterfeit American currency on the actual paper used for the Continental dollars, prompting the Continental Congress to retire the bills. The ring learned that Major General William Tryon's raid in Connecticut in July 1779 was a diversion to induce Washington to divide his forces, so that Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton could attack them piecemeal. And they discovered that a high-ranking American officer (subsequently shown to be Benedict Arnold) had been plotting with British Major John Andre to surrender the garrison to the British and to turn over the vitally important American fort at West Point, New York on the Hudson River. The Culper Ring is often credited with the exposure of an attempt on Washington's life, but no <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attempt exists, and therefore it is conjecture.|$|E
40|$|This project {{follows the}} treaty-based legal efforts of sisters Mary and Carrie Dann in their fight to assert Western Shoshone land rights against the US government. Beginning with a 1952 claims {{case before the}} Indian Claims Commission, the US attempt to make restitutions for the {{wrongful}} taking of Western Shoshone lands itself threatened persistent Shoshone treaty rights. The Dann sisters, along with other, self-described Western Shoshone “traditionals”, undertook to reverse the federal liquidation of Shoshone treaty rights, engaging federal claims commissioners, attorneys, and courts along the way. Their legal activism relied heavily on the assertion of sovereign rights under the Western Shoshone’s 1863 treaty of peace and friendship with the United States. The Danns’ eventual representation before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights resulted in an important international censure against the United States’ indigenous policies. While the US government fervently prosecuted a claims award distribution that would liquidate Shoshone title to treaty lands, the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alternative vision of Shoshone-US relations and {{the significance of the}} Treaty of Ruby Valley which the Danns helped to inscribe {{is a testament to the}} power of treaty-based Native activism in challenging federal authority in Indian affairs...|$|E
40|$|The “paperless office” {{concept has}} been around for decades, and many have cited that the {{electronic}} office has instead increased the amount of paper produced. Case studies have shown that a successful “paperless” system requires motivation, ease of use, and cost savings [5]. Paper will co-exist with electronic records for the foreseeable future; however, what happens when the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> institution becomes “paperless”? This short paper presents a case study describing the efforts in the University of Oregon Office of the President to move to a fully electronic records system, the trickle-down effect to campus units, and the work of the Libraries to preserve the institutional record. The Libraries created a model to solve the immediate needs of the Office of the President addressing issues of workflow and preservation before an ideal system and staffing could be realized. A hands-on approach was employed, focusing on day-to-day work and ease of use for office contacts, and standards and migration plans for archival files using PLATTER [1]. By doing this, a foundation was created for an electronic records system that can be adapted across campus for administrative offices, faculty scholarship, cultural museums, science labs, and student coursework...|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, Puerto Rico is also {{unique in}} that it is the only U.S. {{jurisdiction}} in which the everyday working language of court proceedings, statutes, regulations, and case law is Spanish.

Some states, such as California, do provide certain court forms in other languages (Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Vietnamese) for the convenience of immigrants and naturalized citizens. But American law as developed through statutes, regulations, and case law is always in English, attorneys are expected to take and pass the bar examination in English, judges hear oral argument, supervise trials, and issue orders from the bench in English, and testimony and documents originating in other languages is translated into English before being incorporated into the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case.|$|R
50|$|The Louisbourg in {{the colony}} of Île-Royale (Cape Breton & Prince Edward Island) is one city of New France with <b>official</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black slave community.

It was the midpoint between Europe and France’s Caribbean colonies, and was not so subject to sea ice as the settlements to the west. Its economy depended on fishing, the military and trade. It is believed that hundreds of black slaves traveled through the port aboard merchant vessels; only 216 black individuals, nevertheless, were actually enslaved on Ile Royale. The majority of these slaves were {{the property of the}} wealthiest individuals of Ile Royale: merchants, government and military officials.

Often it was another convict; sometimes it was the culprit's dearest comrade; and he had to lay on with all his might; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for his mercy --for he was under watch--and yet not do his friend any good: the friend would be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the matter of full punishment.|$|R
