The power supply ripple was identified as the main fluctuations source and (2) large-scale plasma fluctuations inside the nozzle could cause transient (total duration of the order of 100 μs) Townsend avalanches developing in the space-charge layer located between the arc plasma and the nozzle wall.

40|$|At present, {{highly alloyed steels}} in the {{thickness}} range above 8 mm can be cut by laser radiation to only a limited extent: The high portion of alloying constituents is indeed reducing the thermal conductivity and thus the thermal losses during the cutting process. But on the other hand, especially with the most established laser cutting technique - laser <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> - the alloying elements are leading to detrimental effects even in the lower thickness range (1 - 4). Chromium oxides with a high melting point do not dissolve in the metallic melt. This condition causes a limitation of the exothermic reaction in {{the upper part of}} the cutting front. At the same time, the high viscosity of the oxide layer complicates the melt ejection. Thus, in the lower region of the cutting front, the oxide film is bursted by stagnating melt volume and subsequently an uncontrollable exothermic superreaction occurs.

Based on the finding that diffusion was inhibited by a small increase in the floodwater table, we conclude that internal oxygen transport during a rising water table is only attainable when adventitious roots are continuously and rapidly developed, as is the case in S. martiana.

The temperature and density radial profiles of the arc plasma were found in each case by an inversion procedure of these signals. A comparison between the obtained results shows that the shorter nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, L N = 4. 5 mm operated at 0. 7 MPa and 35 Nl/min) produces a thinner and hotter arc than the larger nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, LN = 9. 0 mm operated at 1. 1 MPa and 20 Nl/min).
