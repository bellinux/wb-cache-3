40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Only a small {{percentage}} of stroke patients are treated with thrombolytic therapy. We sought to determine whether vessel occlusion in mild strokes represented a new target population for interventional therapy. METHODS: We imaged 106 acute stroke patients with MRI. Patients were identified with evidence of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and mild or <b>no</b> <b>stroke</b> signs (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] 3, and MCA occlusion. RESULTS: We identified 5 patients with absent flow on MRA in the MCA and mild or <b>no</b> <b>stroke</b> signs (NIHSS <or= 3). All 5 were functionally independent at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised in considering thrombolytic therapy in these patients. Quantification of perfusion imaging is required to identify "at risk" mild stroke populations...|$|R

This study used rowers’ performance-based judgments to compare three measures of catch slip efficiency. Two questions were addressed: (1) would rower-judged Yes strokes be faster than <b>No</b> <b>strokes?</b> and (2) which method of quantifying catch slip best reflected these judgements? Methods: Eight single scullers performed two 10 -min blocks of sub maximal on-water rowing at 20 strokes per minute. Every 30 s, rowers reported either Yes or No {{about the quality of}} their stroke at the catch. Results: It was found that Yes strokes identified by rowers had, on average, a moderate effect advantage over <b>No</b> <b>strokes</b> with a standardised effect size of 0. 43. In addition, a quicker time to positive acceleration best reflected the change in performance; where the standardised mean difference score of 0. 57 for time to positive acceleration was larger than the scores of 0. 47 for time to PowerLine force, and 0. 35 for time to 30 % peak pin force catch slip measures. For all eight rowers, Yes strokes corresponded to time to positive acceleration occurring earlier than <b>No</b> <b>strokes.</b> Conclusion: Rower judgements about successful strokes was linked to achieving a quicker time to positive acceleration, and may be of the most value in achieving a higher average boat velocity...|$|R
