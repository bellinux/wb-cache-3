5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{publicize}} the N-3PB operations, the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian-flown aircraft {{had been involved in}} the attack on the German battleship Bismarck on 21–22 May 1941, but it was merely an example <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> propaganda. Despite many aviation historians disputing the claim, it still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck.|$|E

5|$|The project {{expenditure}} through 1 October 1945 was $1.845billion, {{equivalent to}} less than nine days <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> spending, and was $2.191billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} complex were used by the Nazi Germany for detention, interrogation, and execution. About 50,000 people were executed there, including more than 30,000 victims of the Holocaust. Some sections have since been restored; the Ninth Fort houses a museum and memorial devoted to the victims <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> mass executions. The complex is the most complete remaining example of a Russian Empire fortress.|$|E
5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, a {{propaganda}} film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Kraft {{began his}} studies at Virginia Tech {{and became a}} member of the Corps of Cadets. During his {{freshman}} year, he attempted to enlist in the military as a U.S. Navy cadet but was rejected because of a burned right hand that he had suffered at age three. Because <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> demands, Virginia Tech was operating on a twelve-month schedule, and Kraft finished his degree in only two years. He graduated in December 1944 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.|$|E

In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Molotov {{accompanied}} Stalin to the Teheran Conference in 1943, the Yalta Conference in 1945 and, {{following the}} defeat of Germany, the Potsdam Conference.

Molotov lost his position of First Deputy Chairman on March 19, 1946, after the Council of People's Commissars was reformed as the Council of Ministers.|$|E

5|$|Within MIT's new Laboratory for Nuclear Science, {{headed by}} Zacharias, Rossi was {{assigned}} to create a cosmic ray research group. He recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos, including Sands, and two {{who had been in}} the Radiation Laboratory, as Ph.D. candidates. All were more mature than typical graduate students, with several years <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> research experience. They were paid a stipend similar to that of a postdoctoral researcher, which enabled them to support families during their graduate studies. The laboratory was funded by the Office of Naval Research.|$|E
5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{was built}} by Prince Rupert Drydock & Shipyard, Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada as yard number 43.

Ownership was retained by WSA with the Ministry of War Transport placing her under {{the management of the}} Port Line. The United Kingdom Official Number 168351 and Code Letters BKLG were allocated.

5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian {{settlers}} set up {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>wartime</b> funds, including funds to aid war victims, funds to provide the troops with tobacco and other supplies, funds to assist orphans and widows, funds to buy aeroplanes, and others. These raised about £200,000 in all. Much of this went to the Prince of Wales National Relief Fund in Britain, which was founded when the war started; Southern Rhodesian branches of the fund were promptly organised in several towns and ultimately consolidated into the Rhodesian War Relief Fund. This body donated 25% of its receipts to the Prince of Wales Fund and 75% to local concerns.|$|E
