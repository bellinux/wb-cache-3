40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{analysis of the}} effect of condenser subcooling on the performance of vapor-compression systems. It is shown that, as condenser subcooling increases, the COP reaches a maximum {{as a result of a}} trade-off between increasing <b>refrigerating</b> <b>effect</b> and specific compression work. The thermodynamic properties associated with the relative increase in <b>refrigerating</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e. liquid specific heat and latent heat of vaporization, are dominant to determine the maximum COP improvement with condenser subcooling. Refrigerants with large latent heat of vaporization tend to benefit less from condenser subcooling. For a typical AC system, numerical results indicate that the R 1234 yf would benefit the most from condenser subcooling in comparison to R 410 A, R 134 a and R 717 due to its smaller latent heat of vaporization. On the other hand, the value of COP maximizing subcooling does not seem to be a strong function of thermodynamic properties. Experimental results comparing R 1234 yf and R 134 a confirmed the trends observed during the numerical study.
