5|$|Riya has {{suffered}} a number of untimely incidents. During the filming of Shaadi No. 1 in France, she was knocked unconscious after being accidentally {{run over by a}} stuntman's motorbike, but she was not seriously injured. Shortly before the release of Silsiilay, in which she starred <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend Ashmit Patel, a 90-second video clip was circulated on Multimedia Messaging Services and the internet, showing the pair in compromising situations in a hotel bedroom. This was {{one of a number of}} controversies that erupted when celebrities were caught in similar situations using cameraphones. Following this incident, the couple split up, although Riya denied that she was the girl in the MMS clip. One commentator claimed that the footage was an orchestrated publicity stunt. In 2007, she underwent a brief detoxification period in Bangkok for addiction to chocolate.|$|E

25|$|During {{the run of}} the exhibition, Abramović {{performed}} The Artist Is Present, a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, {{in which}} she sat immobile in the museum's atrium while spectators were invited to take turns sitting <b>opposite</b> <b>her.</b> Ulay made a surprise appearance at the opening night of the show.|$|E

25|$|She played <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> husband, William Moore (1916–2000), {{in several}} series, {{including}} two episodes of The Liver Birds {{and again in}} My Husband and I, on both occasions as a married couple.

25|$|From 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the Music Director of the New York City Symphony, {{which had}} been founded the {{previous}} year by the conductor Leopold Stokowski. The orchestra (with support from the Mayor) was aimed at a different audience than the New York Philharmonic, with more modern programs and cheaper tickets. Also in regard to a different audience, in 1945 Bernstein discussed the possibility of acting in a film with Greta Garbo—playing Tchaikovsky <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> starring role as the composer's patron Nadezhda von Meck.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Allyson {{had been}} signed to appear <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> {{childhood}} idol Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding, {{but had to}} leave the production because of pregnancy. (She was replaced initially by Judy Garland, and later by Jane Powell.) In 1956 she starred with a young rising star named Jack Lemmon in the musical comedy, You Can't Run Away From It. Besides Van Johnson, James Stewart was a frequent co-star, teaming up with Allyson in three popular biographies, The Glenn Miller Story, The Stratton Story, and Strategic Air Command.|$|E

25|$|Kurt Weill was {{commissioned}} to compose Die sieben Todsünden by Edward James, a wealthy Englishman {{who had been}} in Paris during Weill's visit in December 1932. James's wife, Tilly Losch, was a ballerina who James described as having a striking resemblance to Weill's wife, Lotte Lenya. Because James knew that Weill was going to write for Lenya, he included language in the contract commissioning the work requiring that his wife, Losch, dance <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> lookalike. This dictated the complicated split personality plot before Bertolt Brecht was even asked to write the libretto.|$|E
25|$|She {{starred in}} at least two silent films, both <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> then husband Harry Spingler. Michelena played Helen Warner in Driftwood, a family drama {{produced}} in March 1916 by the Ocean Film Corporation. The film was adapted from the 1911 Owen Davis play by Anthony Paul Kelly and directed by Marshall Farnum, brother of Dustin Farnum. Michelena next appeared in The Devil's Playground, a social drama produced by Monmouth Films in 1917. The Devil's Playground was directed by Harry McRae Webster, who also shared the writing credits with Dallas Tyler.|$|E
25|$|With that film, Dressler {{demonstrated}} her profound generosity {{to other}} performers: Dressler personally insisted that her studio bosses cast Cromwell on a loan-out {{in the lead}} <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> — it was another break that helped sustain his rising status in Hollywood. Emma also starred Myrna Loy {{in one of her}} earlier screen performances. After production on Emma was completed, Director Clarence Brown tested Cromwell for the male lead in his next feature: The Son-Daughter, which was set to star Helen Hayes. However, the part of the oriental prince ultimately went to Ramón Novarro, and Cromwell never again worked at MGM.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the judges}} of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her {{alongside}} his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but {{she felt she was}} too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined.|$|E
25|$|In {{her early}} {{days as a}} leading lady she was {{particularly}} associated with the plays of Arthur Wing Pinero and later had parts written for her by J. M. Barrie, Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, A. A. Milne and Noël Coward. More famous for comic rather than dramatic roles, Vanbrugh nevertheless played {{a number of the}} latter in both modern works and the classics. Her stage debut was in Shakespeare, but she seldom acted in his works later in her career; exceptions were her Queen Gertrude in Hamlet in 1931 and her Meg Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor, <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> sister Violet as Alice Ford, in 1937.|$|E
25|$|According to Brackett, he and Wilder never {{considered}} anyone except Gloria Swanson {{for the role}} of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads, but never approached either with an offer. He contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also asked Norma Shearer if she would portray Norma Desmond, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for it. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> as Joe. The filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, but she expressed no interest. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.|$|E

25|$|Richardson {{began her}} career in {{regional}} theatre at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, and, in 1984, at the Open Air Theatre in London's Regent's Park, when she appeared in A Midsummer Night's Dream with Ralph Fiennes and Richard E. Grant. Her first professional work in London's West End was in a revival of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull in 1985. Soon after, she starred in a London stage production of High Society, adapted from the Cole Porter film. In 1993 she made her Broadway debut {{in the title role}} of Anna Christie, which is where she met future husband, Liam Neeson. In 1998, she played the role of Sally Bowles in Sam Mendes' revival of Cabaret on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The following year she returned to Broadway in Closer, for which she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play, and in 2005, she appeared again with the Roundabout, this time as Blanche DuBois in their revival of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, opposite John C. Reilly as Stanley Kowalski. In January 2009, two months before her death, Richardson played the role of Desirée in a concert production of Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music, <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> mother, Vanessa Redgrave who played Mme. Armfeldt. At the time of Richardson's death, the pair were preparing to co-star in a Broadway revivial of the musical.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair <b>opposite</b> <b>her.</b> Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E
500|$|The {{portrait}} {{was commissioned}} by the art loving Tommaso as the right-hand wing of a triptych. She was placed <b>opposite</b> <b>her</b> husband, with a now lost central Madonna and Child. [...] Their small size and intimacy suggests that the portraits were commissioned for private prayer, some art historians believe given that Tommaso's cultural acumen and preoccupation with his social standing, they were partially accessible to the public. The triptych may have been intended for the Portinari Chapel, located behind the apse of the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, Milan, and constructed between 1462 and 1468.|$|E
