A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the <b>oxidative</b> <b>burst</b> where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the <b>oxidative</b> <b>burst</b> with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E

In addition, they are naturally resistant {{to a number of}} antibiotics that disrupt cell-wall biosynthesis, such as penicillin. Due to their unique cell wall, they can survive long exposure to acids, alkalis, detergents, <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts,</b> lysis by complement, and many antibiotics. Most mycobacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifamycin, but antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged.|$|R

However, dietary relevant exposure would not be likely to alter immune response.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an <b>oxidative</b> <b>burst</b> to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.|$|E

[...] A. thaliana {{has been instrumental}} in dissecting these pathways to better understand the regulation of immune responses, the most notable one being the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascade. [...] Downstream responses of PTI include callose deposition, the <b>oxidative</b> <b>burst,</b> and transcription of defense-related genes.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Leishmania protozoan is its glycoconjugate layer of lipophosphoglycan (LPG). This is held together with a phosphoinositide membrane anchor, and has a tripartite structure consisting of a lipid domain, a neutral hexasaccharide, and a phosphorylated galactose-mannose, with a termination in a neutral cap. Not only do these parasites develop postphlebotomus digestion, but it is also thought to be essential to <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts,</b> thus allowing passage for infection. Characteristics of intracellular digestion include an endosome fusing with a lysosome, releasing acid hydrolases which degrade DNA, RNA, proteins and carbohydrates.|$|R

This is particularly relevant for pathogens that utilize different hosts to complete their life cycle. In addition to homeotic environmental challenges, other stressful factors, such as <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts,</b> are often triggered in response to infection. It is not surprising that many successful pathogens have developed robust chaperone systems to conquer the stressful environments in the host. In addition to discussing ingenious ways by which pathogens have utilized chaperones, the potential of exploiting pathogen chaperones as drug targets is also discussed...|$|R

The strengths and weaknesses of the wall "loosening enzyme" concept are reviewed and the possibility of expansin involvement in the bending response of stems is considered. Also discussed is the possibility that wall stiffening processes, e. g. phenolic coupling driven by <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts</b> or altered orientation of newly deposited cellulose, might mediate the growth responses during gravitropism...|$|R
2500|$|Competence in S. pneumoniae is {{induced by}} DNA-damaging agents such as {{mitomycin}} C, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. Transformation protects S. pneumoniae against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C. [...] Michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in S. pneumoniae {{is associated with}} increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the RecA protein, {{a key component of}} the recombinational repair machinery for removing DNA damages. On the basis of these findings they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damages. S. pneumoniae infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an <b>oxidative</b> <b>burst</b> that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of S. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative DNA damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogen’s virulence. Consistent with this premise Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable S. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of some fluoroquinolones are still capable of affecting the topological characteristics of DNA (inhibition DNA-gyrase) and that this leads to a reduction in some of the factors responsible for bacterial virulence (by means of the disruption of protein synthesis and alterations in phenotype expression), even though the microorganisms themselves are not killed. The present study investigated the ability of sub-MICs of rufloxacin, an orally absorbed monofluorinated quinolone with a long half-life (28 to 30 h), to interfere with the bacterial virulence parameters of adhesiveness, hemagglutination, hydrophobicity, motility, and filamentation, as well as their interactions with host neutrophilic defenses such as phagocytosis, killing, and <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts.</b> It was observed that Escherichia coli adhesiveness was significantly reduced at rufloxacin concentrations of 1 / 32 MIC, hemagglutination and hydrophobicity were significantly reduced at concentrations of, respectively, 1 / 4 MIC and 1 / 8 MIC, and motility was significantly reduced at concentrations of 1 / 16 MIC; filamentation was still present at concentrations of 1 / 4 MIC. Phagocytosis was not affected, but killing significantly increased from 1 / 2 MIC to 1 / 8 MIC; <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts</b> measured by means of chemiluminescence were not affected. The fact that sub-MICs are still effective in interfering with the parameters of bacterial virulence is useful information that needs to be correlated with pharmacokinetic data in order to extend our knowledge of the most effective concentrations {{that can be used to}} optimize treatment schedules, for example, single administrations, particularly in noncomplicated lower urinary tract infections...|$|R

A multitude of threats to stable and secure yields of these crops exist including from losses caused by pathogens, particularly fungal. Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to resist pathogens including programmed cell death responses, the release of pathogenicity-related proteins and <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts.</b> Another such mechanism is the synthesis and release of secondary metabolites toxic to potential pathogens. Several classes of these compounds have been identified and their anti-fungal properties demonstrated. However the lack of suitable analytical techniques has hampered the progress of identifying and exploiting more of these novel metabolites.

Atypically, the mutant has decreased resistance to menadione but an increased H 2 O 2 resistance phenotype. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soilborne gram-negative pathogenic bacterium causing crown gall tumors in many di-cotyledonous plants (29).

40|$|Oxygen {{metabolism}} has {{an important}} role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the course of cellular oxidative phosphorylation, and by activated phagocytic cells during <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts,</b> exceed the physiological buffering capacity and result in oxidative stress. The excessive production of ROS can damage protein, lipids, nucleic acids, and matrix components. They also serve as important intracellular signaling molecules that amplify the synovial inflammatory–proliferative response. Repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation associated with changes in synovial perfusion are postulated to activate hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α and nuclear factor-κB, two key transcription factors that are regulated by changes in cellular oxygenation and cytokine stimulation, and that in turn orchestrate the expression of a spectrum of genes critical to the persistence of synovitis. An understanding of the complex interactions involved in these pathways might allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen and}} {{nitrogen}} species function in host defense via mechanisms that remain controversial. Pathogens might encounter {{varying levels of}} these species, but bulk measurements cannot resolve such heterogeneity. We used single-cell approaches to determine the impact of oxidative and nitrosative stresses on individual Salmonella during early infection in mouse spleen. Salmonella encounter and respond to both stresses, but the levels and impact vary widely. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes kill Salmonella by generating overwhelming oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. This controls Salmonella within inflammatory lesions but does not prevent their spread to more permissive resident red pulp macrophages, which generate only sublethal <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts.</b> Regional host expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase exposes some Salmonella to nitrosative stress, triggering effective local Salmonella detoxification through nitric oxide denitrosylase. Thus, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species influence dramatically different outcomes of disparate Salmonella-host cell encounters, which together determine overall disease progression...|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{implantation}} or {{injection of}} a biomaterial-based construct injures the tissue, {{resulting in an}} influx of blood and cell death. Dying cells release danger signals (danger associated molecular patterns, DAMPs) that induce local inflammation [66] and activate resident macrophages [67],[68]. These DAMPs include HMGB 1, histones, and uric acid [66],[67],[69],[70]. Blood proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and various complement proteins adsorb {{to the surface of}} the biomaterial [71]. Activation of the complement cascade results in opsonization of the biomaterial surface with C 3 b and induces inflammation through the anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a [72]. These anaphylatoxins recruit leukocytes to the site of inflammation, cause histamine release from mast cells, and induce <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts</b> in neutrophils [73]. Release of histamine from mast cells attracts neutrophils and monocytes [74],[75]. Neutrophils are the first immune cells to arrive at the implant site [76] and, along with mast cells, secrete IL- 4 and IL- 13 early in innate immune responses [9].|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Studying primary adult {{microglia}} is hampered {{because of}} the difficult isolation procedure and the low cell yield. We therefore established a differentiation protocol using a culture system developed {{for the expansion of}} non-adherent bone marrow cells. Methods: Non-adherent bone marrow derived stem cells (NA-BMC) are derived by selective adhesion ('preplating') and are non adhesive adult stem cells. We investigated the changes in bone marrow cell populations by this repeated selective adhesion and compared the potential of the derived cells to differentiate towards microglia. Cells were differentiated with astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Results: NA-BMC cultures show a steep raise in the fraction of stem cells during the cultivation time and the differentiation potential is of the same quality as established protocols. Around 70 % of the cells are microglia defined as being positive for CD 11 b/CD 45 and show phagocytosis activity and <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts.</b> Conclusion: The non-adherent cell system has the advantage that is produces stem cell progenitors during expansion and provides good microglial differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blastocystis is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} anaerobic eukaryotic parasite of humans and animals {{that is associated with}} various gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disorders. Epidemiological studies have identified different subtypes but no one subtype has been definitively correlated with disease. Results: Here we report the 18. 8 Mb genome sequence of a Blastocystis subtype 7 isolate, which is the smallest stramenopile genome sequenced to date. The genome is highly compact and contains intriguing rearrangements. Comparisons with other available stramenopile genomes (plant pathogenic oomycete and diatom genomes) revealed effector proteins potentially involved in the adaptation to the intestinal environment, which were likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, Blastocystis living in anaerobic conditions harbors mitochondria-like organelles. An incomplete oxidative phosphorylation chain, a partial Krebs cycle, amino acid and fatty acid metabolisms and an iron-sulfur cluster assembly are all predicted to occur in these organelles. Predicted secretory proteins possess putative activities that may alter host physiology, such as proteases, protease-inhibitors, immunophilins and glycosyltransferases. This parasite also possesses the enzymatic machinery to tolerate <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts</b> resulting from its own metabolism or induced by the host immune system. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the genome architecture of this unusual stramenopile. It als...|$|R
40|$|Unprecedented biotechnological {{advances}} {{in the past decade}} have delivered powerful transcriptomics methods that provide new opportunities for a risk-based and, hence, more effective control of food quality and safety. The fundamental hypothesis underlying the application of a transcriptomics or other “-omics” strategies is that toxicant-specific changes of gene expression will reveal the presence of chemical hazards with possibly adverse health effects. Indeed, living cells display wide adaptive plasticity by responding with characteristic expression signatures to various stimuli (e. g., proliferation signals, genotoxic or cytotoxic insults, <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts</b> and other types of chemical stress). Flexible transcriptomics platforms that can be scaled to suit different applications in food quality and safety involve oligonucleotide microarrays (also known as “DNA chips”), focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and, more recently, high-throughput “next generation” sequencing technologies. In this review, we illustrate the potential impact of transcriptomics for the detection of hazardous food constituents or contaminants, including dioxins, xenoestrogens, mycotoxins and Maillard reaction products. We also discuss the predictive power of “-omics” fingerprinting with respect to the identification of emerging contaminants and the significance of these methods for risk assessment at all stages of the food-production chain...|$|R

40|$|Host {{control of}} infections crucially {{depends on the}} {{capability}} to kill pathogens with reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, these toxic molecules can also readily damage host components and cause severe immunopathology. Here, we show that neutrophils use their most abundant granule protein, myeloperoxidase, to target ROS specifically to pathogens while minimizing collateral tissue damage. A computational model predicted that myeloperoxidase efficiently scavenges diffusible H 2 O 2 at the surface of phagosomal Salmonella and converts it into highly reactive HOCl (bleach), which rapidly damages biomolecules within a radius of less than 0. 1  μm. Myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils were predicted to accumulate large quantities of H 2 O 2 that still effectively kill Salmonella, but most H 2 O 2 would leak from the phagosome. Salmonella stimulation of neutrophils from normal and myeloperoxidase-deficient human donors experimentally confirmed an inverse relationship between myeloperoxidase activity and extracellular H 2 O 2 release. Myeloperoxidase-deficient mice infected with Salmonella had elevated hydrogen peroxide tissue levels and exacerbated oxidative damage of host lipids and DNA, despite almost normal Salmonella control. These data show that myeloperoxidase has a major function in mitigating collateral tissue damage during antimicrobial <b>oxidative</b> <b>bursts,</b> by converting diffusible long-lived H 2 O 2 into highly reactive, microbicidal and locally confined HOCl at pathogen surfaces...|$|R
