5|$|Because Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Running back David Wilson returned the opening kickoff to the Tech 21-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began the first drive of the second half. The first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to Coale, beginning a seven-play, 67-yard drive resulting in a touchdown. The culminating play of the drive was a 45-yard pass from Taylor to Coale for the touchdown, which extended Tech's lead to 11 points, 28–17, at the 11:24 mark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, a team {{turnover}} {{and a series}} of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50–27 at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b> The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter,</b> by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.|$|E
5|$|NC State {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff {{and returned}} the ball to their 32-yard line. The Wolfpack offense had time for just one play—an eight-yard pass—before the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b> With one quarter remaining in the game, NC State still held a 2116 lead.|$|E

On the final play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter,</b> Turner handed the ball off to sophomore running back Morgan Green, who picked up three yards. The quarter ended with Nevada leading, 14–13.|$|E
5|$|After a short gain {{on first}} down, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play {{resulted in a}} first down at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt a conversion prior to the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter,</b> the Hokies let the clock roll down with the Longhorns in the lead, 70.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> at their 39-yard line {{and started the}} drive with five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying {{the ball into the}} end zone. The score capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive that grew the Hokies' advantage to 18 points, 35–17.|$|E

5|$|As {{it had in}} {{the third}} quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In only three plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard throw to Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b> The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had the ball at its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten. On the first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter,</b> Tennessee ran an end-around to Kendrick Jones, who ran the ball for 76 yards, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Virginia Tech five-yard line. Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the goal line for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback Taylor was sacked {{on the first}} play of the drive, the Hokies recovered the lost yardage and gained a first down with the final play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b> With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> was a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel for a first down. That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Noel ran for a first down at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards, setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play, and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line. Tech {{committed}} a five-yard penalty, {{and as the}} final seconds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> ticked off, Florida State ran up the middle for five yards and a first down. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the score was 147, Florida State leading.|$|E
