5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard.

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|A railway, the Bristol Port Railway, {{was built}} through the gorge {{on the east}} side from Hotwells to Avonmouth between 1863 and 1865. The Portishead Railway was opened on the west side in 1867. The section of the Bristol Port Railway between Hotwells and Sneyd Park {{junction}} was closed in 1922, when construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> road through the gorge, the Portway, was started. The Portway was opened in 1926. The road is now part of the A4 road, linking Bristol city centre to the M5 motorway, which bypasses the city near Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> penalty).|$|E

The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States {{because he had a}} criminal record in his home country.|$|E
