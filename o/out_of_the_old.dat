5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to {{the removal of the}} tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E

5|$|On termination, the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E
