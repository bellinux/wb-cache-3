5|$|An {{earthquake}} <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave {{near the}} village of Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E

25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF, mucoviscidosis) is {{a genetic}} disease with increased viscosity of various secretions leading to organ failure of lung, pancreas and other organs. It is caused {{in nearly all}} cases by a deletion of phenylalanine 508 of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This mutation causes a maturation defect of this ion channel protein with increased degradation, mediated by HSPs. Deletion of the co-chaperone AHA1 (activator of heat shock 90kDa protein ATPase homolog 1) leads to stabilization of CFTR and <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> perspective for a new therapy.|$|E

He assures her that he would not put someone in Level 5 who didn't belong there, and Claire tells him about Canfield's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E
25|$|The family {{moves to}} Chatham, after Ben is ordered {{back with his}} detachment. Arabella <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting {{the help of her}} mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.|$|E

25|$|Development {{arrives in}} Ilmorog as the {{government}} begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it {{to ensure that they}} own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.|$|E

[...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work.

500|$|Matt Brassil of Heave Media ranked [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as the seventh-best {{television}} {{episode of}} 2013, {{stating that the}} episode's handling of Louise's crush [...] "cracks through that little girl surface into the inevitable woman [...] will become, and the writing starts to show how even the most maniacal girl with a bunny hat can be humanized." [...] Phillip Maciak, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, named Kristen Schaal's voice acting as Louise on Bob's Burgers as his favorite television performance {{of the year and}} cited her performance in the episode: [...] "Schaal's handling of the anger and betrayal Louise feels as she finds herself attracting to a boy for the first time is actually quite moving. But, more than that, it <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> new register of this top-register performance as Louise’s murderous rage turns to murderous romance." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Dan Crane of The New York Times, [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] was {{the music}} video that {{garnered}} {{the most attention}} following the release of Beyoncé. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani commented that the song sounded more [...] "immersive" [...] accompanied by its music video. Similarly, NMEs Emily Mackay who gave a mixed review for the song, felt that its visual [...] " [...] the day", and deemed the scene where Beyoncé wrecks her trophy shelf as [...] "powerful". Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the video [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "touching," [...] wrote that the [...] "shots of her bashing her trophy shelf prove way more cathartic than any pageant victory". Kitty Empire of The Observer commented that the video contained perspective in the scenes depicting [...] "painful depilating, pill-popping and toilet-hugging details". Vanity writer Michelle Collins felt that the singer managed to make exercising look difficult and uncomfortable, and praised the scene where Beyoncé responds to the pageant judge questioning her life aspirations. Spins Philip Sherburne alluded that the video was emotional and wrote that it offered [...] "a story line that <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> wealth of readings about race, skin tone, beauty standards, and her [...] own mutable image." [...] Whitney Phaneuf from the website HitFix praised Beyoncé's acting in the video and added that the vulnerability in the character she portrayed was [...] "palpable". Phaneuf went on to opine that the footage of Beyoncé competing in a talent show as a child made the clip look more realistic. Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! wrote that the video allowed Beyoncé to showcase her acting abilities. The editors of Out magazine likened the clip to the films Magic Mike (2012) and American Hustle (2013).|$|E
