5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>student</b> and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E

25|$|The second {{purpose of}} the 8LMQs is to {{transition}} ‘teaching’ from ‘teacher centred activities’ to a more responsive ‘student-centred learning' approaches.

25|$|Washington University {{has over}} 300 {{undergraduate}} student organizations on campus. Most are {{funded by the}} Washington University Student Union, which has a $2 million plus annual budget that is completely student-controlled {{and is one of}} the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, the Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD (a semesterly concert in the quad) and free copies of the New York Times, USA Today, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch through The Collegiate Readership Program; it also contributes to the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series produced by the University, and funds the campus television station, WUTV, and the radio station, KWUR. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus. There are 11 fraternities and 9 sororities, with approximately 35% of the student body being involved in Greek life. The Congress of the South 40 (CS40) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board, which operates outside of the SU sphere. CS40's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>student</b> living on the South 40.|$|E

2500|$|The HKSAR Government Scholarship is {{a prestigious}} award {{associated}} with the HKCEE Examination. The top 30–40 candidates in the HKCEE Examination receive this scholarship each year. Counterintuitively, many 10A students fail to receive this award. This apparent paradox is mainly due to the methodology in which the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded. Rather than calculating the number of A's each student has, the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded {{on the basis of}} the highest total in raw scores attained in the seven best subjects <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>student.</b> Consequently, many 9A, 8A, and even 7A students go on to win this award while 10A students go home empty handed. This has been a major source of complaint [...] from eager parents of 10A students who felt cheated from this coveted prize.|$|E

2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>student.</b> The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E
