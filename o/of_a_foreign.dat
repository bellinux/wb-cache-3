5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Jacob {{attends a}} lecture given by Gekko and {{introduces}} himself. Gekko {{tells him that}} KZI's collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having toxic debt.

In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative.

That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, {{the first time that}} a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
