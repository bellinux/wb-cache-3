40|$|The {{traveling}} screen; a rotating, belt type, mechanical {{screen was}} built to remove the invasive Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF). Because the screen has been demonstrated to be fish friendly during mitten crab removal (1996 - 1999), it was natural to test the traveling screen as a general <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> <b>device.</b> The goals {{of this study were}} to determine of the screen could be used to remove debris flowing through the primary fish guidance louvers to the secondary fish guidance louvers, and also to determine if improvements to the <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> system could be made to improve collection and transport of collected debris to the debris hauling truck. Three different evaluation techniques were used to determine the effectiveness of the traveling screen to remove debris: (1) The addition of known amounts of debris, introduced upstream of the traveling screen, compared to the debris recovered by the traveling screen. (2) Overnight collection of debris in which the traveling screen was operated, on average, 15. 5 hours per night. (3) Ten-minute debris collections within the below-ground circular holding tank, coinciding with routine fish counts being made every 2 hours at the TFCF. Two hundred sixty-one fish were collected by the traveling screen during these three different evaluations. Of this total, 210 were dead, and 173 (66 percent) of these dead fish had been dead long before being collected, indicated by old injuries and decomposition of the body. The traveling screen has proven to be effective at removing green vegetative debris greater than 189 mm (7. 4 inches) and woody debris greater than 105 mm (4. 1 inches) in length or longer from the secondary channel. The experiments presented in this report demonstrate the effectiveness of the traveling screen, especially during routine cleaning operations and when debris loading is heavy...|$|R

40|$|We analyse active space <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> efforts from a strategic, game-theoretical perspective. Space debris is non-manoeuvrable, human-made objects {{orbiting}} Earth, which pose {{a significant}} threat to operational spacecraft. Active <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> missions {{have been considered}} and investigated by different space agencies with the goal to protect valuable assets present in strategic orbital environments. An active <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> mission is costly, but has a positive effect for all satellites in the same orbital band. This leads to a dilemma: each agency is faced with the choice between the individually costly action of <b>debris</b> <b>removal,</b> which has {{a positive impact on}} all players; or wait and hope that others jump in and do the ‘dirty’ work. The risk of the latter action is that, if everyone waits, the joint outcome will be catastrophic, leading to what in game theory {{is referred to as the}} ‘tragedy of the commons’. We introduce and thoroughly analyse this dilemma using empirical game theory and a space debris simulator. We consider two- and three-player settings, investigate the strategic properties and equilibria of the game and find that the cost/benefit ratio of <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> strongly affects the game dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The overall <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> after {{disasters}} {{is often}} prolonged {{due to the}} huge amount of debris and lack of capacities such as a Temporary Debris Management Site (TDMS) in the community. This results in a delay of overall recovery and increases the total recovery cost. Strategic planning and building a TDMS will help in providing extra time for proper disposal of debris and clearing a disaster-impacted site that will facilitate the reconstruction process. This paper presents a unique approach for identifying and selecting TDMS locations for expediting <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> from the community. A hypothetical example of a community impacted by a natural hazard is presented {{to explain how the}} the proposed model works. The research integrates data from a loss assessment report obtained from HAZUS-MH, Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), and Geographical Information System (GIS) in a dynamic simulation model. Various TDMS locations could be evaluated based on the existing capacity and infrastructure services and considering factors such as overall <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> time, associated cost, productivity, and availability of resources.

40|$|Space debris {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} hazardous obstacle to continued spaceflight operations. In an effort to mitigate this problem {{an investigation of the}} feasibility of a microsatellite active <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> system was conducted. Through proposing a novel concept of operation, utilizing a grapple-and-tug system architecture, and by analyzing each resultant mission phase in the frame of a representative example, it was found that microsatellite scale systems are capable of fulfilling the active <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> mission. Analysis of rendezvous, docking, control and deorbit mission requirements determined that the design of a grapple-and-tug system will be driven by sizing of the propellant required to deorbit the target vehicle. Further sensitivity analysis determined that target altitude and mass are critical factors in determining the capabilities of a microsatellite mission. Preliminary sizing demonstrated that hardware considerations for both satellite core and mission related activities do not impede microsatellite feasibility. Further investigation of microsatellite <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> missions including detailed design analysis and engineering is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{modeling}} {{studies on}} the instability of the debris population in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 have underlined the need for active <b>debris</b> <b>removal.</b> A 2009 analysis by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office shows that, {{in order to maintain}} the LEO debris population at a constant level for the next 200 years, an active <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> of about five objects per year is needed. The targets identified for removal are those with the highest mass and collision probability products in the environment. Many of these objects are spent upper stages with masses ranging from 1 to more than 8 metric tons, residing in several altitude regions and concentrated in about 10 inclination bands. To remove five of those objects on a yearly basis, in a cost-effective manner, represents many challenges in engineering, technology development, and operations. This paper outlines a conceptual end-to-end <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> operation, including launch, precision tracking, rendezvous, stabilization (of the tumbling targets), capture, and deorbit of the targets; and highlights major challenges associated with the operations. Pros and cons of several proposed removal techniques are also evaluated...|$|R
40|$|While the {{feasibility}} of laser space <b>debris</b> <b>removal</b> by high energy lasers {{has been shown in}} concept studies and laboratory proofs of principle, we address the question of the effectiveness and responsibility associated with this technique. The large variety of debris shapes poses a challenge for predicting amount and direction of the impulse imparted to the target. We present a numerical code that considers variation of fluence throughout the target surface with respect to the resulting local momentum coupling. Simple targets as well as an example for realistic space debris are investigated with respect to momentum generation. The predictability of the imparted momentum is analyzed in a Monte Carlo study. It was found that slight variations of the initial debris position and orientation may yield large differences of the modified trajectories. We identify highly cooperative targets, e. g., spheres, as well as targets that are strongly sensitive to orientation, e. g., plates, and exhibit a poor performance in laser <b>debris</b> <b>removal.</b> Despite limited predictability for the motion of a particular debris object, the laser-based approach appears to be suitable for space <b>debris</b> <b>removal,</b> albeit not with a deterministic but rather with a probabilistic treatment of the resulting trajectory modifications...|$|R
