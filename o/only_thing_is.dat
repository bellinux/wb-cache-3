5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
2500|$|Describing {{the show}} as {{simultaneously}} [...] "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick" [...] and calling Knowles [...] "the planet's greatest superstar", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce disc of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, saying, [...] "She worked, and worked it relentlessly, never missing a note, a beat of choreography, or a chance to strike a pose, hold it, and be adored." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented [...] "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage {{to the center of}} the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." [...] A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles [...] "brought all the fierceness" [...] on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in [...] "full view" [...] further praising the [...] "carefully" [...] choreographed show. Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, [...] " [...] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does—a complete package of voice, moves and presence." [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail awarded the performance five out of five stars and noted that Knowles' vocal abilities were showcased during the ballads of the show where she was [...] "note perfect throughout". She concluded her review by saying that although it was [...] "too early" [...] to compare Knowles with Michael Jackson, [...] "she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such." [...] Comparing her with Diana Ross and Tina Turner, Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that Knowles proved she was the [...] "world's best female performed" [...] with her performance and added, [...] "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever... Good luck trying to follow that act whoever you are." [...] Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as [...] "powerhouse" [...] and added, [...] "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott. Sometimes her booming vocals were so over the top she seemed to have come down with a case of Mariah Carey syndrome." [...] Writing that there were [...] "ska, reggae, girlish pop, jazz, rap, soul, gospel, Middle Eastern, rock and body-thumping club remixes", Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times added, [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> while she can wrap her voice and body around just about any style, she doesn't really have her own signature, at least musically. And while all the variety kept the concert interesting, it came off a little unfocused... But for a show that's as much about style as music, you gotta hand it to Beyoncé. The evening played out like a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, [...] "she is a performer who can shape-change at will. Whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyoncé is, above all, in charge. Probably the most 'in charge' of any female artist I've seen onstage... she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years." [...] However, she noted that Knowles is [...] "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical." [...] Noting influences by Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand during the tour, Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times writes: ...|$|E
