25|$|His <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to {{philosophy}} was De essentiis (On essences). In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo). He started {{to write this}} treatise in 1143 in Toulouse and he completed it the same year in Béziers. In 1982 this book was reprinted in Germany.|$|E
25|$|According to Bronkhorst, {{the four}} rūpa jhāna {{may be an}} <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> of the Buddha to the {{religious}} landscape of India. They formed {{an alternative to the}} painful ascetic practices of the Jains. The arūpa jhāna were incorporated from non-Buddhist ascetic traditions. According to Crangle, the development of meditative practices in ancient India was a complex interplay between Vedic and non-Vedic traditions.|$|E

25|$|Plautus {{was known}} {{for the use of}} Greek style in his plays, as part of the {{tradition}} of the variation on a theme. This has been a point of contention among modern scholars. One argument states that Plautus writes with originality and creativity—the other, that Plautus is a copycat of Greek New Comedy and that he makes no <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to playwriting.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{more than}} 30 {{notebooks}} and 3,000 pages {{of history and}} analysis during his imprisonment. His Prison Notebooks are considered a highly <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to 20th century political theory. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources – not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel and Benedetto Croce. The notebooks cover {{a wide range of}} topics, including Italian history and nationalism, the French Revolution, Fascism, Fordism, civil society, folklore, religion and high and popular culture.|$|E
25|$|From {{the reports}} of discussions {{published}} by the society, {{it would appear that}} the majority of the members accepted that evolution had occurred. However the discussions rarely mentioned Darwin's most <b>original</b> <b>contribution,</b> his proposed mechanism of natural selection; Darwin's ideas were considered as an extension to those of Lamarck. In contrast, even the possibility that evolution had occurred was rarely mentioned in the discussions of other learned societies such as the Société Botanique, the Société Zoologique, the Société Géologique and the Académie des Sciences.|$|E

25|$|Goltz was {{appointed}} {{professor at the}} military school at Potsdam in 1871, promoted to captain, {{and placed in the}} historical section of the general staff. It was then that he wrote Die Operationen der II. Armee bis zur Capitulation von Metz (The Operations of the Second Army until the surrender of Metz) and Die Sieben Tage von Le Mans (The Seven Days of Le Mans), both published in 1873. In 1874 he {{was appointed}} first general staff officer (Ia) of the 6th Division, and while so employed wrote Die Operationen der II. Armee an der Loire (The Operations of the Second Army on the Loire) and Léon Gambetta und seine Armeen (Léon Gambetta and his armies), published in 1875 and 1877 respectively. The latter was translated into French the same year, and is considered by many historians to be his most <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to military literature.|$|E
25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E

500|$|The nocturnes are {{generally}} considered to be among Sorabji's most accessible works, and they are also some of his most prestigious; they have been described by Habermann as the best of his output, and by the pianist Fredrik Ullén as [...] "perhaps... his most personal and <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> as a composer." [...] Sorabji's descriptions of his Symphony No. 2, Jāmī, give an insight into their organisation. In a 1942 letter, Sorabji compared this composition to his Gulistān—Nocturne for Piano, and he later wrote of the symphony's [...] "self-cohesive texture relying upon its own inner consistency and cohesiveness without relation to thematic or other matters". Melodic material is treated loosely in these works, reflecting their harmonic freedom; ornamentation and textural patterns assume a preeminent position. Because of their emphasis on non-thematic processes, the nocturnes have been described as [...] "static". Some examples of them are The Garden of Irām, Anāhata Cakra and Symphonic Nocturne for Piano Alone.|$|E
500|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{received}} two reviews in the Journal of Homosexuality, one by David A. Begelman, {{and the other}} by Fritz A. Fluckiger. Begelman gave the book a mixed assessment, calling Tripp a skillful writer who was learned {{on the subject of}} homosexuality, but whose objectivity was nevertheless open to question. Fluckiger gave the book a positive review, calling it [...] "easily the most provocative work on sexuality to have appeared in a long time" [...] and credited Tripp with offering a powerful challenge to established views about homosexuality and showing command of a range of data from many fields. Fluckiger maintained that Tripp offered the most novel account {{of the way in which}} behavioral expression communicates internal states since Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), but considered his most <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to be his explanation of how erotic feeling depends on [...] "resistance", which might consist of any of several impediments to easy access to sexual satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his career, Voight has {{received}} multiple accolades and citations for his research {{as a professor}} and for his professional work as a geologist and volcanologist. In 1984, the Institution of Civil Engineers awarded him the George Stephenson Medal, recognizing one of his articles as among [...] "the best work published in [...] journals". The same year, Voight earned an award for [...] "significant <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to research in rock mechanics" [...] from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics. For his help monitoring the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1985, he was granted a key to Legazpi, Albay, which had been threatened by Mayon's impending eruption. 1989 saw another major year of honors for Voight, as he was named a MacQuarie Research Scholar and again garnered an award from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics for his original findings. Voight has appeared as a distinguished lecturer several times, including at the University of Utah's College of Mining Engineering (1990), the University of California, Santa Barbara (1992), and the Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists (1992).|$|E

500|$|Ion Creangă ( [...] ; {{also known}} as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei, Ion Torcălău and Ioan Ștefănescu; March 1, 1837 – December 31, 1889) was a Moldavian, later Romanian writer, raconteur and schoolteacher. A main figure in 19th century Romanian literature, he {{is best known for}} his Childhood Memories volume, his novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes. Creangă's main {{contribution}} to fantasy and children's literature includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists ("Harap Alb", [...] "Ivan Turbincă", [...] "Dănilă Prepeleac", [...] "Stan Pățitul"), as well as fairy tales indebted to conventional forms ("The Story of the Pig", [...] "The Goat and Her Three Kids", [...] "The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law", [...] "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter"). Widely seen as masterpieces of the Romanian language and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an <b>original</b> <b>contribution</b> to a literary realism of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature, collectively known as his [...] "corrosives".|$|E
