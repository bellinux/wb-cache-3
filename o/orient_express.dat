5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express,</b> the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express,</b> as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> {{retains the}} main plot {{elements}} of Agatha Christie's {{novel of the}} same name. An additional ending {{is presented in the}} game which differs from the conclusion of Christie's novel. As with And Then There Were None, Christie's novel is bundled with the game. Some reviewers of Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> criticized the game because of the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to And Then There Were None, as well as convincing voice acting and audio effects. Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> is followed by , the third installment in the Agatha Christie series.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And Then There Were None, Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely the same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E

40|$|The use of lipid monolayers to bind and adsorb {{proteins}} is {{an attractive}} and increasingly important method for generating high localized concentrations of oriented proteins and protein complexes. These bound proteins can be imaged directly, or they may form 2 -D crystalline arrays that are amenable to structure determination by single particle analysis or 2 -D electron crystallography. 2 -D crystals grown by this technique {{can also be used}} to initiate the growth of 3 -D crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Many derivatized lipids have been prepared for use with this technique, incorporating a diverse range of ligands to enable binding to specific proteins. Synthetic lipids containing functionalized head groups that chelate Ni 2 + or Cu 2 + have also been prepared to bind and <b>orient</b> <b>expressed</b> proteins that contain His-tags. Protein-binding monolayer-forming lipids generally consist of two distinct components: (1) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity to the monolayer and (2) a functionalized hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of protein molecules at the air-water interface. Newer examples of these compounds also incorporate perfluorinated hydrocarbon moieties to confer detergent resistance to these lipids. This review focuses on synthetic approaches to functionalized lipids for protein monolayer crystallizations...|$|R
40|$|This article uses Letters {{from the}} Future (a health {{promotion}} instrument) {{to explore the}} human capacity of imagining the future. From a narrative perspective, letters from the future {{are considered to be}} indicative of a variety of forms through which human beings construct and understand their future selves and worlds. This is consistent with an interpretive approach to understanding the human mind, which offers an alternative for the current dominant causal-explanatory approach in psychology. On the basis of qualitative analysis of 480 letters from the future, collected online from a diverse group of Dutch and German persons, we first identified five narrative processes operating in the letters: imagining, evaluating, <b>orienting,</b> <b>expressing</b> emotions and engaging in dialogue. Second, using comparative analysis, we identified six types of how these processes are organized in the letters as a whole. These types differ regarding functionality (which of the five processes was dominant); temporality (prospective, retrospective and present-oriented); {{the extent to which a}} path between present and future was described; and the vividness of the imagination. We suggest that these types can be used in narrative health practice as ‘pathways’ to locate where letter writers are on their path to imagine the future, rather than as a normative taxonomy. Future research should focus on how these pathways can be used to navigate to health and well-bein...|$|R

5|$|The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet {{counter-intelligence}} agency, {{to assassinate}} Bond {{in such a}} way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express.</b> The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of The Sunday Times to report on an Interpol conference; he returned to Britain by the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express.</b> From Russia, with Love deals with the East–West tensions of the Cold War, and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> {{begins with}} the Armstrong {{kidnapping}} redated and relocated in New Paltz, New York City, during 1924, in which police officers surround an unidentified house. After a brief gun battle, two men {{walk out of the}} house and surrender.|$|E

5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express,</b> characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E

5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express,</b> widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express,</b> as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.|$|E

It was used for boat trains to Dover and Folkestone until these were made redundant {{by the introduction of}} Eurostar trains to the continent in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> {{came from}} two sources: Fleming had {{returned}} from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the <b>Orient</b> <b>Express</b> from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E
