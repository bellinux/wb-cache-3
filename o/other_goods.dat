5|$|Kastner's {{reasons for}} not making the {{document}} public are unknown. Vrba believed {{until the end of}} his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed to the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest (specifically to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand) that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but in exchange for money and <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage those negotiations with the SS.|$|E
5|$|As a {{steamship}} line connecting northern {{cities and}} the south, the Old Bay Line hauled a considerable volume of freight between the two regions and their ships' cargo holds were filled with bales of cotton, produce, and <b>other</b> <b>goods.</b> When hostilities commenced, Southern ports were blockaded by the Federal Navy and the Old Bay Line was unable to serve Norfolk {{for the duration of}} the war, going no further south than Old Point Comfort. Passenger traffic as well as cargo shipping declined significantly. The Powhatan Line discontinued operations altogether between Norfolk and Richmond until the war's end.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} {{came under}} two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and <b>other</b> <b>goods.</b> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.|$|E

5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to <b>other</b> <b>goods)</b> {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination.

Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E

The city kept its trading role and was a center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms, it received goods {{from the south and}} east through riverboats and distributed them north, north west and west. The main merchandises handled by Mari were metals and tin imported from the Iranian Plateau and then exported west as far as Crete. <b>Other</b> <b>goods</b> included copper from Cyprus, silver from Anatolia, woods from Lebanon, gold from Egypt, olive oil, wine, and textiles in addition to precious stones from modern Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|Two {{accounts}} exist {{regarding the}} adoption of Rakotomavo, whom Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana designated to rule after him as King Andriambelomasina. According to the first version, Rakotomavo and Mandriamohara were sons of Rangorimanana. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana sent messengers to Ranorimanana to bring the boys to him with the instructions {{to take note of}} which child stood closer to the central pillar (andry, symbolic of strength) of their mother's house. When the boys entered the house, Rakotomavo stood closer to the pillar. The children's relatives refused to allow the messengers to take the children, so the king sent them back with rice, milk, honey and <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> and successfully lured the boys away.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for <b>other</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bounty {{arrived at}} Tubuai on 28 May 1789. The {{reception}} from the native population was hostile; when a flotilla of war canoes {{headed for the}} ship, Christian used a four-pounder gun to repel the attackers. At least a dozen warriors were killed, and the rest scattered. Undeterred, Christian and an armed party surveyed the island, and {{decided it would be}} suitable for their purposes. However, to create a permanent settlement, they needed compliant native labour and women. The most likely source for these was Tahiti, to which Bounty returned on 6 June. To ensure the co-operation of the Tahiti chiefs, Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh, and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> and, on 16 June, the well-provisioned Bounty sailed back to Tubuai. On board were nearly 30 Tahitian men and women, some of whom were there by deception.|$|E
5|$|By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian {{trade with}} Byblos yielded a {{critical}} source of quality timber {{not found in}} Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, {{which had to be}} imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among <b>other</b> <b>goods,</b> supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E
