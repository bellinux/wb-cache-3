500|$|The {{black vulture}} lays its eggs {{on the ground}} in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than [...] above the ground. While it {{generally}} does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps. Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures [...] The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle,</b> a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.|$|E
2500|$|The white-fronted {{capuchin}} frequently {{travels with}} the common squirrel monkey {{and at other times}} with the tufted capuchin and Venezuelan red howler. The double-toothed kite often accompanies these monkeys, exactly as it does other species of primates. The white-fronted capuchin feels threatened by avian predators, and it is very vigilant around any large bird of prey. In Vichada, Colombia, tayra, Boa constrictor and the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> have been seen trying to capture the monkey. After detecting the tayra and Boa constrictor the members of the troop showed little fear and caution, even though these animals threatened the monkeys.

50|$|Coati predators include jaguarundis, boa constrictors, foxes, dogs, tayras, ocelots, and jaguars. Large raptors, such as <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagles,</b> black-and-chestnut eagles, and harpy eagles, {{also are}} known to hunt them. White-headed {{capuchin}} monkeys hunt their pups.|$|R
50|$|Wedge-capped capuchins {{have been}} {{observed}} to give alarm calls if they observe a potential predator. Such predators include jaguars, ocelots, tayras, boa constrictors, caimans, and collared peccaries. In addition, alarm calls {{have been observed}} when the capuchin sees one of several birds, such as hook-billed kites, black vultures, green ibises, rufous-vented chachalacas, harpy eagles, or <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagles.</b> Due to these predators, the wedge-capped capuchin has taken to living in groups; as group size increases, vigilance per animal decreases, though {{it has not yet}} been demonstrated that capuchins in larger groups are any less vulnerable than those in smaller groups.|$|R
50|$|The male {{great curassow}} may build the nest and attract a female's {{attention}} to it, though {{in other cases}} both members of a pair will build the nest structure. Two eggs are typically laid in a relatively small nest (usually made largely of leaves), each egg measuring 9.1 x 6.7 cm and weighing 200 g. The young curassow weighs 123 g upon hatching; 2760 g as a half-year-old immature fledgling; and by a year of age, when fully fledged and independent of parental care, will be about three-quarters of their adult weight at 3600 g. This species has been noted for its rather aggressive temperament, which has been regularly directed at humans when the birds are held in captivity. Undoubtedly, they have this inclination in order to repel natural predators, from both themselves and their offspring. Known natural predators of this species have included ocelots and <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagles,</b> though chicks and eggs likely have {{a broader range of}} predators. When a potential predator is near their offspring, curassows have been noted to engage in a distraction display, feigning injury. When attacking humans, the curassows leap in fluttering flight and scratch about the head, targeting the eyes. Their lifespan in captivity has reached at least 24 years.|$|R

50|$|The {{black hawk-eagle}} (Spizaetus tyrannus), {{also known as}} thetyrant hawk-eagle, is a species of eagle found from central Mexico to eastern Peru, the south of Brazil, and far {{northern}} Argentina. Its preferred habitats include humid and moist forests close to rivers, and several types of woodland. It is uncommon to fairly common throughout most of its range. Its closest relative is the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle,</b> which is similar in size, appearance and behavior but lives at lower elevations.|$|E
50|$|This species inhabits {{the humid}} lowland forests of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The slow {{flight of the}} red-throated caracara makes it suited it to fly in the {{understory}} of the forest where the vegetation is thin. The sparse vegetation gives the red-throated caracara greater visibility to spot food and predators. The <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> and the black-and-white hawk-eagle are predators of the red-throated caracara.|$|E
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagle {{is hard to}} confuse with any other bird in its range. The black-faced hawk (Leucopternis melanops) is very similar in overall coloration, but it is much smaller and has a black tail with a single bold white bar in the middle. The <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> (Spizaetus ornatus), presumably a very close relative of S. melanoleucus, looks quite similar when young. However, the wings, back and tail are much lighter in young S. ornatus, {{and they do not}} have the black eye-ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{period of}} parental {{dependence}} following a 40 to 45-day incubation period and an 85-day fledging period is {{between one and}} two years depending on climatic conditions before young are independent of parents and helpers, which is the longest of any bird. This means that ground hornbills can normally breed successfully only every third year. Triennial breeding is extremely rare in birds: probably the only other bird which breeds on a triennial basis is the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> of Neotropical rainforests.|$|E
50|$|The park is home a rich {{variety of}} fauna, {{including}} several endangered species.

Other species include the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), jaguar (Panthera onca), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus) and <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> (Spizaetus ornatus), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), Titi monkey species, toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), black curassow (Crax alector) and grey-winged trumpeter (Psophia crepitans).The endangered white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) {{is found in the}} park.The park is also home to the Neblina uakari (Cacajao hosomi).|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is found}} in humid {{tropical}} forests from southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, to Trinidad and Tobago, south to Peru and Argentina. They are able to tolerate some degree of habitat fragmentation, breeding successfully near cities and in forest fragments as small as 200 ha. Despite a slender build and a body weight no greater than a large Buteo hawk, the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> is a notably powerful predator which, like other booted eagles, can take prey up to five times its own weight. Birds are the principal prey. Prey items have ranged in size from 180 g to 8 kg when taken. Prey species have included little blue herons, curassows, toucans, wood quail, pigeons, macaws, parrots, cotingas, chickens, and even a black vulture. Mammals are also significant prey, with agoutis, squirrels, rats, procyonids, and monkeys often taken. Reptiles are also occasionally hunted.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{the presence}} of a number of species in the protected area considered endangered or vulnerable, and in need of protection within Belize. These include one of the two large game species (the great curassow), and the keel-billed motmot (Electron carinatum). The near threatened harpy eagle (Harpia harpyia) has also been recorded from Bladen (Marlin, pers. com., 2006, 2010) and in December 2010 researchers from Belize Foundation for Research and Environmental Education (BFREE) discovered a breeding pair of harpy eagles with a chick, the first ever recorded in Belize and also representing the extreme of their northerly range. The rare solitary eagle (Harpyhaliaetus solitarius) has been recorded from the adjacent Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Doyle’s Delight, with a high probability that its range includes Bladen. Other birds highlighted as being of concern include the second large game species crested guan (P. purpurascens), the <b>ornate</b> <b>hawk-eagle</b> (Spizaetus ornatus), and seasonally, the regionally endangered subspecies of the scarlet macaw (Ara Macao).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Neotropical hawk-eagles (Spizaetus spp.) {{are large}} forest raptors, having low {{population}} densities and high sensitivity to human disturbance. The three species of Brazil’s Atlantic forest (S. ornatus, S. melanoleucus, S. tyrannus) are threatened and {{little is known}} of many aspects of their biology, such habitat requirements, nesting behavior, and food habitats. Here I present data about the breeding biology, diet and behavior of the <b>Ornate</b> <b>Hawk-Eagle</b> (S. ornatus; OHE) and the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle (S. melanoleucus; BWHW), and estimations of distribution - extent of occurrence (EOO) - and population sizes for the three hawk-eagles of the southern Atlantic Forest. I compiled data from nine years of field studies done in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina combined with data from the literature (n = 191 records). I calculated {{the total amount of}} forest available for each species by GIS analyses and estimated population sizes based on species density data from the literature. The EOO was 123, 551 km² for BWHE, 92, 512 km² for OHE, and 67, 824 km² for Black Hawk-Eagle (S. tyrannus; BHE). All species experienced more than 30 % shrinkage in their historical distribution (before the year 2000). Forest remnants comprise 32 % of BHE’s EOO and around 20 % for other hawk-eagle species. Population sizes estimated for the southern region were 869 pairs for BHE (1, 684 individuals), 1, 532 pairs for BWHE (2, 849 individuals), and 2, 020 pairs for OHE (1, 192 individuals). Population size estimates based only on forest patches larger than 10 km² were 542 pairs for BHE (RS = 48 pairs; SC = 494 pairs), 818 pairs for BWHE (RS = 67 pairs; SC = 751 pairs), and 1, 178 pairs for OHE (RS = 67 pairs; SC = 1, 111 pairs). I recorded displays and copulation of BWHE in July; the nest was built in an inaccessible, emergent tree in the hillside of a valley. Two nests of OHE were found in emergent trees (20 m and 30 m height) measured 138 x 115 x 45 cm and 132 x 100 x 100 cm; one egg was found (64. 5 x 51. 1 mm). Spizaetus seems to have very variable breeding cycles and begin breeding in the austral winter. I estimated egg laying occurs from July to September with fledging happening 3 - 4 months later. Diet of OHE consisted mostly of birds (90 %) but also some mammals. Individuals of Spizaetus require large, unbroken forest areas to live, and my data reinforce the critical situation of hawk-eagles in southern Atlantic forest. All three species have lost habitat and their distributions have shrunk over the past decades. The estimated population sizes suggest concern and a need for conservation actions. Conservation of large raptors in the Atlantic Forest is not a simple task, requiring the need to preserve and limit the disturbance of remaining forests, establish connectivity among fragments and reduce direct threats to raptors (e. g., persecution). We also need to better understand the ecological requirements of hawk-eagles and establish public policies to protect both species and their habitats...|$|E
