40|$|The ERS- 2 deorbiting {{started on}} 6 th July 2011 after 16 years of {{successful}} operations of this ESA Earth Observation satellite. Many <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> maneuvers {{were necessary to}} reach the target altitude of 570 km. Apart from the late failure of a backup gyro, which had {{no impact on the}} overall activity, all subsystems onboard performed perfectly. Although not originally foreseen in the early mission days, the later decision to deorbit ERS- 2 was mostly compliant with international guidelines and ESA requirements on space debris mitigation and ensured a re-entry of the satellite in less than 25 years. The ERS- 2 deorbiting was the first such activity of an ESA polar orbiting satellite. It was started with an initial re-orbiting in Feb 2011 in order to achieve a 3 -days repeat cycle for scientific reasons for a period of 3 months. This orbit change served as a dress rehearsal for the later <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> maneuvers and platform operations. The deorbiting related operations were implemented at ESA’s Op-erations Centre ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, in close collaboration with the Mission Management, the ESTEC based Post Launch Support Office and industrial support by ASTRIUM Toulouse. This included the definition of the overall operations concept, the ma-neuver strategy, on-board configuration trade-offs, contingency plans, new and modified procedures, extensive simulation and training sessions and an extended ground station net-work. This paper summarizes these activities together with the deorbiting background and objectives, timeline and results...|$|E
40|$|The General Tethered Object Simulation System (GTOSS) {{has been}} {{successfully}} converted to the PC environment. GTOSS has been run under Microsoft Windows 95, 98 and NT 4. 0 with no problems noted. Adaptation to the PC environment and definition of the 3 three body configuration required resizing some of the GTOSS internal data arrays. To allow studies of the tether dynamics accompanying electrodynamic thrust, a tether current flow model has also been developed for GTOSS. This model includes effects due to the earth's magnetic field and ionosphere, tether conductivity, temperature, motion, shape and available power. Sample cases have been defined for a proposed STEP-AIRSEDS (Space Transfer using Electrodynamic Propulsion-The Michigan Technic Corporation proposed tether missions for commercial applications) three body configuration. This required definition of a 6 th power scenario for GTOSS. This power scenario allows a user to specify whether orbit raising or <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> is to be performed by selecting {{the number of the}} tether. Orbit raising and <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> sample cases have been run successfully. Results from these runs have been included in this report. Results have only been generated so far for a three body configuration. Only point end masses have been represented. No attitude dynamics have been included. Initial results suggest that tether current can have significant and detrimental effects on tether dynamics and provisions will have to be made for control of it. This control will have to be considered in connection with desired target orbits for electrodynamic thrusting, as well as end body attitude control, momentum management of proposed control moment gyros, solar array pointing. All of these items will interact and thus, any system simulation will have to have each of these effects modeled in sufficient detail to display these interactions...|$|E
40|$|The Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) {{mission is}} a {{demonstration}} of the <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> capabilities of an electrodynamic tether. The system is sequenced through various electrical modes, involving both open circuit and closed circuit configurations, so that the performance capabilities of the system can be studied. Ionospheric electrons are collected on {{the upper end of the}} bare tether, conducted through the tether, and returned to the ionosphere at the lower end (Delta I 1 2 nd stage) via the operation of a Hollow Cathode Plasma Contactor (HCPC). The working gas of the HCPC is xenon. Environmental plasma measurements and sheath potential are obtained from the Differential Ion Flux Probe w/Mass Analysis (DIFPM) and Langmuir Probe and Spacecraft Potential (LPSP) instruments. Each instrument has three sensors symmetrically placed about the strut section of the Delta 2 nd stage. A magnetometer is also included in the ProSEDS instrumentation suite. An initial analysis of the rocket stage sheath behavior as a function of ProSEDS configuration (open or closed circuit), ambient ionospheric density, orientation to velocity vector (ram-wake influence), and magnetic field orientation is presented. An initial assessment on how well the plasma contactor grounded the rocket stage is also presented...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{a control}} method is {{developed}} for the solar sail normal vector to trace a desired circular coning trajectory at orbit rate. The coning trajectory is defined in the local vertical local horizontal (LVLH) frame and the coning occurs about an LVLH equilibrium sail attitude. Past {{research has shown that}} sail attitude equilibria exist in the LVLH frame under the influence of aerodynamic, gravity gradient and solar torques. Precession of the sail normal from these equilibria causes sail normal coning about that equilibrium attitude. If the coning happens at orbit rate, wide variety of orbital effects can be induced with minimum excitation of the sailcraft structure. This results in an inexpensive spacecraft with a longer duration mission as compared to other conventional efforts. A special case of analyzing circular cones (at orbit rate coning) revealed that new Sun-synchronous orbits were created and launch injection errors were overcome by employing the sail coning method. The control method herein minimizes the angular momentum error between the sail and desired angular momentum vectors at orbit rate. Since angular momentum is a function of sail normal, angular momentum error reduction raises hope in reducing the sail normal error between the sail normal and desired sail normal vector as well. The results show that even though the control method enables the sail angular momentum to track the desired angular momentum on the coning trajectory, the sail normal tracing can only occur about certain LVLH equilibrium points, for small cones and small initial condition angular position/velocity errors. The control method is robust for tracking the desired angular momentum at orbit rate, but not always for tracking the desired sail normal. The case where the sail normal does track the desired at orbit rate corresponds to tracing a 1 ° circular cone about an <b>orbit</b> <b>lowering</b> LVLH equilibrium point. Even though the control torques are on the order of 10 - 6 Nm (acceptable on small sailcraft) for both a spinning and non-spinning sail, a spinning sail (spun at a specific rate) requires less control torque (4 times lower than a non-spinning sail) to yield the desired orbit rate circular coning. The control torques {{can be applied to the}} sailcraft to enable orbit rate cone tracing of the sail normal and yield the desired orbital effects...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} stability criteria of Hill and that of Laplace to determine the stability of outer planetary orbits encircling binary stars. The restricted, analytically determined results of Hill's method by Szebehely and coworkers and the general, numerically integrated results of Laplace's method by Graziani and Black (1981) are compared for varying values of the mass parameter mu. For mu = 0 to 0. 15, the closest <b>orbit</b> (<b>lower</b> limit of radius) an outer planet in a binary system can have and still remain stable is determined by Hill's stability criterion. For mu greater than 0. 15, the critical radius is determined by Laplace's stability criterion.

50|$|Eventually the {{satellite}} comes around to point D where Earth's gravity is now reducing {{the satellite}}'s orbital velocity.

50|$|To {{properly}} understand spacecraft rendezvous it {{is essential}} to understand the relation between spacecraft velocity and orbit.

50|$|The Saturn V that {{launched}} Apollo 15 was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready {{model of the}} rocket.

These two changes meant 1100 lb more could be launched. The propellant reserves were reduced {{and the number of}} retrorockets on the S-IC first stage (used to separate the spent first stage from the S-II second stage) reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer before being shut down (see Saturn V {{for more information on the}} launch sequence).

50|$|Near-polar {{orbiting}} satellites commonly {{choose a}} Sun-synchronous orbit, meaning that each successive orbital pass {{occurs at the}} same local time of day. This can be particularly important for applications such as remote sensing atmospheric temperature, where {{the most important thing}} to see may well be changes over time which are not aliased onto changes in local time. To keep the same local time on a given pass, the time period of the orbit must be kept as short as possible, this is achieved by keeping the <b>orbit</b> <b>lower</b> to the Earth. However, very low orbits of a few hundred kilometers rapidly decay due to drag from the atmosphere. Commonly used altitudes are between 700 km and 800 km, producing an orbital period of about 100 minutes. The half-orbit on the Sun side then takes only 50 minutes, during which local time of day does not vary greatly.|$|R

The structural modes of the solar cell array are analyzed and found to be well within control limitations. Preliminary calculations concerning the free floating mirror and its position-keeping propellant requirements are also performed.

50|$|Deploying CubeSats from ISS has {{a number}} of benefits.

40|$|SWIM (Space Weather using Ion Spectrometers and Magnetometers) is a CubeSat to be {{launched}} {{with the purpose of}} studying interaction between the Sun and the Earth. A magnetometer will be placed in a boom which provides gravity gradient stabilization. SWIM will be inserted in a 600 km circular orbit and it is required to maintain a LVLH (Local Vertical Local Horizontal) position. This master thesis analyses the dynamical behavior of SWIM. For doing so an attitude simulator and a mass model have been developed. Mass model has been designed according to linear stability analysis. Simulations with the mass model have been carried out from the most ideal environment to realistic orbit. As a result it has been deduced that gravity gradient stabilization propagates initial conditions which are perturbed by aerodynamic and magnetic torques. Magnetic torques could lead to uncontrolled yaw spin. Additionally the deployment of two solar panels to guarantee passive stabilization for yaw axes has been studied. Three axes stabilization and LVLH pointing can be achieved in an <b>orbit</b> <b>lower</b> than 600 km...|$|R
