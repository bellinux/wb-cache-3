He takes <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> warehouse, exiting the two-mile radius his {{tracking}} anklet allows him to stay within. Peter is alerted at the FBI headquarters that Neal has bolted. Peter believes that Neal has run off in search of Kate; however, he tracks him to Hagen's warehouse. With Neal, a convicted felon, inside the warehouse, Peter now has probable cause to enter. He does, and discovers Hagen running a massive counterfeiting operation. Hagen and his men are taken into custody, and Peter remarks to Neal that this is the third time Neal has been caught.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the rebels}} {{concealed}} their motives, declaring that {{they intended to}} join the campaign. Yet their failure to arrive ultimately forced Köprülü Mehmed to depart without them, and he set <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> frontier on 24 June 1658. It {{was only then that}} Abaza Hasan and his compatriots revealed their true intentions by sending an emissary to Sultan Mehmed IV, and declaring that continuing to serve the state was intolerable so long as Köprülü Mehmed was not killed. They stated that their revolt was a response to the grand vizier having killed so many innocent men, and their fear that he would turn on them next. The rebel army then began its march from Konya to Bursa, the premier city of Ottoman Anatolia. Along the way Abaza Hasan issued orders preventing his troops from looting the countryside in an attempt to establish his public image as a fighter for justice. Yet even when his army surrounded Bursa and occupied the nearby towns and villages, the sultan continued to decisively stand behind his grand vizier and reject the demands of the rebels, referring to them as the servants of the Devil. Bursa successfully resisted the rebels throughout thirty days of siege, despite the defection of its commander Kenan Pasha to the rebel side. Abaza Hasan's failure to capture this city proved decisive in undermining the long-term viability of his revolt.|$|E

[...] Edson, speaking to those around him, stated, [...] "I guess we better call them off. They can't seem to cross the river." [...] Puller angrily replied, [...] "You're not going to throw these men away!" [...] apparently in reference to his men trapped {{on the west side of}} the Matanikau, and [...] "stormed" [...] <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> beach where, with the help of his personal signalman, Puller was able to hail the Navy destroyer [...] that was supporting the operation. Once aboard Monssen, Puller and the destroyer led 10 landing craft towards Point Cruz and established communications with Kelley on the ridge by signal flag.|$|E
500|$|Having {{withdrawn}} from the village, {{the next morning the}} Acadian and Mi'kmaq militia waited in the woods for Church and his men to arrive. [...] At the break of day, the New Englanders again set <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> village, under orders from Church to drive any resistance before them. [...] The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders' right flank from behind trees and logs, but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off. [...] The raiders then entered the village and began plundering. [...] Some of the men broke into the liquor stores they found and began drinking, but Colonel Church quickly put a stop to that activity. [...] They {{spent the rest of the}} day destroying much of the village. [...] According to one of Church's dispatches, they destroyed 60 houses, 6 mills, and many barns, along with about 70 cattle.|$|E
500|$|The final {{stroke of}} the battle belonged to the British. Around 3 pm, Riedesel sent a {{messenger}} to Burgoyne for instructions. He returned two hours later with orders to guard the baggage train, but also to send as many men as he could spare toward the American right flank. In a calculated risk, Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> action {{with the rest of}} his column. Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right, and Fraser's force threatened to turn the American left flank. In response to the latter threat, [...] Arnold requested more forces, and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned's brigade (2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts). (If Arnold had been on the field, these forces might have instead faced the larger danger posed by Riedesel's force.) Fortunately for the American right, darkness set in, bringing an end to the battle. The Americans retreated back to their defenses, leaving the British on the field.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{force that}} stepped <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Union {{positions}} at about 2 p.m. consisted of about 12,500 men. Although the attack is popularly called a [...] "charge", the men marched deliberately in line, {{to speed up}} and then charge only when they were within {{a few hundred yards}} of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600m) front. The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line and were slowed by fences in their path. Initially sloping down, the terrain changed to a gentle upward incline approximately midway between the lines. These obstacles played a large role in the increasing number of casualties the advancing Confederates faced. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting [...] "Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!" [...] in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. Fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's concealed artillery positions north of Little Round Top raked the Confederate right flank, while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to canister and musket fire as the Confederates came within 400yards of the Union line. The mile-long front shrank to less than half a mile (800m) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency {{to move away from the}} flanking fire.|$|E

Some accounts and maps began to place the [...] "Caspian Mountains", and Gog and Magog, just outside the Great Wall of China. The Tartar Relation, an obscure account of Friar Carpini's 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, [...] "where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen {{are said to have}} been shut in by Alexander", were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> mountains on approach. In 1251, the French friar André de Longjumeau informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog ("Got and Margoth") people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains.|$|E
2500|$|Feed {{illumination}} taper - The maximum {{gain for}} any aperture antenna is only achieved when {{the intensity of}} the radiated beam is constant across the entire aperture area. [...] However the radiation pattern from the feed antenna usually tapers <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> outer part of the dish, so the outer parts of the dish are [...] "illuminated" [...] with a lower intensity of radiation. [...] Even if the feed provided constant illumination across the angle subtended by the dish, the outer parts of the dish are farther away from the feed antenna than the inner parts, so the intensity would drop off with distance from the center. [...] So {{the intensity of the}} beam radiated by a parabolic antenna is maximum {{at the center of the}} dish and falls off with distance from the axis, reducing the efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1944, the 506th PIR {{took part}} in Operation Market Garden, an {{airborne}} operation in the Netherlands. On 5 October 1944, a German force attacked the 2nd Battalion's flank and threatened {{to break through the}} American lines. At the same time, four men in an Easy Company patrol were wounded. Returning to the headquarters, they reported that they had encountered a large group of Germans at a crossroads about [...] to the east of the company command post. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Winters took one squad from 1st Platoon, and moved <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> crossroads, where they observed a German machine gun firing to the south, toward the battalion headquarters, from a long distance. After surveying the position, Winters led the squad in an assault on the gun crew. Soon after taking the position, the squad took fire from a German position opposite them. Estimating that this position was held by at least a platoon, Winters called for reinforcements {{from the rest of the}} 1st Platoon, and led them in a successful assault. Later it was discovered there had been at least 300 Germans.|$|E
2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day last week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom <b>off.</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> end of the runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious {{in the hospital for}} hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E
