40|$|At the International Maritime Organization (IMO) the new {{generation}} intact stability criteria is now under development. This paper describes a current status of this development for facilitating discussion among experts in stability research. It was already agreed to consist of 3 levelled criteria and onboard <b>operational</b> <b>guidances</b> for four different stability failure modes, which include pure loss of stability, parametric rolling, broaching and stability under dead ship condition. Member states submitted available methodologies with sample calculation results so far but the first level criteria for pure loss of stability and parametric rolling are still missing and the first level criterion for broaching is required to be further upgraded. More verification and validation are essential for finalising this criterion set...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} searching for a target that moves between a hiding area and an oper-ating area over multiple fixed routes. The search is carried out {{with one or more}} cookie-cutter sensors, which can detect the target instantly once the target comes within the detection radius of the sensor. In the hiding area, the target is shielded from being detected. The residence times of the target, respectively, in the hiding area and in the operating area, are exponentially distributed. These dwell times are mathematically described by Markov transition rates. The decision of which route the target will take on each travel to and back from the operating area is governed by a probability distribution. We study the mathematical formulation of this search problem and ana-lytically solve for the mean time to detection. Based on the mean time to capture, we evaluate the performance of placing the searcher(s) to monitor various travel route(s) or to scan the operating area. The optimal search design is the one that minimizes the mean time to detection. We find that in many situations the optimal search design is not the one suggested by the straightforward in-tuition. Our analytical results can provide <b>operational</b> <b>guidances</b> to homeland security, military...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} the entry guidance for the Space Shuttle Orbiter. This guidance provides the steering commands for trajectory control from initial penetration of the earth's atmosphere until the terminal area guidance is activated at an earth-relative speed of 2500 fps. At this point, the Orbiter is at a distance of about 50 nmi from the runway threshold, and at an altitude of about 80, 000 ft. The entry guidance design is based on an analytic solution of the equations of motion defining the drag acceleration profile that meets the terminal criteria of the entry flight while maintaining the flight within systems and <b>operational</b> constraints. <b>Guidance</b> commands, which are based on a control law that ensures damping of oscillatory type trajectory motion, are computed to steer the Orbiter to this drag acceleration profile...|$|R
