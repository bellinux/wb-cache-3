It is the seventh episode of the Commander Keen series, though it is numbered as the sixth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through an alien world to rescue his kidnapped babysitter. The game feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and <b>other</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by David A. Palmer Productions {{and published by}} Activision in May 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Part of the Commander Keen series, it was released {{ten years after the}} first seven episodes in 1990–91. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through three alien worlds to collect three plasma crystals to prevent the weapon they power, built by several enemies from previous games, from destroying the universe. The game features Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and <b>other</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to widespread media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, <b>other</b> <b>hazards</b> included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>hazards</b> include venomous snakes, {{including}} the Eastern timber rattlesnake and copperhead, which are common along the trail. Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier {{sections of the}} trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the New Jersey–New York state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in Connecticut and have been reported, although rarely, {{as far north as}} New Hampshire. Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer; elk, reintroduced in the Smoky Mountains; and moose, which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward.|$|E
5|$|Space Run is a tower defense {{video game}} {{developed}} by PassTech Games {{and published by}} Focus Home Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows on June 13, 2014, and later released for OS X and Linux. The player assumes {{the role of a}} cargo ship pilot, and must build modules and weapons to defend their cargo from attacking ships and <b>other</b> <b>hazards.</b> The game received mixed reviews from critics, and a sequel was announced in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. <b>Other</b> <b>hazards</b> such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
50|$|All {{clear is}} the signal, {{generally}} given by an civil defence siren, {{which indicates that}} an air raid or <b>other</b> <b>hazard</b> has finished {{and that it is}} safe for civilians to leave their shelters.|$|R

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of a combination of}} several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers <b>other</b> <b>hazards</b> with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings {{can be very}} tame in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. <b>Other</b> <b>hazards</b> include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various <b>other</b> <b>hazards</b> in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
50|$|A {{combustible}} liquid means any liquid {{that does not}} meet the definition of any <b>other</b> <b>hazard</b> class specified in this subchapter and has a flash point above 60.5 °C (141 °F) and below 93 °C (200 °F).|$|R

5|$|Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy (stylized as Goodbye, Galaxy!) is {{a two-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by id Software {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1991 for MS-DOS. It consists of the fifth and sixth episodes of the Commander Keen series, though they are numbered as the fourth and fifth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he first journeys through the Shadowlands to rescue the Gnosticenes so they may ask the Oracle how the Shikadi plan to destroy the galaxy, and then through the Shikadi's Armageddon Machine to stop them. The two episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and <b>other</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is {{a three-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by Ideas from the Deep (a precursor to id Software) {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1990 for MS-DOS. It is {{the first set of}} episodes of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he retrieves the stolen parts of his spaceship from the cities of Mars, prevents a recently arrived alien mothership from destroying landmarks on Earth, and hunts down the leader of the aliens, the Grand Intellect, on the alien home planet. The three episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and <b>other</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. <b>Other</b> <b>hazards</b> faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

5|$|The second {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action {{platformer}} for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It {{is one of two}} video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and <b>other</b> <b>hazards</b> in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and <b>other</b> <b>hazards</b> from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|E

50|$|Some airfields {{now have}} a special surface known as soft {{concrete}} {{at the end of}} the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or <b>other</b> <b>hazard,</b> and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.|$|R
