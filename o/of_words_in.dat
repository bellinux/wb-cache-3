The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.|$|E

25|$|Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values {{reflect the}} radical {{simplification}} of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into {{a much smaller}} number.

As a consequence, the spellings <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable.|$|E
