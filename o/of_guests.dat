40|$|Confocal Raman microspectrometry {{is used to}} probe, for {{the first}} time, the {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> molecules along the one-dimensional tunnels in a crystalline urea inclusion compound under conditions <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> exchange in which new guest molecules are introduced simultaneously {{at both ends of}} the urea tunnel structure. We focus on the system comprising 1, 8 -dibromooctane as the original type <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> and pentadecane as the new type <b>of</b> <b>guest,</b> and results are presented for experiments in which the guest exchange process is probed both ex situ and in situ. The Raman data, recorded as a function of position along the tunnel direction and, in the case of the in situ experiments, as a function of time, demonstrate that pentadecane guest molecules enter the tunnels {{at both ends of the}} crystal and that transport <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> molecules occurs in both directions along the crystal. Mechanistic aspects of this bidirectional transport process are discussed, particularly in relation to the corresponding process for unidirectional transport <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> molecules in urea inclusion compounds reported previously...|$|R

5|$|Results May Vary is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rap rock band Limp Bizkit. Released on September 23, 2003, it is the band's only release under the sole-leadership of vocalist Fred Durst after the {{temporary}} departure of guitarist Wes Borland, who left the band in 2001. Snot guitarist Mike Smith was initially brought in to replace Borland, although the band's falling-out with Smith later lead to his departure, {{with much of the}} material recorded with him being discarded from the final release.

5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that could also be a good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar to a couple of other recent episodes.|$|E

In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Slash's Snakepit, Slash {{announced}} he was to begin working on a solo album. Instead he later worked with The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project. Together with his former Guns N' Roses bandmates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, they formed The Project, that eventually became the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver following the addition of former Wasted Youth guitarist Dave Kushner, and then-former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. They released their debut album Contraband, in 2004, followed by Libertad in 2007, before they parted ways with Weiland and went on hiatus in 2008. With Velvet Revolver on hiatus, Slash began work on his debut solo album. Slash was released on March 31, 2010, and featured a number <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> such as Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother, M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Kid Rock, Ozzy Osbourne, Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, and Fergie. His band for the tour {{in support of the}} album consisted of Kennedy, bassist Todd Kerns, and drummer Brent Fitz. It also included guitarist Bobby Schneck, formerly of Slash's Blues Ball.|$|E
30|$|A {{key problem}} {{in this study is}} {{distinguishing}} phases that exsolved from garnet versus phases that were overgrown and trapped by garnet (trapped inclusions). We combined microscopic observations, phase mapping by laser Raman spectroscopy, and element mapping by EMP-WDS and used the following criteria to identify exsolved phases: (1) preferred orientation <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> grains indicating a crystallographic relationship between guest grains and host garnet; (2) presence <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> grains in several garnet host crystals of the same type (see below); (3) homogeneous distributions <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> grains in certain areas of garnet host; (4) elemental depletion halos in host garnet around grains (e.g., Ti-poor halo in garnet around Ti-bearing amphibole grain); and (5) a high number <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> grains occurring within garnet host. We regarded inclusion phases satisfying at least three among these five conditions as exsolved phases (i.e., not trapped inclusions) in the strict sense.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the large}} {{individual}} benefits <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> {{work by the}} poor in rich countries, agencies charged with global poverty reduction do little to facilitate guest work. This may be because guest work {{is viewed as a}} repugnant transaction 2 ̆ 013 one whose harmful side-effects might cause third parties to discourage it. This paper sets out six criteria for a transaction to be repugnant in consequentialist terms, and conducts uncommon tests for repugnance: It uses these criteria to formulate several empirical tests for the repugnance <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> work by Indian construction workers in the United Arab Emirates. It separates the effects <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> work from the correlates <b>of</b> <b>guest</b> work using a natural experiment that quasi-exogenously allocated guest work among a group of several thousand job applicants. The effects offer little evidence that guest work in this setting is typically the cause of repugnant consequences...|$|R

5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series <b>of</b> <b>guests.</b> This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a closed set, with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track <b>of</b> <b>guests,</b> and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, and Mel Brooks. Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E

5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{industry}} is subdivided into gambling, hospitality, restaurants, beach bars and cafés. National visitors are prevalent and from diverse localities. In 1876, Ramalho Ortigão noticed that Póvoa was {{very popular in}} all social ranks in Northern Portugal. In the contemporary period, the construction of motorways negatively affected overnight stays in local hotels. This has been leveled by a noticeable attraction of Portuguese living abroad and foreign tourists {{and the number of}} hotel rooms in 2014 increased to 1.774. Most of those tourists are French or from diverse countries in Northern Europe. International tourists sleeping in the city's hotels represented 35.1% <b>of</b> <b>guests</b> in 2013, up from 30.3% in 2001. Informal local accommodation, especially typical homes in rua Latino Coelho, is a popular alternative for long stays. Póvoa de Varzim has the longest overnight stays for foreign tourists in Metropolitan Porto who stay, on average, 3 days.|$|E
5|$|Gardens, or yards, around medieval castles, abbeys {{and houses}} were formal {{and in the}} European {{tradition}} of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard. They were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling in 1501 and James V at Holyrood in 1536, where archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens. Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland and Linlithgow, including the king's knot garden at Stirling. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from the troubles {{of the world and}} were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649). Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries for the entertainment <b>of</b> <b>guests.</b> Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.|$|E
