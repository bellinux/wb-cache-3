5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> he had been suspended for the entire {{first quarter of the}} game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and {{salinization}} affecting {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E

Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.|$|E

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E
25|$|Russian author Leo Tolstoy championed reform {{for his own}} country, {{particularly}} in education. Tolstoy did not consider his most famous work, War and Peace to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written {{at that time to}} be novels). This view becomes less surprising if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> Tolstoy was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life. War and Peace (which is to Tolstoy really an epic in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that Anna Karenina was his first true novel.|$|E
25|$|Historians James Rawls and Walton Bean {{have speculated}} that {{were it not for}} the {{discovery}} of gold in 1848, Oregon might have been granted statehood ahead of California, and therefore the first Pacific Railroad might have been built to that state, or at least been born to a more benevolent group of founding fathers. This speculation lacks support, however, when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> a significant hide and tallow trade between California and the eastern seaports was already well-established, that the federal government had long planned for the acquisition of San Francisco Bay as a western port, and that suspicions regarding England's intentions towards potentially extending their holdings in the region southward into California would almost certainly have forced the government to embark on the same course of action.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence is all the more impressive when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no corrective feedback is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of empirical support for a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E
500|$|His close {{relationship}} with Deguchi introduced Ueshiba to various members of Japan's far-right; members of the ultranationalist group the Sakurakai would hold meetings at Ueshiba's dojo, and he developed a friendship with the philosopher Shūmei Ōkawa during this period, as well as meeting with Nisshō Inoue and Kozaburō Tachibana. Deguchi also offered Ueshiba's services as a bodyguard to Kingoro Hashimoto, the Sakurakai's founder. Ueshiba's commitment {{to the goal of}} world peace, stressed by many biographers, must be viewed in the light of these relationships and his Ōmoto-kyō beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> Ōmoto-kyō's view of world peace was [...] of a benevolent dictatorship by the Emperor of Japan, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, various {{philosophers}} such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor {{tried to}} resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called [...] "folk psychology" [...] while adhering to a materialist {{vision of the world}} which did not violate the [...] "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.|$|E

500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>that</b> he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked {{out there with the}} Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
