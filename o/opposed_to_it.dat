5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E
5|$|Tatum {{considered}} resigning {{in order}} to enter business. University president Byrd, a staunch patron of football at the school, was preparing to campaign for governor, and Tatum feared his successor would significantly {{reduce the number of}} athletic scholarships available. He and Byrd, however, had also disagreed over the decision to participate in bowl games in violation of conference rules. Tatum was <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> as it greatly increased the difficulty of scheduling and had caused the reduction in number of home games.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} crisis surrounding Leopold III's role during the occupation, {{and whether he}} could return to the throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> After a general strike and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E

As she is dragged into a car, her dropped purse shows {{that her father}} is Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Watts is then seen briefing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on the kidnapping, as a witness describes one abductor, who was wearing a mask like those issued to U.S. troops in the Gulf War. FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that Watts failed to mention of the Millennium Group or those <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E
