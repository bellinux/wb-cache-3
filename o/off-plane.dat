A higher ratio of oxygen atoms can be formed in the N 2 O-carbon reaction, because of the lower dissociation energy of N 2 O, which results in a higher ratio of <b>off-plane</b> epoxy oxygen atoms.

Surprisingly, this detection {{does not extend}} to Nai atoms, in contradiction with our modelling of the emission lines {{in and out of}} the mid-plane of the disk. Aims. We propose that the presence of these <b>off-plane</b> Caii ions (and to a lesser extent Fei atoms), and the non-{{detection of}} <b>off-plane</b> Nai atoms, could be the consequence of the evaporation process of Falling Evaporating Bodies (FEBs), i. e., star-grazing planetesimals that evaporate in the immediate vicinity of the star. Methods. Our model is two-fold. Firstly, we show numerically and theoretically that in the star-grazing regime, the FEBs are subject to inclination oscillations up to 30 – 40 ◦, and that most metallic species released during each FEB sublimation keep track of their initial orbital inclination while starting a free expansion away from the star, blown out by a strong radiation pressure. Secondly, the <b>off-plane</b> Caii and Fei species must be stopped prior to their detection at rest with respect to the star, about 100 AU away.

This dynamical process of inclination oscillations explains the presence of <b>off-plane</b> Caii (and Fei).
