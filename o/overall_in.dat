40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>overall</b> inequality <b>in</b> China and the contributions of physical capital, human capital and social capital.

Possible policy implications of these results are that measures should be taken to pursue more even distributed investment of physical capital and to increase people’s education in order to reduce <b>overall</b> inequality <b>in</b> China...|$|R
