40|$|Abstract. Turbine cascade {{aerodynamic}} {{losses are}} heavily related to incidence. Conventional researches have {{been focused on}} a single blade row upon the convention that the whole turbine cascade has a universal incidence for all blades on the cascade and accordingly the overall aerodynamic loss of the cascade {{is the same as}} a single blade row. However, there are exceptional situations in engineering practice that each blade of a turbine cascade has a different incidence. When a turbine disk is inclined to its design position due to manufacturing errors and/or <b>operating</b> <b>malfunctions,</b> the incidence for a blade on the cascade varies along the circumference of the turbine disk. For such case, the conventional research conclusions are no longer adequate. The present paper is motivated to extend the conventional researches to account for such case. Based on the-state-of-the-art works in this field, new sophisticated correlations for turbine cascade aerodynamic losses were developed to cope with the problems with turbine disk inclination. Numerical simulations were performed {{to examine the effects of}} turbine disk inclination on the aerodynamic losses. Beneficial conclusions and remarks are given in the end...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A cycloconverter-fed {{gearless}} {{mill drive}} is a drive {{system that has}} hardware and software protection functions to protect the equipment in case of abnormal <b>operating</b> conditions, <b>malfunctions</b> or failures. For demanding applications in the mining industry, protections systems need to be reviewed considering special or abnormal operating conditions {{as well as the}} need of high system availability. Some protection functions have tripped in the gearless mill drives operating at Minera Escondida and have been reviewed subsequently. This paper describes improvements in the protection system implemented in the gearless mill drives currently operating at the Laguna Seca concentrator of Minera Escondida Ltda. The background of the new protection functions, related analysis and solutions are explained and experimental results are presented showing their operation.

5000|$|The {{oxygen sensor}} {{is the basis}} of the {{closed-loop}} control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with OBD II, a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O2 levels. The O2 levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O2 is [...] "switching", the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will <b>operate</b> a <b>malfunction</b> indicator lamp and affect engine performance. Simple [...] "oxygen sensor simulators" [...] have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet. Although these are not legal for on-road use, they have been used with mixed results. Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel-economical lean burn that may, however, damage the engine or the catalytic converter.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} data {{recovery}} scenario involves an <b>operating</b> system failure, <b>malfunction</b> of a storage device, logical failure of storage devices, accidental damage or deletion, etc. (typically, on a single-drive, single-partition, single-OS system), {{in which case}} the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive. This can be easily accomplished using a Live CD, many of which provide a means to mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media, and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software. Such cases can often be mitigated by disk partitioning and consistently storing valuable data files (or copies of them) on a different partition from the replaceable OS system files.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Heating, {{ventilating}} and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems consume 43 % of the energy used by buildings. This percentage grows when the HVAC system <b>operates</b> with <b>malfunctions.</b> Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods are developed to reduce abnormal events and down-times and to promote energy saving use of equipment. Most FDD methodologies for HVAC systems {{found in the literature}} revolve around first principle models and mathematical models. This dissertation describes a FDD solution based on process history data and artificial neural network (ANN) models. ANN models, of HVAC components, are built from fault-free operation data. Faulty data are then used with the ANN models to build various residuals and statistical residual transformations. From these residuals, unique residual patterns are assigned to discern between a variety of malfunctions. This FDD strategy is, firstly, applied to a static pressure control loop and secondly, applied to the overall power consumption of an HVAC system. In both studies, the FDD system successfully detected and classified unwanted anomalies - some deviating as little as 5 % from normal operational standards. Finally, the FDD system is rated according to a common set of criteria reviewed in the literature study. This criterion shows the FDD strategy to be robust and adaptable, with low modelling and computational requirements. Master...|$|R
40|$|The SIMFAC {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} the design, development, and {{performance}} verification of the shuttle remote manipulator system (SRMS) to be installed in the space shuttle orbiter. The facility provides for realistic man-in-the-loop operation of the SRMS by an operator in the operator complex, a flightlike crew station patterned after the orbiter aft flight deck with all necessary man machine interface elements, including SRMS displays and controls and simulated out-of-the-window and CCTV scenes. The characteristics of the manipulator system, including arm and joint servo dynamics and control algorithms, are simulated by a comprehensive mathematical model within the simulation subsystem of the facility. Major studies carried out using SIMFAC include: SRMS parameter sensitivity evaluations; the development, evaluation, and verification of <b>operating</b> procedures; and <b>malfunction</b> simulation and analysis of malfunction performance.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{malfunction}} diagnosis in energy {{systems can be}} approached using an expert system which compares the experimental data measured by the plant acquisition system and the calculated data evaluated by a plant simulator under the same operating conditions. In this paper the rules that form the "knowledge base" of the expert system are not assigned heuristically by trying to code the expertise of plant personnel, as it is usually done, but they are artificially and randomly generated by the recombination and selection operators of an evolutionary algorithm. A two-objective optimization problem is set up, in order {{to search for the}} optimal sets of rules having the minimum complexity but simultaneously maximizing the number of correct fault identifications for a given set of <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>operating</b> conditions.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a testing}} method {{suitable}} for strengthening fault tolerance {{in the event}} of unexpected situations within a software system is presented. It is based on the idea of testing an integrated system, by substituting system components with other, similar in design and functionality that operate in an erroneous and even malicious manner. The approach adopted, is similar to the concept of inserting a virus within an organization so that the defense mechanisms of the latter can be tested and the necessary lines of defense are formed, so that the virus cannot affect any of the organization critical parts. The focal point is to ensure that in case of a module malfunction, the integrated system will continue to <b>operate,</b> isolating the <b>malfunctioning</b> software at the greatest possible extend, preventing the erroneous behavior from affecting other (and sometimes critical) modules. The testing method proposed is based first on isolated components testing adopting and enhancing the Component Off The Self method, and second on integrated system testing using malicious components that emulate erroneous operation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{integration}} of GNSS and inertial sensors, any potential sensor failures or faulty measurements due to harsh <b>operating</b> environments or <b>malfunctions</b> of sensor components may result in poorly estimated navigation parameters. If the sensor component failures or faulty measurements occur and cannot be detected immediately, overall system performances will de degraded. Thus, real time detection of failures in estimations system is critically important, particularly for some safety or liability-critical applications. Therefore, it is certainly necessary to implement an online fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm. Various approaches of fault detection and isolation have been proposed and implemented, {{and at the same}} time, the Minimum Detectable Biases (MDBs) in the GNSS/INS integration and the impact of these MDBs on the estimated navigation parameters can also be defined. However, in order to identify and remove the specific faulty measurements, the system should have the ability to separate these faults. This paper presents the latest separability analysis for multiple fault scenarios within the GNSS/INS integration, which is of importance in developing future robust positioning and navigation systems with the fault detection and isolation procedures...|$|R
40|$|During {{a signal}} malfunction, traffic signals are {{operated}} in the flash mode. During this event, drivers {{are presented with}} one of two possible scenarios: (1) flashing yellow on the major street and flashing red on the minor street or (2) flashing red on all approaches. Yellow/red flash is typically the default mode utilized based on the expectation that red/red flash would produce an intolerable amount of delay. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to date on flashing operations, with exception of low-volume nighttime conditions. A traffic signal malfunction can occur during any time of the day, potentially placing the signal into flash mode under moderate to peak traffic volume conditions. In order to assess the safety implications of these events and improve the process by which the mode of flash (yellow/red versus red/red) is selected, the research contained in this study evaluated driver behavior and the operational characteristics of intersections <b>operating</b> in <b>malfunction</b> flash mode under a wide spectrum of traffic demands. Analysis of field data collected at thirteen study intersections in the Atlanta, Georgia area found that confusion exists among drivers approaching a signal in flash mode. The analysis found that a significant percentage of vehicles stop on a yellow indication. It was seen that an intersection flashing yellow/red could operate as a two-way stop or four-way stop, potentially transitioning between these two alternatives on a minute-by-minute basis. This creates an increased potential for crashes and further compounds the problem of driver expectancy by creating a constantly changing control environment. The stopping on yellow also introduces additional delay, which reduces the operational benefit of utilizing the yellow/red flash mode. Furthermore, a high level of traffic violations was observed for the flashing red indications for both yellow/red and red/red flashing operation. Based upon the study results, providing one consistent mode of flashing operation may be a reasonable solution to improving driver expectancy and safety. Red/red flashing operation is the preferred mode as it reduces vehicle speeds and the variability in the number of vehicles stopping, while improving driver expectancy. M. S.
