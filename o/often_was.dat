5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk <b>often</b> <b>was</b> placed in the genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite <b>often</b> <b>was</b> different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E

5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it <b>often</b> <b>was</b> paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey <b>often</b> <b>was</b> plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|An {{offensive}}ly-minded defenceman, Niedermayer {{was best}} known for his skating ability and drew comparison's to the game's offensive greats from the time he broke into the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often chafed at playing within the Devils' defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left his coaches lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but <b>often</b> <b>was</b> not. By {{the end of his career}} however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game's greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history to win every major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation <b>often</b> <b>was</b> as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

25|$|In the {{classical}} period of Greek mythology, Artemis was {{often described as}} the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she <b>often</b> <b>was</b> depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows. The deer and the cypress were sacred to her. In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of Eileithyia in aiding childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed <b>often</b> <b>was</b> calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E

The meaning of Blood of Isis is more obscure, but the tyet <b>often</b> <b>was</b> used as a funerary amulet made of red wood, stone, or glass, so this may simply have been {{a description of the}} appearance of the materials used.|$|E
