5|$|Indian {{restaurants}} and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from the stereotypical flock wallpaper and standardised menus. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> was the Bombay Brasserie, {{which opened in}} Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India, and has remained fully booked ever since. It was followed in 1990 by Chutney Mary in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars {{for the quality of}} their cooking.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E

5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> ofan emerging style, {{the work was}} criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many {{of those who were}} in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson never {{received}} formal training, he still possesses a wide vocal range which was trademarked by his quasi-operatic tenor.

5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination he was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which {{is said to have}} cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

5|$|M-53 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that connects Detroit to The Thumb region. The highway starts in Detroit at {{a connection with}} M-3 and ends in Port Austin, Michigan at M-25. In between, the trunkline passes through the northern suburbs of Metro Detroit, connects to freeways like Interstate69 (I-69) and provides access to rural farmland. In Macomb County, M-53 follows the Christopher Columbus Freeway, while {{the remainder of the}} highway is known as Van Dyke Avenue in the metro area or Van Dyke Road elsewhere.

In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{the mayor}} of Tel Aviv Israel Rokach asked the British mandate {{authorities}} for permission to create an airport in Palestine, promising to solve the transportation problem of Jews during the Arab revolt of 193639 when travelling from Tel Aviv through Arab territory to the main airport at Lydda, to catch Palestine Airways flights to Haifa, was difficult and dangerous. Works began on a plot of land north of the Yarkon River, Tel Aviv and when completed in October 1938, the airport served regular flights to Haifa, with the option of flights to Beirut. In 1940, the airport's name was changed to Sde Dov, in memory of Dov Hoz, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> of Jewish aviation. Sde Dov was abandoned after Palestine Airways ceased operations in August 1940 and the site {{was used as a}} British Army base until December 1947 when with British permission the runway was reopened by Haganah.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edmund's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920. His son Sir Arthur was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> of {{documentary}} film {{making in the}} years prior to, {{during and after the}} Second World War, working with John Grierson. He inherited the title on his father's death in 1951. The house was acquired by the Nation, and was given to the National Trust, in part-payment of death duties, in 1960. The West Wing was immediately demolished, being considered to have no architectural or historical significance, to reduce running costs and to return the house to its supposed mediaeval ground plan. Sir Arthur died in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Sir Charles. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is now open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> {{of the use}} of airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, {{as well as a number}} of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. Despite the Prime Minister's desire to have 5,000 airborne troops within a short period, a number of problems were rapidly encountered by the War Office. Very few gliders existed in Britain in 1940, and these were too light for military purposes, and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers. On 10 August, Churchill was informed that although 3,500 volunteers had been selected to train as airborne troops, only 500 could currently begin training due to limitations in equipment and aircraft. The War Office stated in a memorandum to the Prime Minister in December 1940 that 500 parachute troops could probably be trained and be ready for operations by the spring of 1941, but this figure was purely arbitrary; the actual number that could be trained and prepared by that period would rely entirely on the creation of a training establishment and the provision of required equipment.|$|E
