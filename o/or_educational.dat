25|$|The IUCN {{regard the}} Spix's macaw as {{critically}} endangered and possibly extinct {{in the wild}}. Its last known stronghold in the wild was in northeastern Bahia, Brazil, and sightings are very rare. After a 2000 sighting of a male bird, the next sighting was in 2016. The species is now maintained through a captive breeding program at several conservation organizations {{under the aegis of}} the Brazilian government. It is listed on CITES Appendix I, which makes trade illegal except for legitimate conservation, scientific <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> purposes.|$|E
25|$|According to Milliyet {{there are}} 15,000 Greeks in Turkey, while {{according}} to Human Rights Watch the Greek population in Turkey {{was estimated at}} 2,500 in 2006. According to the same source, the Greek population in Turkey was collapsing as the community was by then far too small to sustain itself demographically, due to emigration, much higher death rates than birth rates and continuing discrimination. In recent years however, most notably since the economic crisis in Greece, the trend has reversed. A few hundred to over a thousand Greeks now migrate to Turkey yearly for employment <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> purposes.|$|E

25|$|Maryland's state {{sales tax}} is 6 percent. All real {{property}} in Maryland {{is subject to}} the property tax. Generally, properties that are owned and used by religious, charitable, <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> organizations or property owned by the federal, state or local governments are exempt. Property tax rates vary widely. No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state, meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services. If a proposed tax rate increases the total property tax revenues, the governing body must advertise that fact and hold a public hearing on the new tax rate, which is called the Constant Yield Tax Rate process.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} North-West University Botanical Garden spans {{less than three}} {{hectares}} more than a 1500 plant species can be found here. Most plants in the Botanical Garden are indigenous to South Africa {{with the exception of}} a few exotic plants which are kept for research <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> value. A large section of the garden, around a man-made ridge, is managed as a natural wooded grassland area. A variety of theme gardens make up the rest of the Botanical Garden, including the swamp garden, vlei garden, contemporary indigenous garden, vegetable and herb garden, invader display, plant evolution garden and succulent rockery. Some more common plant genera represented in the garden include Acacia, Aloe, Bonatea, Crinum, Dierama, Encephalartos, Eucomis, Eulophia, Euphorbia, Gasteria, Gladiolus, Haworthia, Hypoxis, Indigofera, Kniphofia, Plectranthus, Podocarpus, Polygala, Scadoxus, Searsia, Stapelia and Zantedeschia.|$|E
25|$|Psycholinguistics or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} of the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, Asachi's most {{important}} contribution to the artistic field was his involvement in attracting foreign painters to the Moldavian scene, by offering them commissions <b>or</b> <b>educational</b> assignments; among these were the Polish Ludwik Stawski and Mauriciu Loeffler, the Italian Giovanni Schiavoni, {{as well as the}} Austrian Josef Adler (noted for authoring an 1833 manual for landscape painting and still life works) and Ioan Müller (who taught figurative art). Of them, Asachi reportedly considered Schiavoni to be the most competent, while he tended to replace most others after reexamining their skills. Another important Italian artist who arrived in Iaşi during that period was the former Carboneria revolutionary Niccoló Livaditti, to whom Asachi did not, however, assign a teaching post. In 1843, four years before the Iaşi Academia was radically transformed, the art classes were disestablished due to the protest of various boyars (who objected to the fact that members of all social groups could attend them).|$|E
