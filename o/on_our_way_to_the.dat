2500|$|Lowell's {{letter to}} the {{president}} was his first major political act of protest, {{but it would not}} be his last. During the mid to late 1960s, Lowell actively opposed the Vietnam War. In response to American air raids in Vietnam in 1965, Lowell rejected an invitation to the White House Festival of the Arts from President Lyndon Johnson in a letter that he subsequently published in The New York Times, stating, [...] "We are in danger of imperceptibly becoming an explosive and suddenly chauvinistic nation, and may even be drifting <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last nuclear ruin." [...] Ian Hamilton notes that [...] "throughout , [...] was in demand as a speaker and petition signer [...] He was vehemently opposed to the war, but equivocal about being identified too closely with the 'peace movement': there were many views he did not share with the more fiery of the 'peaceniks' and it was not in his nature to join movements that he had no wish to lead." [...] However, Lowell did participate in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. against the war {{and was one of the}} featured speakers at the event. Norman Mailer, who was also a featured speaker at the rally, introduced Lowell to the crowd of protesters.|$|E
