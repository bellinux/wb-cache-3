5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. <b>Often</b> <b>she</b> demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more <b>often</b> <b>she</b> displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E

A young student at St. Gall, Ulrich, is said to have visited Wiborada <b>often.</b> <b>She</b> {{supposedly}} prophesied his elevation to the episcopate of Augsburg.|$|E
25|$|Marta {{has three}} siblings, José, Valdir, and Angela. Her parents are Aldário and Tereza. As of 2010, {{she lives in}} San Jose and is a {{competent}} Swedish speaker. On 11 October 2010, Marta was named a UN goodwill ambassador. Marta is fluent in Portuguese, Swedish, and English, and religiously a Catholic and states that God {{is very important to}} her although she does not go to Church that <b>often.</b> <b>She</b> holds dual citizenships for Brazil and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Gustavus Adolphus shared Maria Eleonora's {{interest}} in architecture and {{her love of}} music, while she was sentimentally devoted to her husband. <b>Often,</b> <b>she</b> lamented that she never had her hero for herself. Foreign ambassadors found her gracious and beautiful and she had good taste, although her character showed some extravagant traits. Maria Eleonora had a definite liking for entertainment and sweetmeats, and she soon succumbed to the current fashionable craze for buffoons and dwarfs. She spoke French, the court language of the age, but never bothered to learn to write German or Swedish correctly.|$|E

25|$|In Greek {{classical}} art she {{is usually}} {{portrayed as a}} maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows. <b>Often,</b> <b>she</b> {{is shown in the}} shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of Niobe.|$|E
25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an epigraph from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. <b>Often</b> <b>she</b> uses this epigraph from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life and we can see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that object.|$|E
25|$|Henry was a keen {{writer and}} on this too {{he and his wife}} shared common ground. Ruth was also the author of several books, {{including}} two novels ('Compensation' and 'A History of Departed Things'), a collection of the works of Thomas Hardy (with a foreword by her husband) and a translation of 'Der kleine Tod' ('The Little Death') by the German author Irene Forbes-Mosse. <b>Often</b> <b>she</b> published books as 'Mrs. Henry Head' and most of Head's poems are dedicated to his wife; 'Destroyers and other verses', for example, is inscribed 'To Her without whose touch the strings would have been mute'.|$|E

25|$|Her rites allowed {{women the}} use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things {{otherwise}} forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them {{that she was an}} aspect of Terra, Ops, Cybele, or Ceres, or a Latin form of the Greek goddess Damia. Most <b>often,</b> <b>she</b> was identified as the wife, sister, or daughter of the god Faunus, thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature-goddess Fauna, who could prophesy the fates of women.|$|E
25|$|It is {{only during}} the {{breeding}} season males congregate around a female in estrus for a few hours. All spiral-horned antelope species are polyandrous. Aggression is very low among individuals of both sexes though intraspecific competition does occur. In females often they neck-fight as well poke and snap at each other. Males would use their horns for wrestling where they try to attack the face. Sometimes there is even intimation from the males to persuade the female into submission as <b>often</b> <b>she</b> would try and retaliate. The gestation period occurs once the female has been inseminated from the male successfully. In most species it lasts approximately seven months, although in the larger species this extends to eight or nine months. They only {{give birth to a}} single calf. Once the young are born, they won't wean until they are around five to six months of age. Females sexually mature by two to three years while for males it is four to five years.|$|E
25|$|Her {{changeable}} {{nature is}} reflected throughout her work, {{which has led}} critics and scholars to have very different conclusions about her and her work. Her style often goes {{back and forth between}} classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style <b>often,</b> <b>she</b> differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Her interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. Krasner is often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasizes the importance of her biography since she claims her art is formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.|$|E

25|$|Mary Hanford Ford (November 1, 1856 – February 2, 1937) was an American lecturer, author, art and {{literature}} critic and {{a leader in the}} women's suffrage movement. She reached early notoriety in Kansas at the age of 28 and soon left for the Chicago World's Fair. She was taken up by the society ladies of the Chicago area who, impressed with her talks on art {{and literature}} at the Fair, helped launch her on a new career, initially in Chicago and then across some States. Along the way she was already published in articles and noticed in suffrage meetings. In addition to work as an art critic and speaker she wrote a number of books, most prominently a trilogy Message of the Mystics. Circa 1900-1902 Ford found the Bahá'í Faith through Sarah Farmer, Green Acre, and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and helped form the first community of Bahá'ís in Boston where Louis Bourgeois, future architect of the first Bahá'í House of Worship in the West, then joined the religion. In 1907 Ford went on Bahá'í pilgrimage, in 1910 she started writing Bahá'í books such as The Oriental Rose, and traveled with `Abdu'l-Bahá during some of his journeys in various places in Europe and then America. Ford was blamed for a fiasco among UK suffragists but it was their own violence that got them in trouble. Ford spent the years of World War I in California following the first Bahá'í International Congress at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, and then moved back to New York where she spent almost the next 20 years. <b>Often</b> <b>she</b> traveled to Europe for some months of the year and during this period introduced the religion to Ugo Giachery, later a prominent Bahá'í. Also in this period she was censored off a radio broadcast, helped develop the religion's community both in meetings she supported and literary efforts, before reducing her travels and speaking engagements in the early 1930s. She died with her daughter by her bedside in 1937.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originally}} {{aired on}} May 7, 1987, on NBC at 9:00pm (Eastern) / 8:00pm (Central) and scored a 28.4 rating and 45 share, was watched by 24.8 million homes, and ranked #1 in Nielsen ratings. After the episode originally aired, Kathy Carlisle of Los Angeles Times called this episode [...] "hilarious, but somewhat contrived and very disappointing" [...] {{and felt that}} Sam and Diane should have been married at the end. Monica Collins from USA Today called Diane a [...] "snitty, selfish snob" [...] and was relieved that the character left the series. According to Collins, she has not made friends with people in Cheers onscreen. More <b>often,</b> <b>she</b> has not befriended women, and she has [...] " [...] men more than [...] them".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{completion}} of Jaws in 1975, Fields was hired by Universal Studios as an executive consultant. Some insight into Universal's reasons for hiring her can be gleaned from the fact that during the filming of Jaws, in addition to her editing, Fields had been [...] "omnipresent...at Spielberg's beck and call by means of a walkie-talkie. <b>Often</b> <b>she</b> would shuttle back and forth on her bike between the producers in town and Spielberg at the dock for last-minute decisions". The producers of Jaws were David Brown and Richard Zanuck. Along with Brown, Zanuck, and Peter Benchley (the book's author), Fields helped promote Jaws on the [...] "talk show circuit" [...] in the eight months before its saturation release to 464 theaters on 20 June 1975. Fields had plainly earned the confidence of the producers and of the studio executives at Universal.|$|E

500|$|Although Duff {{recorded}} {{songs like}} [...] "I Can't Wait", [...] "Why Not" [...] and [...] "What Dreams Are Made Of", which received substantial airplay on Radio Disney, executives at Buena Vista Music Group, Duff's record label, planned {{to help her}} reach a more mature audience. So, Andre Recke, an executive at Buena Vista, along with Duff and her mother, enlisted the songwriting and production team [...] "The Matrix" [...] (consisting of Lauren Christy, Scott Spock and Graham Edwards) to produce songs for Duff's debut album Metamorphosis (2003). [...] "So Yesterday" [...] became one of three songs produced by the team for the album, and was the last song recorded for the album. Duff herself has said that when she first heard the song, she did not really like it; however, her opinion changed after she listened to it more <b>often.</b> <b>She</b> then decided she would give the song a [...] "100 percent" [...] and not comment negatively of it. According to her, she [...] "ended up loving it", stating, [...] "It was such a fun song, and it means a lot."

500|$|To {{adjust to}} {{potential}} audio feedback and leakage and obtain a usable take, Chavarria tried having Badu sit in an overstuffed chair six feet behind the mixing console and use alternate microphones {{such as a}} Neumann M 269 or AEA R44 ribbon microphone with Sony MDR-V900 headphones into a Furman headphone mixer. However, Badu felt she could not perceive all of her voice's frequencies with the headphones and often discarded them to move towards the studio monitors. He also considered situating her in an equilateral triangle with the two speakers, one {{of which would be}} placed out of phase in order to have the leakage cancel itself. However, according to him, the mic has to be stationary, while Badu [...] "likes to hold the mic like an MC. She is at home as a live performer." [...] He said of working around audio spills and adapting to Badu's methods, [...] "We worked to make her vocals fit into the track, phase-wise ... What did work was to keep the monitors fairly low and turn the microphone out of phase, and we would move her around the room until she found a spot where the leakage was reasonable and where she felt comfortable and could hear herself. But just as <b>often</b> <b>she</b> would just sit in that chair behind the board in the A Room." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Eudora Welty noted Pilgrims narrator being [...] "the {{only person in}} [...] book, {{substantially}} {{the only one in}} her world .... Speaking of the universe very <b>often,</b> <b>she</b> is yet self-surrounded". [...] Dillard seemingly refers to the idea of an [...] "invisible narrator" [...] in the sixth chapter of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek; while referring to the [...] "infinite power" [...] of God, the narrator notes that [...] "invisibility is the all-time great 'cover'". [...] Nancy C. Parrish, author of the 1998 book Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers, notes that despite its having been written in the first person, Pilgrim is not necessarily autobiographical. [...] The narrator, [...] "Annie Dillard", therefore becomes a persona through which the author can experience and describe [...] "thoughts and events that the real Annie Dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined." [...] Critic Suzanne Clark also points to the [...] "peculiar evasiveness" [...] of Dillard-the-author, noting that [...] "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't know who is writing. [...] There is a silence in the place where there might be an image of the social self—of personality, character, or ego". [...] While most critics assume that the narrator is female, mostly due to the autobiographical elements of the book and the assumption that the narrator is Dillard herself, Clark questions whether the narrator is male. [...] Stating that Dillard uses [...] "a variety of male voices, male styles" [...] throughout the book, Clark asks, [...] "When Dillard quit writing Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in the persona of a fifty year old man, did she then begin to write as a woman?" ...|$|E
