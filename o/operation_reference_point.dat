In this study, we empirically {{investigate the}} effects of <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> on fairness judgments {{with the help of}} the vignette technique. Specifically, we examine (i) whether <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> have influence on fairness judgments or not, (ii) if and how counter-intuitive <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> influence fairness judgments, and (iii) how the asymmetry of <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> shape fairness judgments. For that purpose, we use a within-subject design, in which participants are confronted with three versions of vignette: vignettes without <b>reference</b> <b>point,</b> vignettes with salient <b>reference</b> <b>point,</b> and vignettes with counter-intuitive <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> Consequently, our findings suggest that (i) the <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> significantly influence fairness judgments, (ii) introducing counter-intuitive <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> moderate the salience of <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> and (iii) the asymmetry of salient <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> has a concave relationship with fairness judgments, while the asymmetry of counter-intuitive <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> does not affect fairness judgments.

40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>point</b> {{approaches}} for multi-objective problems {{rely on the}} definition of an achievement scalarizing function that projects <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> onto the non-dominated solution set. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> using a Tchebycheff metric-based scalarizing function in multi-objective pure integer linear programming (MOILP). Since the non-dominated solutions are discrete in MOILP, there are multiple <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> {{that lead to the}} same solution, i. e. there are indifference sets on the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> space. We investigate some properties of the <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> in MOILP and also the graphical representation of indifference sets for tri-objective problems. We further investigate properties of the <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> when additional limitations on the objective function values are introduced. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We find that the reference effect exists for asymmetrically dominated <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> {{but we do not}} see any evidence of reference effect for symmetrically dominated <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> Our experiment can also distinguish among the models of reference-dependence with exogenously determined <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> even though these models were initially constructed in order to explain the same choice anomalies.
