5|$|The {{colocation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E
5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} traits {{of the character}} Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), {{and some of her}} traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, Evangelions mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure, and the abstract designs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels,</b> also {{had a significant impact on}} the designs of future anime productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{school has}} one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels,</b> the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are {{both within the}} towers of St Peter's Church, and are not {{normally}} used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel {{is the home of}} the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|E
50|$|Archaeologists theorize that by 1450 CE with <b>the</b> {{collapse}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angel</b> chiefdom, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angel</b> {{people had}} relocated downriver to <b>the</b> confluence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio and Wabash rivers.

25|$|In 2010, {{a replica}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angel</b> de la Independencia {{was brought to}} Zócalo as a way <b>of</b> {{spreading}} out <b>the</b> protesters from <b>the</b> original <b>Angel</b> site.

5|$|Wiggins {{grew up in}} California and {{attended}} Pasadena City College before being drafted by the California Angels in 1977. He played in the minor league systems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> and the Los Angeles Dodgers, setting a professional baseball single-season record with 120 stolen bases in 1980. He made his major league debut with the San Diego Padres in 1981, and he became a regular player within two years. In 1983, he set the Padres' single-season stolen base record, a mark which he extended the following season. His 1984 stolen bases total (70) is still a team record as of 2017.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>angels.</b> Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{government}} columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon {{is due to}} close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.|$|E
